      "When revoking supervised release and imposing a prison sentence, may a district court consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014namely, 'the seriousness of the offense,' 'promot[ing] respect for the law,' and 'just punishment'\u2014even though these factors are not explicitly referenced in the supervised release statute?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In January 2020, Edgardo Esteras began a six-year term of supervised release following imprisonment for drug trafficking offenses. Three years into his supervised release, in January 2023, his probation officer reported violations including domestic violence and firearm possession, though the related criminal charges were dismissed at the victim's request. At a violation hearing, Judge Pearson found that Esteras had possessed a firearm while on supervised release. Concerned that previous sentences had failed to deter him, she imposed an above-guidelines sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment plus three years of supervised release with special conditions including anger management and location monitoring. Though Esteras objected to the court\u2019s consideration of certain statutory factors related to punishment, Judge Pearson maintained that she also weighed deterrence and public safety, while acknowledging that some supervision conditions had both punitive and rehabilitative aspects.\n\nOn appeal, Esteras challenged his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on prohibited factors in sentencing him, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.",

My uncertainty about \u03b8 is extremely high.\n\n**Design Effectiveness (D):** I have no prior knowledge about the best way to predict outcomes in cases involving statutory interpretation of federal sentencing laws. For example, I don't know how the current Court typically weighs textualism versus legislative purpose in this context, or how influential a circuit split or the Solicitor General's position might be.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Gather Core Arguments (\u03b8):** My first priority is to understand the arguments of the parties involved. This is the most direct way to reduce my uncertainty about the case itself. The best documents for this are the briefs filed by the Petitioner (Esteras) and the Respondent (United States).\n2.  **Analyze Legal Context (\u03b8 & D):** Once I understand the core arguments, I can investigate the key precedents and determine if there is a circuit split on this issue. This informs both the specific case (\u03b8) and the general importance of the issue (D).\n3.  **Seek Predictive Indicators (D):** I will look for information that has high predictive value, such as the position of the Solicitor General and the arguments made in amicus briefs from influential organizations.\n4.  **Synthesize and Refine (D):** I will search for meta-level analysis on how the Court handles similar statutory interpretation cases to help me weigh the competing legal arguments.\n\n**First Action:**\nTo begin, I need to retrieve the foundational document outlining the petitioner's case. This will provide the legal framework, arguments, and cited precedents from Esteras's perspective. This action directly targets the largest area of my current uncertainty (\u03b8). I will search for the main brief filed by the petitioner.\n",

However, it creates a highly efficient plan for reducing that uncertainty by identifying the most crucial documents (petitioner's brief) to target next. This strategic planning significantly increases the expected information gain of the entire sequence of future actions, making it a valuable, albeit indirect, contribution to solving the task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The action has high design-level value. By explicitly separating task parameters (\u03b8) from design strategies (D) and formulating a generalizable plan (check briefs, look for circuit splits, find the SG's position, analyze judicial methods), the agent is effectively learning and articulating a robust methodology (D) for SCOTUS prediction. This plan is a significant update from a state of 'no prior knowledge' to a structured, multi-factor predictive model, applicable beyond just this specific case.",

Similarly, the design beliefs reflect only a minimal awareness that multiple factors might influence judicial decisions but lack any developed strategic approach, placing design complexity at the low end (0.2). The beliefs are internally consistent and logically integrated, as the agent explicitly recognizes its lack of knowledge and plans to gather information, supporting a moderately high coherence score (0.7). However, the overall information density is very low (0.1) because the beliefs contain minimal substantive detail or data. The confidence is high (0.9) because the assessment is straightforward given the explicit statements of no prior knowledge.",

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison, the statutory \nmaximum, plus six years of supervised release. JA 215a, \n228a.\nJaimez appealed. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. The \ncourt noted that the district court \u201cexpressly consider[ed]\u201d \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors: \u201cthe seriousness of his \noffense, the promotion of respect for the law, and the \nprovision of just punishment.\u201d JA 232a. But the panel \nmajority, relying on Lewis and Esteras, rejected Jaimez\u2019s \nargument that the court erred by doing so: \u201cwe\u2019ve made \nclear that district courts may nonetheless consider these \nfactors when imposing revocation sentences.\u201d Id.\nc.\u2003 Toriano Leaks\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Leaks \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby failing to report to the probation office as directed, \nfailing to attend mental-health treatment, failing to work \ntoward his GED, and committing new state offenses, for \nwhich the state court sentenced him to a total of four to six \nyears in prison. JA 239a-241a. The district court revoked \nhis supervised release and sentenced him to 12 months \nin prison, to be served consecutive to his state sentences. \nJA 244a, 248a. Explaining its decision to order that the \nsentences run consecutively, the court stated: \u201cConcurrent \n\n12\ntime does not punish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision \nand\u2014and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that is not justice.\u201d JA 244a (ellipses in \ntranscript).\nLeaks appealed, arguing that the district court erred \nby basing its sentence on a Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor: \nthe need to provide just punishment. Relying on Lewis \nand Esteras, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. JA 251a.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nBy omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, Congress instructed courts not to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. That is the \nonly conclusion that gives effect to the statutory text, \nincluding the text in neighboring statutes that do not omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). And it reflects Congress\u2019s goals in \ncreating supervised release, as reflected in the text, the \nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act, and subsequent \namendments: creating a forward-looking framework for \ncourts to protect the public while assisting offenders as \nthey transition back into society.\na.\u2003 The analysis can begin and end with the text. \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when imposing supervised \nrelease and when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease. That omission was intentional, and courts may \nnot add omitted text to a statute. Additionally, at the \nsame time Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the supervised-release statute, \nit included those factors in the lists for courts to consider \nwhen imposing prison, probation, or a fine, and it included \n\n13\nthem in the list for courts to consider when modifying \nor revoking probation. Under the negative-implication \ncanon (expressio unius est exclusio alterius), Congress \nthus further instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nCompare the statutes governing probation revocation \nand supervised-release revocation. Under the former, \ncourts are to consider \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03565(a). Under the latter, courts are to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Under the interpretation \nadopted by the court of appeals, that omission makes no \ndifference, and courts can consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors in either context. But giving effect to the different \nlanguage in the two provisions, the text establishes that \ncourts may not consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised release.\nb.\u2003 That conclusion also reflects the history of the \nSRA and subsequent amendments. Through the SRA, \nCongress abolished indeterminant sentencing and \nthe practice of using prison to attempt to rehabilitate \noffenders before releasing them on parole. It created \nsupervised release as a new discretionary supplement \nto a fixed prison term, used to encourage rehabilitation \nand assist newly released inmates as they transition back \ninto society. Reflecting Congress\u2019s rehabilitative goals, \nthe original statute did not even provide a mechanism for \nrevoking supervised release aside from a new prosecution \nfor criminal contempt or a separate offense. And, as \n\n14\nit does to this day, the statute instructed courts not to \nconsider retribution when modifying supervised release \nby omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of factors \nfor courts to consider.\nSubsequent amendments have reaffirmed Congress\u2019s \nnonretributive goals for supervised release. When \nCongress amended the supervised-release statute to \nadd a revocation mechanism, it maintained the list that \nexcluded Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. And \nCongress has three times amended the statute since then \nto add other forward-looking factors for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. It has added Section 3553(a)(2)(C) (the \nneed to protect the public) and (a)(7) (the need to provide \nrestitution), but not Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\nc.\u2003 The interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nposes constitutional problems. As this Court has said, \nconstruing revocation and subsequent imprisonment as \npunishment for violating supervised-release conditions \nwould raise serious constitutional questions regarding, \nfor example, the jury-trial right and double-jeopardy \nprotection. But the decisions below allow courts to do \nexactly that.\nd.\u2003 Applying the text as written is not \u201cunworkable,\u201d \nas the court of appeals said. Excluding the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors allows courts to consider all relevant \ninformation when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, filtered through only the purposes of sentencing \nthat Congress has determined apply in that context: \ndeterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but not \nretribution. Courts must consider only those purposes \n\n15\nwhen imposing supervised release, adopting conditions \nthat it deems appropriate for protecting the public while \nassisting the defendant as he or she transitions back into \nsociety. And courts must consider only those purposes \nwhen modifying or revoking supervising release, using \nadditional time in custody, if necessary, as a tool to protect \nthe public or compel the defendant into complying with the \nconditions imposed. If the defendant\u2019s conduct is criminal \nand warrants retributive punishment, a new prosecution is \nthe mechanism, not a revocation sentence. Nothing about \nthis framework is unworkable.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The plain text of Section 3583 and neighboring \nstatutes dictates that Congress precluded courts \nfrom considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when imposing, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe statutory text alone resolves the question \npresented. Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nSection 3583\u2019s lists of factors for courts to consider when \nimposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking supervised \nrelease. Because courts may not add omitted text to a \nstatute, that omission precludes courts from considering \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Moreover, while omitting \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from the supervised-release statute, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when listing \nfactors for courts to consider in other contexts. Applying \nthe negative-implication canon, and giving effect to the \ndifferent text in different provisions of the SRA, the \nomission in Section 3583(e) thus bars consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors.\n\n16\na.\u2003 Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe list of factors for courts to consider when imposing \nsupervised release and when terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release. That omission was \nintentional, and courts may not add omitted text to the \nstatute. The plain text of Section 3583 thus precludes \ncourts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors.\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory \ninterpretation that \u2018absent provision[s] cannot be supplied \nby the courts.\u2019\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) \n(quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012)). \nAdding omitted provisions \u201c\u2018is not a construction of the \nstatute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court.\u2019\u201d \nNichols v. United States, 578 U.S. 104, 110 (2016) (quoting \nIselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 251 (1926)). \u201c\u2018To \nsupply omissions transcends the judicial function.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Iselin, 270 U.S. at 251).\nIn 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), Congress set forth factors for \ncourts to consider when deciding what sentence to impose. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a). Subsection (a)(2) requires courts \nto consider:\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003 to reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide \njust punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n\n17\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further crimes \nof the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner[.]\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2). The subsection (a)(2) factors \ncorrespond to \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \nrehabilitation,\u201d which are \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally.\u201d Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 325 (2011).\nSection 3583(c) lists factors from Section 3553(a) for \ncourts to consider when imposing supervised release: \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.1\nThrough that omission, Congress instructed courts to \nconsider the listed factors, and not Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors, when imposing supervised release. \nThis Court has said as much. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326 \n(\u201cThese provisions make clear that a particular purpose \nmay apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind \nof sentence under consideration. For example, a court may \nnot take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release. \n1.\u2002 Congress also omitted Section 3553(a)(3), \u201cthe kinds of \nsentences available,\u201d from the list of factors in Section 3583(c). \nWhen a court is considering whether to impose supervised release \nfollowing a prison term, supervised release is the only sentence \navailable. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a).\n\n18\nSee \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\u201d (emphasis in original)); see also Concepcion \nv. United States, 597 U.S. 481, 495 (2022) (same). So has \nthe Government. See Reply Brief for the United States, \nTapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011) (No. 10-5400), \n2011 U.S. S.\u00a0Ct. Briefs LEXIS 451, *20 (\u201cSection 3583(c) \nexplicitly lists each Section 3553(a) factor that courts \nmust consider and omits the factors whose consideration \nCongress intended to preclude. See 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).\u201d).\nSimilarly, Section 3583(e) lists factors from Section \n3553(a) for courts to consider when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release. The list is the \nsame as Section 3583(c): \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Congress omitted Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) from that list as well.2\nJust as omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list \nof factors in Section 3583(c) means that courts may not \nconsider those factors when imposing supervised release, \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 326, so does the same omission in \nSection 3583(e) mean that courts may not consider \nthose factors when terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. \u201cThe statute says what it says\u2014or \nperhaps better put here, does not say what it does not \nsay.\u201d Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Ret.

Miqbel, 444 F.3d \n1173, 1182 (9th Cir. 2006) (same).\nb.\u2003\nThe differences between Section 3583 and \nneighboring provisions confirm this conclusion. When \nCongress listed factors for courts to consider when \nsentencing a defendant, it included Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing prison, probation, or a \nfine, but not when imposing supervised release. Likewise, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking probation, \nbut not when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nUnder the principle of expressio unius est exclusio \nalterius, the negative-implication canon, Congress thus \ninstructed courts not to consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when imposing supervised release under Section \n3583(c) or when modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e). Applying this principle is the only \nway to give effect to the different language Congress used \nin the different sections of the SRA.\n\u201cWhen Congress includes particular language in \none section of a statute but omits it from a neighbor, [this \nCourt] normally understand[s] that difference in language \nto convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius).\u201d Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 94 (2023). The Court has referred to this principle as \n\u201can ancient maxim,\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), and a \n\u201ctraditional rule of statutory construction,\u201d Bittner, 598 \n\n20\nU.S. at 94. It has special force where, as here, \u201cCongress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act.\u201d Russello \nv. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n498 U.S. 395, 404-05 (1991) (same).\nCongress drafted and enacted the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, and has amended it since, against \nthis background. The SRA directs judges to sentence \nall defendants to prison, probation, or a fine, and allows \njudges to impose a fine in addition to prison or probation. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03551(b) & (c). The Act permits judges to \nimpose supervised release to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a). And it specifies which factors apply \nto the different sentencing options, instructing courts to \nconsider:\n\u2022\t for prison, \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, \nrecognizing that imprisonment is not an \nappropriate means of promoting correction \nand rehabilitation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a);\n\u2022\t for fines, eight listed factors \u201cin addition to \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a);\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cthe factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n\n21\n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(c).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin neighboring statutes but not in Section 3583(c), Congress \ninstructed courts not to consider those factors when \nimposing supervised release. That conclusion flows from \na straightforward application of the negative-implication \ncanon. Congress included \u201cparticular language\u201d\u2014Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014in not just \u201cone section of a statute\u201d but \nseveral sections of the SRA, while \u201comit[ting] it from \na neighbor\u201d\u2014Section 3583(c). Bittner, 598 U.S. at 94. \nThat \u201cdifference in language .\u00a0.\u00a0. convey[s] a difference \nin meaning (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).\u201d Id.; \ncf. Concepcion, 597 U.S. at 495 (noting that, in Section \n3583(c), Congress \u201cexpressly precluded\u201d district courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors).\nThe SRA also specifies which factors apply when \ncourts consider whether to modify or revoke probation \nor supervised release:\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cafter considering the factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cafter considering \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\n\n22\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(e).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors in a neighboring statute but not in Section 3583(e), \nCongress instructed courts not to consider those factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release. That \nconclusion again flows from a straightforward application \nof the negative-implication canon.\nThat is the only interpretation that gives effect to \nthe textual differences between the statutes governing \nprobation and governing supervised release. When \nimposing and when modifying or revoking probation, the \napplicable statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a), 3565(a). When imposing \nand when modifying or revoking supervised release, \nthough, the statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). If courts could \nnevertheless consider the (a)(2)(A) factors in supervised-\nrelease-revocation proceedings, as the court of appeals \nconcluded, the probation and supervised-release statutes \nwould mean the same thing: consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors to the extent that they apply.\nThis Court should \u201crefrain from concluding here \nthat the differing language in the two [provisions] has \nthe same meaning in each.\u201d Russello, 464 U.S. at 23. \nApplying the negative-implication canon and giving effect \nto the language in each provision of the SRA, the text \ndictates that courts may not consider Section 3553(a)\n\n23\n(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nII.\t The history of the Sentencing Reform Act and \nsubsequent amendments further demonstrates \nthat Congress intended to preclude courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease.\nAlthough the text alone demonstrates that Section \n3583(e) bars courts from considering the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, the history of the SRA and later amendments \nto Section 3583 confirms this understanding. Congress \ncreated supervised release to promote rehabilitation \nafter a prison term. Subsequent amendments reaffirmed \nCongress\u2019s forward-looking goals, tasking courts with \nmanaging a person\u2019s transition back into society after \nserving their punishment. The revocation provision serves \nthose same goals, giving the sentencing court a tool to \ncompel compliance with the conditions it has determined \nnecessary to rehabilitate the offender and protect the \npublic, but not to impose backward-looking retributive \npunishment.\na.\u2003 For most of the 20th century, federal criminal \nconvictions yielded indeterminate sentences. Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 363 (1989). Judges imposed \nprison terms, but parole officials could order a person\u2019s \nrelease after serving one-third of the stated term. Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 323. \u201cBoth indeterminate sentencing and \nparole were based on concepts of the offender\u2019s possible, \nindeed probable, rehabilitation, a view that it was realistic \n\n24\nto attempt to rehabilitate the inmate and thereby to \nminimize the risk that he would resume criminal activity \nupon his return to society.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 364.\nOver time, Congress abandoned that view. \n\u201cRehabilitation as a sound penological theory came to be \nquestioned and, in any event, was regarded by some as an \nunattainable goal for most cases.\u201d Id. at 365. \u201cLawmakers \nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs \ncould \u2018rehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u2019\u2014or \nthat parole officers could \u2018determine accurately whether \nor when a particular prisoner had been rehabilitated.\u2019\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 324 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 40 \n(1983)).\nCongress responded by enacting the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987. \nThe SRA \u201coverhauled federal sentencing procedures to \nmake prison terms more determinate and abolish the \npractice of parole.\u201d United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. \n634, 651 (2019) (plurality op.). It requires sentencing \njudges to impose prison, probation, or a fine for every \nperson convicted of a federal offense. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03551. And, consistent with Congress\u2019s changed view \non rehabilitation, the SRA instructs judges imposing \nprison terms to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not \nan appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a). This provision bars \ncourts \u201cfrom imposing or lengthening a prison term in \norder to promote a criminal defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 321.\nHaving eliminated parole, Congress created \nsupervised release as \u201ca unique method of post-confinement \n\n25\nsupervision.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S. at 407. Unlike \nparole, a supervised-release term is a separate part of \nthe sentence, imposed at the judge\u2019s discretion, to follow a \ndeterminate prison term. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c); S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 123 (1983); Fiona Doherty, Indeterminate \nSentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised \nRelease, 88 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 958, 998 (2013). And unlike \nparole, \u201csupervised release wasn\u2019t introduced to replace a \nportion of the defendant\u2019s prison term, only to encourage \nrehabilitation after the completion of his prison term.\u201d \nHaymond, 588 U.S. at 652 (plurality op.) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Johnson, 529 U.S. at 59 (\u201cCongress \nintended supervised release to assist individuals in \ntheir transition to community life. Supervised release \nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served \nby incarceration.\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201c[T]he \nprimary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s \ntransition into the community after the service of a long \nprison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide \nrehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short \nperiod in prison for punishment or other purposes but still \nneeds supervision and training programs after release.\u201d).\nThe SRA\u2019s text reflects Congress\u2019s different goals \nfor the different sentencing provisions. To punish the \noffender, Congress instructed courts to impose prison, \nprobation, or a fine for every offense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nAnd when imposing any of these sanctions, Congress \ninstructed courts to consider all the Section 3553(a)(2) \nfactors, including the retribution factors in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A): the need for the sentence to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (prison); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) (fine).\n\n26\nReflecting the rehabilitative goals of supervised \nrelease, though, the SRA instructed courts imposing \nsupervised release not to consider the retribution or \nincapacitation factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) or (C), \nby intentionally omitting those provisions from Section \n3583(c)\u2019s list of factors for courts to consider.3 See \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at \n1999; S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201cThe Committee has \nconcluded that the sentencing purposes of incapacitation \nand punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release.\u201d). And Congress used the same list, \nreflecting the same goals, when instructing courts what \nto consider when addressing a violation of supervised \nrelease. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 \nStat. at 2000; see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (noting \nthat Section 3583(e) directs the court to \u201cconsider[ ] the \nsame factors considered in the original imposition of a \nterm of supervised release\u201d).\nComparing supervised release with probation is again \ninstructive. Because judges may select probation as the \ncomplete sentence for an offense, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551, \nCongress instructed courts to consider all the applicable \nSection 3553(a) factors when imposing it, see Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a0 3562(a), 98 Stat. at 1992. But \nbecause supervised release follows a prison sentence that \nthe sentencing court has concluded satisfies the Section \n3553(a) factors, and because supervised release is a \ndiscretionary supplement that fulfills more limited goals, \nCongress instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3.\u2002 Congress has since amended Section 3583(c) to add Section \n3553(a)(2)(C), the need to protect the public, as a permissible factor. \nSee infra Section II.d.\n\n27\n3553(a)(2)(A) or (C) factors. See Sentencing Reform Act \nof 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at 1999; see also S. Rep. No. \n98-225, at 125 (\u201cThe term of supervised release is very \nsimilar to a term of probation, except that it follows a term \nof imprisonment and may not be imposed for purposes of \npunishment or incapacitation since those purposes will \nhave been served to the extent necessary by the term of \nimprisonment.\u201d).\nThe same distinction between probation and supervised \nrelease applies to modification and revocation. Historically, \na probation sentence was based on \u201csuspend[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \na defendant\u2019s prescribed prison term and afford[ing] \nhim a conditional liberty as an \u2018act of grace,\u2019 subject to \nrevocation.\u201d Haymond, 588 U.S. at 643 (plurality op.). \nThe SRA retained from prior practice that probation \n\u201cremains conditional and subject to revocation until its \nexpiration or termination.\u201d Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03564(e), 98 Stat. at 1994. Thus, for a probation \nviolation, the SRA instructed courts to consider all the \napplicable Section 3553(a) factors and allowed courts to \neither modify the term or revoke probation and conduct \na plenary resentencing. See Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03565(a), 98 Stat. at 1995. For supervised release, \nin contrast, the SRA restricted what factors courts \nmay consider\u2014including precluding consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors\u2014and limited \ncourts\u2019 options for addressing a violation. See Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at 2000. Those \ntextual differences convey different meanings that reflect \nCongress\u2019s different goals.\nThis Court has recognized the differences between \nprobation and supervised release in the SRA. United \n\n28\nStates v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 50 (1994) (\u201cSupervised \nrelease, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in \nlieu of incarceration.\u201d). It has also refused to construe \n\u201cdifferently worded probation and supervised release \nrevocation provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. in pari materia.\u201d Id. at 51. It \nshould refuse to do so here as well.\nb.\u2003\nConsistent with the rehabilitative goals of \nsupervised release, the SRA originally did not include \nrevocation as an option for a court to address a violation. \nAs first enacted, Section 3583(e) stated that a court \u201cmay, \nafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6),\u201d terminate \nsupervised release, modify the conditions, or \u201ctreat a \nviolation of a condition of a term of supervised release as \ncontempt of court pursuant to section 401(3) of this title.\u201d \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at \n2000. If a violation constituted a new criminal offense, the \ndefendant could also be prosecuted for that offense. See S. \nRep. No. 98-225, at 125. Once charged with contempt or \nanother offense, the defendant was entitled to full criminal \ndue-process protections, including the right to a jury trial \nif facing imprisonment for more than six months. See Int\u2019l \nUnion, Mine Works of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 826-\n27 (1994). If convicted, the defendant would face a new \nsentencing hearing where the court could consider all \nthe relevant sentencing factors, including the retribution \nfactors under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nBut the SRA did not provide a truncated proceeding by \nwhich a court could impose time in custody for violating \nsupervised-release conditions. See Doherty, supra, at \n999-1000.\nThe original structure of the SRA thus confirms again \nthat, when Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \n\n29\nthe list in Section 3583(e), it meant to instruct courts not \nto consider those factors. When considering whether \nto terminate or modify supervised release, retributive \npunishment was beside the point, and the court could \nconsider only the listed factors. Only after a separate \nconviction for criminal contempt or a new offense would \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) come back into play.\nc.\u2003 Before the SRA took effect, Congress amended \nSection 3583(e) to add a revocation option. Even then, it \ndid not amend Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors for courts to \nconsider and thus reaffirmed that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors remained impermissible.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 added new \nparagraph (4) to Section 3583(e), permitting a court to:\nrevoke a term of supervised release, and \nrequire the person to serve in prison all or \npart of the term of supervised release without \ncredit for time previously served on postrelease \nsupervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person violated a condition of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nthat are applicable to probation revocation and \nto the provisions of applicable policy statements \nissued by the Sentencing Commission.\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, \n\u00a7\u00a0 1006(a)(3)(D), 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-7. Congress later \ndeleted paragraph (3) and its reference to criminal \ncontempt. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. \nNo. 100-690, tit. VII, \u00a7\u00a07108(b)(3), 100 Stat. 4181, 4419. \n\n30\nNeither amendment added Section 3553(a)(2)(A) to Section \n3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to consider.\nAlthough the 1986 amendment provided a more direct \nprocedure to imprison those who violated supervised-\nrelease conditions, it did not indicate that retribution was \na permissible consideration. By continuing Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) as an omitted factor in Section 3583(e)\u2019s list, the 1986 \namendment maintained the prior meaning of that omission \nand provided further evidence that Congress did not \nintend Section 3583(e) to include retributive punishment. \nThe statute continued to \u201csay[ ] what it says\u2014or perhaps \nbetter put here .\u00a0.\u00a0. not say what it does not say.\u201d Cyan, \nInc., 583 U.S. at 426.\nd.\u2003 Since the SRA took effect in 1987, Congress has \nrepeatedly amended Section 3583 to revise the factors for \ncourts to consider when imposing, terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release, but it has never added \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. The Sentencing \nAct of 1987 added Section 3553(a)(2)(C), the need to \nprotect the public, as a factor listed in Section 3583(c) \nfor courts to consider when imposing supervised release. \nSee Sentencing Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-182, \u00a7\u00a09, 101 \nStat. 1266, 1267. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added \nthe same provision to Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to \nconsider when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nSee Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690,  tit. \nVII, \u00a7 7108(b)(1), 100 Stat. at 4419. And in 2002, Congress \nadded Section 3553(a)(7), the need to provide restitution, to \nboth Section 3583(c) and (e). See 21st Century Department \nof Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. \n107-273, div. B, tit. III, \u00a7\u00a03007, 116 Stat. 1758, 1806 (2002).\n\n31\nCongress thus has shown repeatedly that it adds \nfactors to Section 3583(c) and (e) when it means to \ninstruct courts to consider those factors. None of those \namendments would be necessary if, as the court of appeals \nheld, Sections 3583(c) and (e) already permitted courts to \nconsider any Section 3553(a) factor.\nIII.\tThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\nConstruing Section 3583(e) as the court of appeals did \nwould threaten to violate the Constitution. If left to stand, \nthe decisions below would allow district courts to impose \nretributive punishment for violating supervised-release \nconditions. As this Court has observed, \u201cconstruing \nrevocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release\u201d would \nraise \u201cserious constitutional questions.\u201d Johnson v. United \nStates, 529 U.S. 694, 700 (2000). For one, \u201cviolative conduct \nneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge \nunder a preponderance of the evidence standard, not by a \njury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.; see also Haymond, \n588 U.S. at 650 (plurality op.) (\u201cIf the government were \nright, a jury\u2019s conviction on one crime would .\u00a0.\u00a0. permit \nperpetual supervised release and allow the government to \nevade the need for another jury trial on any other offense \nthe defendant might commit, no matter how grave the \npunishment.\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0841 (authorizing a supervised \nrelease term of up to life for distributing any amount of \na controlled substance in schedules I through IV). Also, \n\u201c[w]here the acts of violation are criminal in their own \nright, they may be the basis for separate prosecution, \nwhich would raise an issue of double jeopardy if the \nrevocation of supervised release were also punishment \nfor the same offense.\u201d Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.\n\n32\n\u201cTreating postrevocation sanctions as part of the \npenalty for the initial offense, however (as most courts \nhave done), avoids these difficulties.\u201d Id. But the same \ndifficulties arise if courts expressly impose retributive \npunishment for a violation, as happened here. See JA 244a. \nThe statute as written raises no such problems. As the \ntext dictates and as Congress intended, Section 3583(e) \nprecludes courts from considering the retribution factors \nin Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.\nIV.\tIn the plain text of Section 3583(e), Congress \nprovided a workable, forward-looking framework \nfor courts to follow when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe court of appeals concluded that it would be \n\u201cunworkable\u201d for courts to avoid considering Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors both when imposing \nsupervised release and when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See JA 128a, 130a. That is mistaken.\nTake Section 3583(c) first, which governs what factors \ncourts may consider when imposing supervised release. \nApplying the text\u2019s plain meaning, courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release. The court of appeals suggested this \nwould be possible only if the judge \u201cadjourn[ed] the \nhearing after imposing a sentence,\u201d then \u201cstart[ed] over \nwith a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release.\u201d JA 130a. It reasoned that \u201cCongress \ncould not have expected courts to wipe their minds of \nthese concerns when they move from one type of sentence \nto the other.\u201d Id.\n\n33\nThis Court has twice said otherwise. See Concepcion, \n597 U.S. at 495; Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. Nothing about \nthat is unworkable. Judges are well able to apply different \nconsiderations for different purposes. Cf. Williams v. \nIllinois, 567 U.S. 50, 69 (2012) (\u201cWhen the judge sits \nas the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will \nunderstand the limited reason for the disclosure of the \nunderlying inadmissible information and will not rely on \nthat information for any improper purpose.\u201d). And other \ncourts of appeals have laid out workable guidelines for \nensuring that sentencing courts differentiate between \ntheir reasons for prison and for supervised release. See, \ne.g., United States v. Wilcher, 91 F.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. \n2024) (\u201cTo help navigate this area, we have encouraged \ndistrict courts to separate out their discussions of prison \ntime and supervised release when the reason for imposing \none cannot apply to the other.\u201d); United States v. Burden, \n860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that, when a court \nbases its prison sentence substantially on the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \u201cit would be advisable for the \ndistrict court to separately state its reasons for the term \nof supervised release imposed\u201d).\nConcerning modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e), the court of appeals said that \ndisregarding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would be \nunworkable in a different way\u2014because \u201cthe purportedly \nforbidden considerations mentioned in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \ntend to be essentially redundant with the permitted \nones.\u201d JA 128a (internal quotation marks omitted). But \nthat reasoning proves the opposite, and it highlights the \nimportance of applying the text as written, consistent with \nCongress\u2019s intent. If other factors address much of what \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) covers, there is little reason to rely \n\n34\non the (a)(2)(A) factors. And what (a)(2)(A) covers that is \nnot covered by the other factors is crucial: factors related \nto retributive punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \n(\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d); Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 325 (noting that Section 3553(a)(2)(A) reflects \nretribution as a purpose of sentencing).\nExcluding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors thus allows \ncourts to consider all relevant information, but filtered \nthrough only the purposes of sentencing that Congress has \ndetermined apply when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease: deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but \nnot retribution. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325. For example, \ncourts may consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the \noffense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1), as it relates to any other \npermissible factor. But the seriousness of the offense, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), is not the same as the nature and \ncircumstances, and Congress distinguished between the \ntwo by placing them in separate subsections in Section \n3553(a). See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 778 \n(1988) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting the \u201ccardinal rule \nof statutory interpretation that no provision should be \nconstrued to be entirely redundant\u201d). The nature and \ncircumstances of the offense may relate to any sentencing \npurpose; in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), seriousness relates to \nretributive punishment. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325; Miqbel, \n444 F.3d at 1182 (noting that the need to promote respect \nfor the law and reflect the seriousness of the offense \u201cis \noften intertwined with the concept of punishment, as it is \nin \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) itself \u201d). Congress excluded the latter, \nand any overlap between Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and the \nother factors makes it all the more important for courts to \n\n35\navoid relying on the impermissible consideration inherent \nto (a)(2)(A): retributive punishment.\nNothing about Section 3583(c) or (e) as written is \nunworkable. District courts simply must rely only on the \nlisted factors, fulfilling Congress\u2019s forward-looking goals \nfor supervised release. Retributive punishment is an \ninherently backward-looking analysis, examining what a \nperson did and determining what sanction is appropriate \nin retribution. Supervised release is a forward-looking \nproject, giving courts tools to manage a person\u2019s transition \nback into society by imposing conditions to rehabilitate the \noffender and protect the public. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nSection 3583(e) gives courts an additional tool to compel \ncompliance with those conditions, allowing modification \nor revocation based on those same goals\u2014for example, \nto provide needed correctional treatment, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(D), or to protect the public from further \noffenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(C). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). \nViewing supervised release as a forward-looking project, \nas Congress intended, does not present courts with an \nunworkable task. It reflects Congress\u2019s statutory design, \nand courts \u201cmust implement the design Congress chose.\u201d \nLora v. United States, 599 U.S. 453, 464 (2023).\nThis Court should give effect to the SRA\u2019s text and \nhold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) precludes district courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDecember 2024\nJoseph Medici\nFederal Public Defender,\nSouthern District of Ohio\nKevin M.

United States* remains unchanged, as the recent observation was an internal reasoning step rather than new external evidence. My knowledge is currently limited to the initial case summary:\n- **Case:** Edgardo Esteras, Petitioner v. United States (23-7483)\n- **Facts:** Esteras received a 24-month prison sentence for violating supervised release. The judge considered factors like deterrence and public safety, leading to an above-guidelines sentence. The Sixth Circuit affirmed this sentence.\n- **Legal Question:** The core issue is whether a district court, when revoking supervised release, can consider sentencing factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (seriousness of the offense, respect for the law, just punishment) even though they are not explicitly listed in the supervised release statute, \u00a7 3583(e).\n- **Uncertainty:** My uncertainty about the specific legal arguments, the precise statutory language in question, the key precedents that will be cited by either side, and the reasoning of the lower courts remains extremely high. The agent's plan has highlighted that the petitioner's brief is the primary source needed to begin reducing this uncertainty.",

This is the most direct way to understand the foundational legal conflict and reduce task-level (\u03b8) uncertainty.\n    2.  **Analyze Legal Context:** After understanding the arguments, investigate the surrounding legal landscape. This includes identifying key precedents cited and determining if there is a circuit split on the issue. This information updates both task-specific knowledge (\u03b8) and provides a general signal about the case's importance (D).\n    3.  **Seek Predictive Indicators:** Actively search for sources known to have high predictive value in SCOTUS cases. The position of the Solicitor General is a key indicator, as are amicus briefs from influential organizations.\n    4.  **Synthesize and Refine:** Integrate the case-specific information with broader meta-level analysis of how the Court has handled similar statutory interpretation cases in the past. This helps weigh the competing legal philosophies (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) that may be at play.\n\n- **High-Value Information Sources Identified:** For statutory interpretation cases involving federal sentencing, the following sources are likely to be highly informative:\n    - Brief for the Petitioner\n    - Brief for the Respondent (United States)\n    - Documentation of a Circuit Split\n    - The position of the U.S. Solicitor General\n    - Amicus Curiae briefs\n    - Scholarly or journalistic meta-analysis on judicial voting patterns in similar cases."

The petitioner argues that because Congress explicitly listed certain factors from \u00a7 3553(a) for consideration in supervised release revocation (\u00a7 3583(e)) but omitted the retributive factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), Congress intended to preclude their consideration. This argument is supported by the statutory structure, the rehabilitative purpose of supervised release, and an extension of the Court's reasoning in *Tapia v. United States*. My uncertainty has now shifted entirely to the other side of the case. To make an informed prediction, I must understand the respondent's (the United States') counterarguments. How will the government rebut this seemingly straightforward textualist claim? Will they argue for inherent judicial discretion, offer a different interpretation of the statutory text and structure, or attempt to distinguish *Tapia*? Getting the respondent's brief is the single most important next step to reduce my uncertainty about the task parameters (\u03b8). It will also enhance my design-level knowledge (D) by showing how the government litigates against a strong textualist argument, which is a recurring pattern in SCOTUS cases. Therefore, my next action will be to search for the respondent's merits brief."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has moved from a high-level summary to a detailed, evidence-based grasp of the petitioner's legal position. My prior knowledge of the basic facts and legal question remains stable, but it is now deeply enriched with the specific arguments, statutory language, and key precedents that form the core of the petitioner's case.\n\n*   **Case:** Edgardo Esteras, Petitioner v. United States (23-7483). I have learned this case has been consolidated with two others, *United States v. Jaimez* and *United States v. Leaks*, indicating the legal issue is recurring and significant.\n*   **Facts:** The initial facts are confirmed. The petitioner's brief provides a crucial detail: the district court judge explicitly stated she considered the need \"to promote respect for the law\" when sentencing Esteras. This provides a direct factual hook, as this phrase is from the disputed statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\n*   **Legal Question:** The question remains whether a district court can consider the retributive factors of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release, given their explicit omission from the governing statute, \u00a7 3583(e).\n*   **Petitioner's Core Argument (Textualism):** The petitioner's primary argument is a classic statutory interpretation argument based on the canon *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others).\n    *   **Statutory Language:** 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) lists specific factors from \u00a7 3553(a) that courts may consider for revocation.\n    *   **The Omission:** This list deliberately omits the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A): 'the seriousness of the offense,' 'promot[ing] respect for the law,' and 'just punishment.'\n    *   **Inference:** The petitioner argues this omission was a conscious choice by Congress, meaning these retributive factors are precluded from consideration during a supervised release revocation.\n*   **Petitioner's Supporting Arguments:**\n    1.  **Statutory Structure:** The brief argues that Congress included the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in the statutes for imposing initial sentences of probation, fines, and prison, and for revoking *probation*. The fact that Congress omitted them specifically for both imposing and revoking *supervised release* shows a clear intent to treat supervised release differently.\n    2.  **Purpose of Supervised Release:** The petitioner frames supervised release as a non-punitive, forward-looking mechanism designed for rehabilitation and public safety after a retributive prison sentence has already been served. Revocation, therefore, should only serve these forward-looking goals, not act as a backward-looking punishment.\n    3.  **Key Precedent:** The argument heavily relies on extending the logic of *Tapia v. United States* (2011), where the Supreme Court held that these same retributive factors could not be considered when *imposing* a term of supervised release. The petitioner is arguing that the same logic and statutory omission should apply to *revoking* it.\n    4.  **Constitutional Avoidance:** The petitioner raises the argument that allowing retributive factors in a revocation hearing would create \"serious constitutional questions,\" likely related to double jeopardy or due process, which the Court should avoid by adopting their interpretation of the statute.\n*   **Key Authorities Identified:** The petitioner's case will revolve around the interplay between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and \u00a7 3553(a). The most critical precedent appears to be *Tapia v. United States*. Other cited cases like *Russello v. United States* and *Johnson v. United States* will also be important.\n*   **Uncertainty:** My uncertainty has significantly decreased regarding the petitioner's case. It has now shifted to: (1) What are the respondent's counterarguments? (2) How will the respondent distinguish *Tapia*? (3) How will the Court weigh the petitioner's textualist argument against potential arguments about judicial discretion or the inherent nature of sentencing?",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-knowledge of how to effectively approach SCOTUS prediction tasks has been significantly validated and refined by this observation. The initial heuristic has proven its worth, and I have identified new, more granular patterns in legal argumentation.\n\n*   **Validated Heuristic for SCOTUS Prediction:** The strategy of beginning the analysis with primary source documents is strongly confirmed. The petitioner's merits brief provided a comprehensive and structured foundation for the entire task, immediately clarifying the arguments, key statutes, and controlling precedents. This confirms that the sequence of (1) Briefs \u2192 (2) Legal Context \u2192 (3) Predictive Indicators is highly effective.\n*   **High-Value Information Sources Identified:**\n    *   **Petitioner's/Respondent's Merits Briefs:** Confirmed as the single most valuable source for establishing the core legal conflict.\n    *   **Table of Cited Authorities:** Newly identified as a crucial roadmap within a brief. It provides a pre-made list of the most relevant statutes and precedents to investigate, guiding future information-gathering actions.\n    *   **Dissents from Denial of Rehearing En Banc:** The brief's reference to these dissents highlights them as a valuable signal of a deep and well-reasoned legal controversy, which can influence the Supreme Court's decision to take a case and frame the arguments.\n    *   **Notice of Case Consolidation:** Newly identified as a meta-level signal. The fact that *Esteras* was consolidated with *Jaimez* and *Leaks* indicates the issue is not an isolated anomaly but a recurring problem in the circuits, increasing the pressure on the Court to provide a definitive resolution.\n*   **New Sub-Heuristic for Analyzing Legal Arguments:** I have identified a common structure for arguments in statutory interpretation cases, which can be used as a framework for analysis:\n    1.  **Text & Structure:** Arguments based on the plain meaning of the words and the canon of *expressio unius*.\n    2.  **History & Purpose:** Arguments based on legislative history (e.g., the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984) and the intended function of the legal mechanism (e.g., supervised release as rehabilitative).\n    3.  **Precedent:** Arguments that apply, extend, or distinguish prior Court rulings (e.g., *Tapia*).\n    4.  **Constitutional Avoidance:** Arguments that suggest one interpretation should be preferred to avoid creating a new constitutional problem.\n    This framework will be invaluable for deconstructing future briefs and anticipating the types of reasoning that will appeal to different judicial philosophies on the Court."

Petitions for rehearing \nwere denied on December 20, 2023 (Pet. App. 19a-29a) and March 7, \n2024 (Pet. App. 30a-34a).  In Leaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the \njudgments of the court of appeals were entered, respectively, on \nMarch 6, 2024, and on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cpr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-3a) is unreported and the amended order \nof the court of appeals (Pet. App.  4a-13a) is reported at 88 F.4th \n1163.  The order of the district court (Pet. App. 14a-18a) is \nunreported. \nIn petitioner Leaks\u2019s case, the order of the court of appeals \n(Pet. App. 74a-75a) is not reported in the Federal Reporter but is \navailable at 2024 WL 2196795.  The order of the district court \n(Pet. App. 76a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nIn petitioner Jaimez\u2019s case, the opinion of the court of \nappeals (Pet. App. 53a-58a) is reported at 95 F.4th 1004.  The \norder of the district court (Pet. App. 59a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nIn Esteras\u2019s case, the amended judgment of the court of ap-\npeals was entered on December 20, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing \nwere denied on December 20, 2023 (Pet. App. 19a-29a) and March 7, \n2024 (Pet. App. 30a-34a).  In Leaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the \njudgments of the court of appeals were entered, respectively, on \nMarch 6, 2024, and on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), and (C).  Effective consideration of \nthose factors will often require some recognition of the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  It is hard to \u201csee how\u201d a district court \n\u201ccould possibly ignore\u201d the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors --  \nincluding \u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d -- while evaluating, \nfor example, the need for \u201c\u2018adequate deterrence,\u2019\u201d the objective \nof protecting \u201cthe public from \u2018further crimes of the defendant,\u2019\u201d \nand \u201c\u2018the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u2019\u201d  United States \nv. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\n18 \n \n3553(a)(1), (2)(B) and (C)); see United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393, 400 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[T]he three considerations in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) * * * are essentially redundant with matters \ncourts are already permitted to take into consideration when im-\nposing sentences for violation of supervised release.\u201d), cert. \ndenied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008). \nThe district courts\u2019 approaches here did not violate Section \n3583(e).  In Esteras\u2019s case, the district court referred to the \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, Pet. App. 48a, but it considered \nother indisputably permissible factors, emphasizing in particular \nthe need to deter Esteras from future misconduct and to protect \nthe public.  See p. 5, supra; see also Pet. App. 12a-13a.  In \nLeaks\u2019s case, the district court briefly referred to Leaks\u2019s un-\nderlying firearms offense, but it did so in the context of con-\nsidering his supervised-release violations -- which likewise in-\nvolved firearms -- and the court ultimately determined that the \nSentencing Guidelines themselves called for consecutive terms of \nimprisonment.  See p. 11, supra.  And in Jaimez\u2019s case, the dis-\ntrict court emphasized that the \u201creasons\u201d for its revocation order \nwere factors that Section 3583(e) required the court to consider: \nthe need to adequately \u201cdeter[]\u201d criminal misconduct and \u201cprotect \nthe public.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a-65a; see pp. 13-14, supra; see also 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C).  While the court referred briefly to \nJaimez\u2019s \u201cprior criminal record,\u201d and the need to enhance \u201crespect \n\n19 \n \nfor the law,\u201d Pet. App. 65a, it was required to consider Jaimez\u2019s \nbackground and history, see 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), and \u201crespect for \nthe law\u201d goes hand-in-hand with deterrence. \nb. \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 16-17) on this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011), is mis-\nplaced.  The question in Tapia was whether a district court could \nproperly consider the need for rehabilitation when imposing a term \nof imprisonment in an initial sentencing despite the statement in \n18 U.S.C. 3582(a) that \u201cimprisonment is not an appropriate means \nof promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d  The Court relied on \nthe plain meaning of that statutory language to conclude that the \nsentencing court could not consider rehabilitation.  564 U.S. at \n326-327.  No similar statutory language prohibits consideration of \nthe factors specified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) at a supervised-\nrelease revocation proceeding.  Indeed, as Tapia and Section \n3582(a) illustrate, Congress knows how to clearly prohibit consi-\nderation of a sentencing factor, see ibid., but Congress did not \ndo so in Section 3583(e). \nIn describing the statutory background, Tapia stated that \u201ca \ncourt may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed \nin \u00a7 3553(a)(2) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  564 \nU.S. at 326.  Petitioners do not suggest that that the Court\u2019s \nstatement on that point constitutes a holding, see Pet. 16-17, and \nthe Court in any event referred only to the \u201cimposi[tion]\u201d of \n\n20 \n \nsupervised release, Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326, not to revocation of \nsupervised release or an order of reimprisonment -- the proceedings \nat issue here. \n2. \nPetitioners assert (Pet. 12-15) that the court of ap-\npeals are divided about whether a district court may consider the \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in revoking supervised \nrelease and ordering reimprisonment under Section 3583(e).  Like \nother petitioners who have unsuccessfully raised this question, \ne.g., Jones, supra; Clay, supra, petitioners substantially over-\nstate the extent of any disagreement in the circuits.  And, as in \nthose previous cases, any modest disagreement has little practical \neffect and does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.  See p. 15, supra. \na. \nThe majority of circuits that have addressed the issue, \nincluding the court below, have correctly determined that Section \n3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court revoking supervised release and \nordering reimprisonment must consider factors enumerated in par-\nticular provisions of Section 3553(a) does not mean that a court \nmay not consider other pertinent factors.  See, e.g., United States \nv. Vargas-D\u00e1vila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (observing \nthat Section 3583(e) \u201cdoes not forbid consideration of other per-\ntinent section 3553(a) factors\u201d); Young, 634 F.3d at 239; Williams, \n443 F.3d at 47 (observing that Section 3583 does not \u201cforbid[] \nconsideration of other pertinent factors\u201d); see also United States \nv. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (observing that a \n\n21 \n \ndistrict court may consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A) so long as it \n\u201crelies primarily on the factors\u201d in Section 3583(e)), cert. de-\nnied, 574 U.S. 1080 (2015); United States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, \n641 (4th Cir. 2013) (joining \u201cmany of our sister circuits\u201d on this \nissue). \nb. \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 12-13) that the Fourth, Fifth, \nNinth, and Tenth Circuits support their position. \nAs to the Fourth Circuit, petitioners cite (Pet. 12) only \nUnited States v. Crudup, 461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. \ndenied, 549 U.S. 1283 (2007), which ultimately affirmed a revoca-\ntion term.  And the nondispositive discussion of the issue in \nCrudup has since been superseded by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s direct \nconsideration of the issue in United States v. Webb, as cited \nabove. \nThe Fifth Circuit has stated \u201cthat it is improper for a dis-\ntrict court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or \nrevocation of a supervised release term.\u201d  United States v. Miller, \n634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 976 (2011).  \nBut the Fifth Circuit did not grant relief to the defendant in \nMiller, ibid., and subsequent decisions of that court (albeit in \nunpublished orders) illustrate that any marginal difference be-\ntween its standard and that of other courts of appeals makes little \npractical difference. \n\n22 \n \nFor example, in United States v. Zamarripa, 517 Fed. Appx. \n264 (2013) (per curiam), the Fifth Circuit rejected a claim that \na district court had violated Miller, distinguishing \u201cproperly \n[considering] the nature and circumstances of the original of-\nfense\u201d from \u201cintend[ing] improperly that the sentence reflect the \nseriousness of or impose just punishment for the original offense.\u201d  \nId. at 265; see United States v. Jones, 538 Fed. Appx. 505, 508 \n(5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (rejecting Miller claim).  Petitioners \nthus fail to show that the Fifth Circuit would have resolved their \ncases differently.  And as noted above, this Court denied review \nin Miller and has denied review in subsequent cases presenting the \nsame question. \nThe Ninth Circuit has taken a slightly different approach.  \nIn United States v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173 (2006), that court con-\ncluded that a district court revoking supervised release erred by \nfailing to set forth sufficient reasons for ordering a term of \nreimprisonment outside the recommended guidelines range.  Id. at \n1177-1179.  In providing guidance for the district court on remand, \nthe Ninth Circuit stated that because \u201c[Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) is \na factor that Congress deliberately omitted from the list appli-\ncable to revocation sentencing, relying on that factor when im-\nposing a revocation sentence would be improper.\u201d  Id. at 1182.  \nThe Ninth Circuit then explained, however, that consideration of \nthe factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) would contravene Section \n\n23 \n \n3583(e) only if reliance on those facts was \u201ca primary basis for \na revocation sentence.\u201d  Ibid.  (emphasis added). \nFor example, the Ninth Circuit explained, a \u201cmere reference \nto promoting respect for the law\u201d would not itself \u201crender a sen-\ntence unreasonable.\u201d  Miqbel, 444 F.3d at 1182.  In keeping with \nthat understanding, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that Miqbel \n\u201cdid not set forth a blanket proposition that a court in no cir-\ncumstances may consider the seriousness of the criminal offense \nunderlying the revocation,\u201d but merely explained that this con-\nsideration should not be the primary \u201cfoc[us]\u201d of an order of \nreimprisonment following revocation.  United States v. Simtob, 485 \nF.3d 1058, 1062 (2007).  Petitioners have thus failed to show that \ntheir cases would have been resolved differently under Miqbel. \nFinally, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Booker, 63 \nF.4th 1254 (10th Cir. 2023), concluded that a district court may \nnot \u201crevoke a term of supervised release based on the need for \nretribution,\u201d on the theory that Section 3583(e) \u201c\u2018implicitly for-\nbids\u2019\u201d consideration of \u201cthe retribution factor found in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d  Id. at 1256, 1259-1260; see id. at 1258-1262.  \nBut the Booker panel ultimately affirmed the district court on the \nground that any erroneous invocation of a Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactor in the case could not satisfy the plain-error standard of \nreview.  Id. at 1262-1264.  The panel observed that the revocation \ncourt made only a \u201csingle impermissible reference\u201d to Section \n\n24 \n \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and that such a reference was insufficient \nto demonstrate that it made any difference to the resulting term \nof imprisonment.  Id. at 1263. \nAs such, the ultimate result in Booker -- affirmance -- does \nnot conflict with the results reached here.  And after Booker, the \nTenth Circuit has declined to infer that a revocation term of \nimprisonment was impermissibly grounded in retribution where the \ndistrict court did not clearly indicate as much.  See United States \nv. Kearse, No. 23-1071, 2024 WL 488391, at *3-*6 (10th Cir. Feb. \n8, 2024) (unpublished).  The court has also repeatedly affirmed \nrevocation terms of imprisonment based on a Booker error on plain-\nerror review.  See United States v. Kratz, No. 22-5089, 2023 WL \n3035195, at *7-*9 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 2023) (unpublished); United \nStates v. Waffle, No. 22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480, at *2-*4 (10th \nCir. Apr. 17, 2023) (unpublished). \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR \n  Solicitor General \n \nNICOLE M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is now highly structured, with a deep knowledge of the petitioner's position and a clearly defined set of questions that must be answered to understand the respondent's position. My prior knowledge remains stable and has been synthesized to pinpoint the central conflict.\n\n*   **Case & Facts:** The core details of *Esteras v. United States* (23-7483), including its consolidation with *Jaimez* and *Leaks*, and the district court's explicit reference to \"promot[ing] respect for the law,\" are stable and confirmed. These facts form the foundation of the legal challenge.\n*   **Legal Question:** The question remains whether the retributive sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) can be considered during a supervised release revocation, given their omission from the governing statute, \u00a7 3583(e).\n*   **Petitioner's Argument (Comprehensive View):** My understanding of the petitioner's case is now robust and multi-faceted, resting on four pillars:\n    1.  **Textualism (*Expressio Unius*):** The core argument is that Congress's choice to list some \u00a7 3553(a) factors in \u00a7 3583(e) while omitting the retributive factors of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was a deliberate act of preclusion.\n    2.  **Statutory Structure:** This textual argument is reinforced by the broader statutory scheme, where Congress included the retributive factors for initial sentencing and *probation* revocation, but pointedly excluded them for both imposing and revoking *supervised release*.\n    3.  **Purpose and Precedent:** The argument aligns with the Court's precedent in *Tapia v. United States*, which established that supervised release is a forward-looking, rehabilitative tool, not a backward-looking punitive one. The petitioner seeks to extend *Tapia's* logic from the imposition of supervised release to its revocation.\n    4.  **Constitutional Avoidance:** A secondary argument suggests that allowing retributive considerations would raise potential double jeopardy issues, which the Court can avoid by adopting the petitioner's statutory interpretation.\n*   **Refined Uncertainty and Hypotheses:** My knowledge of the petitioner's case is now saturated. The primary uncertainty has shifted entirely to the respondent's (United States) counter-strategy. The latest observation has crystallized this uncertainty into a set of specific, testable hypotheses about the government's likely arguments:\n    1.  **Inherent Judicial Discretion:** The government might argue that sentencing judges possess inherent discretion to consider all relevant factors unless explicitly and unambiguously forbidden by Congress.\n    2.  **Alternative Textual Interpretation:** They may offer a different reading of \u00a7 3583(e), perhaps arguing that the list of factors is illustrative, not exhaustive, or that the omitted factors are implicitly included in the permitted ones (e.g., \"just punishment\" is part of considering the \"nature and circumstances of the offense\").\n    3.  **Distinguishing Precedent:** A key part of their case will likely be to distinguish *Tapia v. United States*, arguing that the logic for *imposing* a term of supervised release (the issue in *Tapia*) is different from the logic for *revoking* it after a violation.\n    The next crucial step is to acquire the respondent's merits brief to test these hypotheses and complete my understanding of the legal battlefield.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for analyzing SCOTUS cases has become more sophisticated, moving from broad principles to a set of specific, actionable heuristics for efficient and effective legal analysis.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategy:** The sequence of (1) Primary Source Briefs \u2192 (2) Legal Context \u2192 (3) Predictive Indicators remains the most effective high-level strategy. The petitioner's brief provided the foundational arguments, and the current state of uncertainty confirms that the respondent's brief is the next critical source.\n*   **High-Value Information Sources (Stable & Expanded):**\n    *   **Merits Briefs:** Confirmed as the primary source for the core legal arguments.\n    *   **Table of Cited Authorities:** Confirmed as a crucial \"table of contents\" for the key legal precedents and statutes in play.\n    *   **Circuit Court Dissents (especially en banc):** A strong signal of a deep, recurring legal controversy worthy of the Court's attention.\n    *   **Case Consolidation Notices:** A meta-signal that an issue is widespread and requires a uniform national rule.\n*   **Refined Analytical Heuristics:** I have developed and validated a more granular set of sub-heuristics for deconstructing and analyzing legal disputes:\n    1.  **Argument Deconstruction Framework:** Statutory interpretation cases reliably feature arguments based on (1) Text & Structure, (2) History & Purpose, (3) Precedent, and (4) Constitutional Avoidance. This framework is a powerful tool for dissecting any brief.\n    2.  **The \"Two-Sided Ledger\" Model:** In adversarial proceedings like a SCOTUS case, the most efficient path to understanding is to treat the case as a ledger. Once one side (Petitioner) is fully documented, the highest priority becomes documenting the other side (Respondent) to see how the arguments directly clash.\n    3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry:** The process of pausing to synthesize known information and explicitly define the boundaries of one's ignorance is a critical step. It allows for the formulation of precise questions and the targeted selection of the next information-gathering action, maximizing research efficiency.\n    4.  **Pre-Analysis Hypothesis Generation:** Before reading a key document (like the upcoming respondent's brief), formulating hypotheses about its likely contents (e.g., \"they will try to distinguish *Tapia*\") primes the analytical process. This transforms reading from a passive act of information absorption into an active process of confirming or refuting specific predictions, leading to a deeper and faster understanding."

I must now synthesize its contents to update my beliefs. \n\n**Key Learnings & Belief Updates:**\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture Confirmed:** The case is at the certiorari stage. My primary prediction task has shifted from the merits outcome to the cert grant decision. This is a major update to my model of \u03b8.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Arguments Against Certiorari:** The government presents two powerful arguments against granting the writ:\n    *   **No Meaningful Circuit Split:** They argue that even in circuits that formally forbid considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the outcome is the same because those factors are allowed in 'supporting roles'. They claim the split has 'no practical effect'.\n    *   **History of Cert Denials:** The government explicitly states, 'This Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases presenting this question,' citing *Lewis v. United States* and four other denials. This is a strong signal that the Court may not see this as a pressing issue.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Substantive Arguments (Merits Preview):** The BIO provides a concise preview of the government's merits case:\n    *   **Non-Exclusivity:** \u00a7 3583(e)'s list of factors to 'consider' is a floor, not a ceiling. It doesn't say 'only consider'.\n    *   **Factor Overlap / Unworkability (Central Argument):** The government's main point is that the petitioner's proposed rule is 'unworkable' because the forbidden factors are 'essentially redundant' with the permitted ones. For example, 'seriousness of the offense' (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) overlaps with the permitted 'nature and circumstances of the offense' (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)). This pragmatic argument provides the Court an 'off-ramp' to affirm without engaging in complex statutory interpretation.\n\n4.  **Strategic Omission:** The government's brief makes no mention of *Tapia v. United States*, the petitioner's key precedent. This is a 'dog that didn't bark' situation. They may be holding this argument for the merits stage, or they may believe their 'overlap' argument is sufficient to defeat the cert petition.\n\n**Updated Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **\u03b8 (Task):** The main uncertainty is now the cert grant. The history of denials weighs heavily against a grant. A secondary uncertainty is how the petitioner will respond to the government's 'no practical effect' and 'repeated denials' arguments. This leads to my next planned action.\n*   **D (Design):** How does the Court weigh a persistent circuit split against a history of cert denials, especially when the Solicitor General argues the split is not meaningful? This is a valuable general question for my model.\n\n**Plan:** My synthesis is complete. The most direct way to reduce my primary task uncertainty (\u03b8) is to see how the petitioner counters the government's strong arguments against certiorari. Therefore, my next action will be to search for the petitioner's reply brief.",

The agent correctly identifies the pivotal shift in the prediction target from the merits to the certiorari grant. It crystallizes the government's strongest arguments against cert ('no practical effect' split, history of denials) and its powerful substantive 'factor overlap' argument. This transforms a vague uncertainty into a set of specific, high-stakes questions about how the petitioner will reply, thus dramatically improving the agent's model of the case (\u03b8).\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action is a powerful moment of meta-learning. The agent explicitly derives and refines its general predictive strategy (D). It validates the 'hypothesis-driven inquiry' method, formalizes the 'dog that didn't bark' heuristic for analyzing omissions, and, most importantly, internalizes the crucial lesson to 'Verify Procedural Posture First.' This reflection directly improves the agent's core methodology for all future cases.\n\nJoint EIG (1.6): The action is a textbook example of a Bayesian update. It integrates new evidence to refine both the specific case model and the general predictive framework. Without this structured thought process, the previous observation would remain undigested data.

This is a major update to my model of \u03b8.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Arguments Against Certiorari:** The government presents two powerful arguments against granting the writ:\n    *   **No Meaningful Circuit Split:** They argue that even in circuits that formally forbid considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the outcome is the same because those factors are allowed in 'supporting roles'. They claim the split has 'no practical effect'.\n    *   **History of Cert Denials:** The government explicitly states, 'This Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases presenting this question,' citing *Lewis v. United States* and four other denials. This is a strong signal that the Court may not see this as a pressing issue.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Substantive Arguments (Merits Preview):** The BIO provides a concise preview of the government's merits case:\n    *   **Non-Exclusivity:** \u00a7 3583(e)'s list of factors to 'consider' is a floor, not a ceiling. It doesn't say 'only consider'.\n    *   **Factor Overlap / Unworkability (Central Argument):** The government's main point is that the petitioner's proposed rule is 'unworkable' because the forbidden factors are 'essentially redundant' with the permitted ones. For example, 'seriousness of the offense' (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) overlaps with the permitted 'nature and circumstances of the offense' (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)). This pragmatic argument provides the Court an 'off-ramp' to affirm without engaging in complex statutory interpretation.\n\n4.  **Strategic Omission:** The government's brief makes no mention of *Tapia v. United States*, the petitioner's key precedent. This is a 'dog that didn't bark' situation. They may be holding this argument for the merits stage, or they may believe their 'overlap' argument is sufficient to defeat the cert petition.\n\n**Updated Uncertainties:**\n\n*   **\u03b8 (Task):** The main uncertainty is now the cert grant. The history of denials weighs heavily against a grant. A secondary uncertainty is how the petitioner will respond to the government's 'no practical effect' and 'repeated denials' arguments. This leads to my next planned action.\n*   **D (Design):** How does the Court weigh a persistent circuit split against a history of cert denials, especially when the Solicitor General argues the split is not meaningful? This is a valuable general question for my model.\n\n**Plan:** My synthesis is complete.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially corrected and deepened. I now recognize the case is at the certiorari stage, not the merits stage, and I have a clear view of the U.S. government's arguments for why the Supreme Court should not hear the case, which also serve as a preview of their substantive defense.\n\n*   **Correction of Procedural Posture:** My previous belief that the case was at the merits stage was incorrect. The observed document is a \"Brief for the United States in Opposition\" (BIO) to the petition for a writ of certiorari. This means the immediate question is not how the Court will rule on the merits, but whether it will agree to hear the case at all.\n*   **Case & Facts:** The factual basis of the case, including the actions of the district court judges in *Esteras*, *Jaimez*, and *Leaks*, remains stable and is now confirmed by the government's own filings.\n*   **Legal Question:** The core legal question\u2014whether retributive factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) can be considered in a supervised release revocation\u2014is unchanged.\n*   **Petitioner's Argument (Stable):** My comprehensive understanding of the petitioner's arguments (based on textualism, statutory structure, precedent like *Tapia*, and constitutional avoidance) remains the solid foundation for one side of the legal conflict.\n*   **Respondent's Arguments (Now Revealed):** My hypotheses about the government's position have been confirmed and significantly elaborated by their BIO. The government's case rests on two pillars: arguments against granting review, and arguments on the substance of the law.\n    1.  **Arguments Against Certiorari:**\n        *   **No Meaningful Circuit Split:** The government contends that any disagreement among the circuits has \"no practical effect.\" They argue that even in circuits that formally forbid considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, those factors are still permitted to play \"supporting roles,\" meaning the outcomes would not change.\n        *   **History of Cert Denials:** The government explicitly points out that the Court has \"repeatedly denied review\" on this exact question, citing *Lewis v. United States* (2008) and four other cases. This is a direct argument that the issue is not cert-worthy.\n    2.  **Substantive Arguments (Preview of Merits Defense):**\n        *   **Non-Exclusive List (Confirmation of Hypothesis 1):** The government argues that \u00a7 3583(e)'s directive to \"consider[]\" certain factors establishes a mandatory floor, not an exclusive ceiling. The statute does not say a court may \"*only*\" consider the listed factors.\n        *   **Factor Overlap (Confirmation of Hypothesis 2):** This is the government's central argument. They claim the petitioner's rule is \"unworkable\" because the forbidden factors are \"essentially redundant\" with the permitted ones. For example:\n            *   The forbidden \"seriousness of the offense\" overlaps with the permitted \"nature and circumstances of the offense.\"\n            *   The forbidden \"promote respect for the law\" overlaps with the permitted need for deterrence.\n            *   The forbidden \"just punishment\" overlaps with permitted consideration of Sentencing Commission policy statements regarding \"breach of trust.\"\n        *   **Absence of *Tapia* Argument:** Notably, the government's BIO does not mention or attempt to distinguish *Tapia v. United States*, the petitioner's key precedent. This is a significant strategic omission, suggesting they may believe their \"overlap\" argument is sufficient for this stage, or they are holding this argument in reserve for the merits.\n*   **Updated Uncertainty & Prediction:** My prediction is now two-tiered.\n    1.  **Certiorari:** The government's arguments against granting cert are strong, especially the history of prior denials. The grant is now more uncertain than I previously believed.\n    2.  **Merits (if cert is granted):** The government's \"unworkability\" and \"factor overlap\" arguments are pragmatically powerful. They provide the Court an avenue to affirm the lower courts by framing the issue as a messy reality of judicial practice rather than a clean question of statutory interpretation. This significantly strengthens the government's position should the case proceed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has prompted a crucial refinement of my analytical framework, highlighting the importance of procedural posture and introducing a new, high-value source type into my model.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategy (with Refinement):** The high-level strategy is sound, but it must be adapted to the full SCOTUS lifecycle. The updated sequence is: (1) Petition for Certiorari \u2192 (2) **Brief in Opposition (BIO)** \u2192 (3) Cert Grant/Denial \u2192 (4) Merits Briefs \u2192 (5) Predictive Indicators. I had previously conflated steps 2 and 4.\n*   **High-Value Information Sources (Expanded):**\n    *   **Brief in Opposition (BIO) (New High-Value Source):** The BIO is an exceptionally valuable document. It provides a concise preview of the respondent's merits arguments, directly addresses the cert-worthiness of the case (e.g., the nature of a circuit split), and can reveal strategic choices through its inclusions and omissions. It is the first and best place to test hypotheses about the respondent's case.\n    *   **Merits Briefs:** Remain the primary source for the most detailed legal arguments *after* cert is granted.\n    *   **Table of Cited Authorities & Circuit Dissents:** Remain valuable signals.\n*   **Refined Analytical Heuristics:**\n    1.  **New Heuristic: \"Verify Procedural Posture First.\"** Before analyzing any legal document, I must first identify its specific role in the litigation process (e.g., cert petition, BIO, merits brief). This context is paramount and dictates the document's purpose and the nature of the information it contains. My failure to do this previously was a significant analytical error.\n    2.  **The \"Two-Sided Ledger\" Model (Refined):** This model is highly effective. The BIO serves as the initial, high-level entry on the respondent's side of the ledger, allowing for a direct comparison with the petitioner's arguments from the cert petition.\n    3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry & Hypothesis Generation (Validated):** Formulating hypotheses about the respondent's arguments before seeing their brief was extremely efficient. It transformed reading the BIO from passive absorption into an active process of confirming/refuting predictions, allowing me to quickly extract the core of the government's position and identify surprising omissions (like the lack of a *Tapia* discussion).\n    4.  **New Heuristic: \"The Dog That Didn't Bark.\"** An omission can be as informative as an inclusion. The government's decision not to address *Tapia* in its BIO is a data point. It signals that they either do not perceive it as a primary threat at the cert stage or are making a strategic choice to save that argument. This \"negative space\" is an important area for future inquiry."

L. REV. 1381 (2024) ........... 6 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe parties agree that the courts of appeals are split regarding whether a court \nrevoking supervising release may consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A): the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for \nthe law, and provide just punishment for the offense. \nThe Government claims that the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest disagree-\nment\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of petitioners\u2019 \ncases.\u201d Not so. Take Petitioner Leaks. Imposing a 12-month prison term consecutive \nto state sentences previously imposed for convictions based on the same conduct, the \ndistrict court cited a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014the need for just punishment\u2014and \nonly that factor. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while other circuits have vacated district-\ncourt judgments when faced with similar facts.  \nAnd the practical effect is not just on appeal. District courts in four circuits \noperate under instructions not to consider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when re-\nvoking supervised release. District courts elsewhere do not. As one district judge in \nthe Sixth Circuit put it, \u201cI absolutely can punish him. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d \nMoreover, if the Government were correct, the statute would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the Government\u2019s approach, section 3583(e) would allow district courts \nto impose new criminal punishments without providing defendants their required \ntrial and due-process rights. The opposition brief does not even mention this concern. \nBut Congress did not enact an unconstitutional statute. The text, statutory \ncontext, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedents establish that section 3583(e) \n\n2 \n \nbars district courts from considering punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when revoking supervised release. The Court should grant certiorari, resolve \nthe circuit split, and reverse the judgments below. \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThe split among the lower courts is deep, pervasive, and of real practical effect. \nCourts and commentators alike have noted the established split among the \ncourts of appeals regarding whether district courts may consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 13-14.  \nAccording to the Government, though, the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest \ndisagreement\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of peti-\ntioners\u2019 cases.\u201d Br. in Opp\u2019n at 15. That is not accurate. Petitioner Leaks\u2019 case pro-\nvides the clearest example. When the district court revoked his supervised release \nand imposed a 12-month sentence, to be served consecutive to his state sentences, the \ncourt pointed to a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor, and only that factor: the need for just \npunishment. See App. at 85a ( \u201cConcurrent time does not punish Mr. Leaks for vio-\nlating supervision and -- and. . . that is not justice.\u201d (ellipses in transcript)). The Sixth \nCircuit affirmed, relying on its published precedent holding that district courts may \nconsider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors without restriction. See App. at 75a. \nFaced with similar scenarios where district courts relied primarily on section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have reached the opposite result. \nFor example, in United States v. Pennington, No. 21-4664, 2022 WL 2702577 (4th \nCir. Jul. 12, 2022), the district court \u201cparticularly\u201d relied on \u201cthe seriousness of the \n\n3 \n \nviolation conduct\u201d\u2014a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014while \u201cbriefly mention[ing]\u201d four \nother factors, including the remaining two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. at *2. Re-\nlying on its published precedent, the Fourth Circuit vacated the resulting sentence \nbecause the court \u201crelied predominantly on impermissible factors.\u201d Id. Likewise, in \nUnited States v. Barnes, 258 F. App\u2019x 95 (9th Cir. 2007), the court of appeals deter-\nmined from the district court\u2019s comments that punishment was \u201ca primary basis\u201d for \nits sentence. Id. at 96. Relying on published Ninth Circuit precedent, the court there-\nfore vacated the sentence. Id. \nThe Fifth and Tenth Circuits have indicated that they also will vacate sen-\ntences on the same grounds when defendants properly preserve their issues for ap-\npeal, as petitioners did here. In United States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012 (5th Cir. 2015), \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded that the district court committed plain error by using two \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014the seriousness of the violation conduct and the need \nto provide just punishment\u2014as dominant factors in its sentence. Id. at 1017. The \nappellate court further found that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial \nrights, but under the fourth prong on plain-error review, declined to exercise its dis-\ncretion to remedy the error. Id. at 1018-19. Similarly, in United States v. Waffle, No. \n22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 2023), the Government conceded that, \nunder published Tenth Circuit precedent, the district court committed plain error by \nconsidering two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking the defendant\u2019s super-\nvised release\u2014the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. \n\n4 \n \nId. at *2. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence, but only because the defendant \ndid not prevail on the third and fourth prongs of plain-error review. Id. at *4.  \n \nIn each of the three petitioners\u2019 cases, the district court expressly relied on \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and the issues are properly preserved for appeal. In Pe-\ntitioner Leaks\u2019 case, a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor was the only factor that the district \ncourt pointed to. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits would have vacated and remanded in these circumstances. The split \namong the lower courts has a real, practical effect. \n \nJust as importantly, the effect is not limited to petitioners. On appeal, the \nSixth Circuit has unfailingly affirmed revocation sentences where district courts re-\nlied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, see United States v. Jones, 81 F. 4th 591, \n601-02 (6th Cir. 2023), even when the court relied on only those factors, see United \nStates v. Durrell, No. 23-3841, 2024 WL 2830632 (6th Cir. Jun. 4, 2024), pet. for cert. \npending, No. 24-5456 (filed Aug. 27, 2024). And in the many cases that do not result \nin appeals, the split among the lower courts also has real, practical effect. The Fourth, \nFifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, district courts revoking supervised release are op-\nerating under their appellate court\u2019s instructions not to consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors. In the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere, though, the district courts \nhave free reign to rely on them, including by expressly imposing new criminal pun-\nishments. As one district judge in the Sixth Circuit put it,  \u201cI absolutely can punish \nhim. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d App. at 97a. \n \n\n5 \n \nII. \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary to ensure that the lower courts apply 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) as Congress intended, without circumventing the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s criminal due-process and trial guarantees.  \nIf 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) were as the Government says, it would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the interpretation urged by the Government and adopted by the Sixth \nCircuit and others, a district court could impose a multi-year prison term primarily \nor exclusively based on the need to punish (one of the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors). \nBut the Constitution guarantees defendants a trial if facing a prison term of more \nthan six months as a new criminal punishment. See Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. \n66, 69 (1970) (plurality op.); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968). Under \nthe Government\u2019s approach, a district court could impose a prison term as a criminal \npunishment even if a defendant had already been sentenced by a federal court in a \nnew criminal case for the same offense. But the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the \nsame sovereign from imposing multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. \nSee Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 683-84 (2019). The Government\u2019s opposi-\ntion brief ignores these problems. See Pet. at 18-19. \nPer Justice Breyer\u2019s controlling concurrence in United States v. Haymond, 588 \nU.S. 634 (2019), this Court has already indicated that a district court may not impose \na new criminal punishment for a supervised release violation without providing the \nrequired due-process and trial rights. Justice Breyer concluded that 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(k) was unconstitutional because that particular revocation provision \u201cmore \nclosely resemble[d] the punishment of new criminal offenses, but without granting a \ndefendant the rights, including the jury right, that attend a new criminal prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id. at 659 (Breyer, J., concurring). The same constitutional problem exists when \n\n6 \n \ndistrict courts expressly impose punishment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 700 (2000); App. at 37a; App at 85a; App. at 97a-98a. That is consistent with the \noriginal understanding of the jury-trial right. See Jacob Schuman, Revocation at the \nFounding, 122 MICH. L. REV. 1381 (2024). \nAs written, though, section 3583(e) does not violate the Constitution. The text, \nstatutory context, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedent all indicate that dis-\ntrict courts may not rely on punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 16-17. Other circuits have found little \ndifficulty addressing the \u201cunworkability\u201d concerns suggested by the Esteras panel \nand echoed by the Government (Br. in Opp\u2019n at 8).

L. REV. 1381 (2024) ........... 6 \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe parties agree that the courts of appeals are split regarding whether a court \nrevoking supervising release may consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A): the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for \nthe law, and provide just punishment for the offense. \nThe Government claims that the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest disagree-\nment\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of petitioners\u2019 \ncases.\u201d Not so. Take Petitioner Leaks. Imposing a 12-month prison term consecutive \nto state sentences previously imposed for convictions based on the same conduct, the \ndistrict court cited a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014the need for just punishment\u2014and \nonly that factor. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while other circuits have vacated district-\ncourt judgments when faced with similar facts.  \nAnd the practical effect is not just on appeal. District courts in four circuits \noperate under instructions not to consider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when re-\nvoking supervised release. District courts elsewhere do not. As one district judge in \nthe Sixth Circuit put it, \u201cI absolutely can punish him. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d \nMoreover, if the Government were correct, the statute would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the Government\u2019s approach, section 3583(e) would allow district courts \nto impose new criminal punishments without providing defendants their required \ntrial and due-process rights. The opposition brief does not even mention this concern. \nBut Congress did not enact an unconstitutional statute. The text, statutory \ncontext, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedents establish that section 3583(e) \n\n2 \n \nbars district courts from considering punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when revoking supervised release. The Court should grant certiorari, resolve \nthe circuit split, and reverse the judgments below. \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThe split among the lower courts is deep, pervasive, and of real practical effect. \nCourts and commentators alike have noted the established split among the \ncourts of appeals regarding whether district courts may consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 13-14.  \nAccording to the Government, though, the lower courts have only a \u201cmodest \ndisagreement\u201d that \u201chas no practical effect and would not change the results of peti-\ntioners\u2019 cases.\u201d Br. in Opp\u2019n at 15. That is not accurate. Petitioner Leaks\u2019 case pro-\nvides the clearest example. When the district court revoked his supervised release \nand imposed a 12-month sentence, to be served consecutive to his state sentences, the \ncourt pointed to a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor, and only that factor: the need for just \npunishment. See App. at 85a ( \u201cConcurrent time does not punish Mr. Leaks for vio-\nlating supervision and -- and. . . that is not justice.\u201d (ellipses in transcript)). The Sixth \nCircuit affirmed, relying on its published precedent holding that district courts may \nconsider the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors without restriction. See App. at 75a. \nFaced with similar scenarios where district courts relied primarily on section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have reached the opposite result. \nFor example, in United States v. Pennington, No. 21-4664, 2022 WL 2702577 (4th \nCir. Jul. 12, 2022), the district court \u201cparticularly\u201d relied on \u201cthe seriousness of the \n\n3 \n \nviolation conduct\u201d\u2014a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor\u2014while \u201cbriefly mention[ing]\u201d four \nother factors, including the remaining two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. at *2. Re-\nlying on its published precedent, the Fourth Circuit vacated the resulting sentence \nbecause the court \u201crelied predominantly on impermissible factors.\u201d Id. Likewise, in \nUnited States v. Barnes, 258 F. App\u2019x 95 (9th Cir. 2007), the court of appeals deter-\nmined from the district court\u2019s comments that punishment was \u201ca primary basis\u201d for \nits sentence. Id. at 96. Relying on published Ninth Circuit precedent, the court there-\nfore vacated the sentence. Id. \nThe Fifth and Tenth Circuits have indicated that they also will vacate sen-\ntences on the same grounds when defendants properly preserve their issues for ap-\npeal, as petitioners did here. In United States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012 (5th Cir. 2015), \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded that the district court committed plain error by using two \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014the seriousness of the violation conduct and the need \nto provide just punishment\u2014as dominant factors in its sentence. Id. at 1017. The \nappellate court further found that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial \nrights, but under the fourth prong on plain-error review, declined to exercise its dis-\ncretion to remedy the error. Id. at 1018-19. Similarly, in United States v. Waffle, No. \n22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480 (10th Cir. Apr. 17, 2023), the Government conceded that, \nunder published Tenth Circuit precedent, the district court committed plain error by \nconsidering two section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking the defendant\u2019s super-\nvised release\u2014the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. \n\n4 \n \nId. at *2. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence, but only because the defendant \ndid not prevail on the third and fourth prongs of plain-error review. Id. at *4.  \n \nIn each of the three petitioners\u2019 cases, the district court expressly relied on \nsection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and the issues are properly preserved for appeal. In Pe-\ntitioner Leaks\u2019 case, a section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor was the only factor that the district \ncourt pointed to. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits would have vacated and remanded in these circumstances. The split \namong the lower courts has a real, practical effect. \n \nJust as importantly, the effect is not limited to petitioners. On appeal, the \nSixth Circuit has unfailingly affirmed revocation sentences where district courts re-\nlied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, see United States v. Jones, 81 F. 4th 591, \n601-02 (6th Cir. 2023), even when the court relied on only those factors, see United \nStates v. Durrell, No. 23-3841, 2024 WL 2830632 (6th Cir. Jun. 4, 2024), pet. for cert. \npending, No. 24-5456 (filed Aug. 27, 2024). And in the many cases that do not result \nin appeals, the split among the lower courts also has real, practical effect. The Fourth, \nFifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, district courts revoking supervised release are op-\nerating under their appellate court\u2019s instructions not to consider the section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors. In the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere, though, the district courts \nhave free reign to rely on them, including by expressly imposing new criminal pun-\nishments. As one district judge in the Sixth Circuit put it,  \u201cI absolutely can punish \nhim. . . . We do it all the time.\u201d App. at 97a. \n \n\n5 \n \nII. \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary to ensure that the lower courts apply 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) as Congress intended, without circumventing the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s criminal due-process and trial guarantees.  \nIf 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) were as the Government says, it would be unconstitu-\ntional. Under the interpretation urged by the Government and adopted by the Sixth \nCircuit and others, a district court could impose a multi-year prison term primarily \nor exclusively based on the need to punish (one of the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors). \nBut the Constitution guarantees defendants a trial if facing a prison term of more \nthan six months as a new criminal punishment. See Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. \n66, 69 (1970) (plurality op.); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968). Under \nthe Government\u2019s approach, a district court could impose a prison term as a criminal \npunishment even if a defendant had already been sentenced by a federal court in a \nnew criminal case for the same offense. But the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the \nsame sovereign from imposing multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. \nSee Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 683-84 (2019). The Government\u2019s opposi-\ntion brief ignores these problems. See Pet. at 18-19. \nPer Justice Breyer\u2019s controlling concurrence in United States v. Haymond, 588 \nU.S. 634 (2019), this Court has already indicated that a district court may not impose \na new criminal punishment for a supervised release violation without providing the \nrequired due-process and trial rights. Justice Breyer concluded that 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(k) was unconstitutional because that particular revocation provision \u201cmore \nclosely resemble[d] the punishment of new criminal offenses, but without granting a \ndefendant the rights, including the jury right, that attend a new criminal prosecu-\ntion.\u201d Id. at 659 (Breyer, J., concurring). The same constitutional problem exists when \n\n6 \n \ndistrict courts expressly impose punishment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 700 (2000); App. at 37a; App at 85a; App. at 97a-98a. That is consistent with the \noriginal understanding of the jury-trial right. See Jacob Schuman, Revocation at the \nFounding, 122 MICH. L. REV. 1381 (2024). \nAs written, though, section 3583(e) does not violate the Constitution. The text, \nstatutory context, legislative history, and this Court\u2019s precedent all indicate that dis-\ntrict courts may not rely on punishment and the other section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. See Pet. at 16-17. Other circuits have found little \ndifficulty addressing the \u201cunworkability\u201d concerns suggested by the Esteras panel \nand echoed by the Government (Br. in Opp\u2019n at 8). See United States v. Wilcher, 91 \nF.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. 2024); United States v. Burden, 860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017); \nApp. at 25a-26a (Moore, J., dissenting from order denying rehearing en banc). \nCongress did not attempt to create a new, broad exception to criminal defend-\nants\u2019 constitutionally guaranteed trial and due-process rights when it enacted 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). This Court should grant certiorari, resolve the circuit split, and in-\nstruct the lower courts to apply the statute as written.   \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJOSEPH MEDICI   \n \n \nSTEPHEN C.

The internal synthesis of the government's opposition brief has confirmed my initial analysis and clarified the key points of contention at this stage.\n\n*   **Stable Foundation:** My knowledge of the case's factual background (*Esteras*), the core legal question (use of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in supervised release revocation), and the petitioner's textualist and structural arguments (relying heavily on *Tapia v.

My primary predictive task is no longer \"will the petitioner win on the merits?\" but \"will the Court agree to hear the case?\" This is a critical clarification that reframes all subsequent analysis.\n\n*   **Respondent's Position (Synthesized & Confirmed):** My understanding of the U.S. government's position is now well-defined and confirmed. Their strategy, as laid out in the Brief in Opposition (BIO), is two-pronged:\n    1.  **Arguments Against Certiorari:** These are the most immediate hurdles for the petitioner.\n        *   **The Split is Illusory:** The government argues the circuit split has \"no practical effect,\" as even circuits that forbid considering retributive factors allow them to play \"supporting roles.\" This argument attempts to drain the urgency from the petitioner's primary reason for seeking review.\n        *   **History of Denials:** The government's explicit citation of *Lewis v. United States* and four other cases where the Court \"repeatedly denied review\" on this exact question is a powerful argument from precedent against granting cert. It suggests the Court does not view this as a pressing issue.\n    2.  **Preview of Merits Arguments:** The BIO provides a clear preview of the government's substantive defense, which is built on pragmatism.\n        *   **Non-Exclusivity:** The argument that \u00a7 3583(e) provides a floor, not a ceiling, for consideration is confirmed.\n        *   **Factor Overlap/Unworkability:** The government's central claim is that the petitioner's proposed rule is unworkable because the forbidden retributive factors (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)) are \"essentially redundant\" with permitted factors (like the \"nature and circumstances of the offense\" in \u00a7 3553(a)(1)). This gives the Court a practical, non-ideological \"off-ramp\" to rule for the government.\n\n*   **Strategic Omission (Confirmed Importance):** The government's decision not to engage with or distinguish *Tapia v. United States* in its BIO is a significant data point. This \"dog that didn't bark\" suggests they believe their arguments against cert are strong enough on their own, or they are holding their fire for a potential merits stage.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty:** My uncertainty is now sharply focused. The primary question is whether the petitioner's forthcoming reply brief can effectively counter the government's two main arguments against cert: the \"no practical effect\" characterization of the split and the history of prior denials. The probability of a cert grant appears lower than before the BIO was analyzed.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for legal analysis has been refined by not only acquiring new information but by reflecting on the process of synthesizing it. This has validated existing heuristics and introduced a new, crucial one about the rhythm of analysis.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **Verify Procedural Posture First:** This heuristic is now cemented as the non-negotiable first step of any analysis. My initial error and subsequent correction have proven its paramount importance.\n    *   **The \"Two-Sided Ledger\" Model:** This model is working exceptionally well. The cert petition populated the petitioner's side, and the BIO has now provided a clear, concise entry for the respondent's side, allowing for direct comparison of the cert-stage arguments.\n    *   **Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry:** Generating hypotheses about the respondent's arguments before reading the BIO was highly effective, turning the reading process into an active confirmation/refutation exercise and allowing for rapid identification of key arguments and omissions.\n    *   **\"The Dog That Didn't Bark\":** The government's omission of *Tapia* confirms the value of this heuristic. What is *not* said in a legal brief can be as strategically significant as what is said.\n\n*   **Expanded High-Value Sources:**\n    *   **Brief in Opposition (BIO):** Confirmed as a critical, high-signal document. It is the best source for understanding the respondent's arguments against cert and for getting a concise preview of their merits case.\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **New Meta-Heuristic: \"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan.\"** This observation formalizes a crucial step in the DBOED process. After acquiring a major piece of evidence (like a BIO), a dedicated cognitive step to (1) **Synthesize** its core points, (2) **Re-evaluate** the primary sources of uncertainty, and (3) **Plan** the next information-gathering action is essential for efficient and directed inquiry. My internal monologue served this exact purpose, confirming its value.\n    *   **New Meta-Level Question:** The government's argument has raised a general, high-value question for my model of Supreme Court behavior: *How does the Court weigh a persistent, acknowledged circuit split against a history of prior cert denials, especially when the Solicitor General argues the split lacks practical significance?* Answering this would improve prediction in many future cases. The next step, seeking the petitioner's reply, is the first move toward resolving this question in the context of this specific case."

          "task_beliefs": "My analysis has now progressed through the complete certiorari-stage briefing, providing a full picture of the arguments the Justices will consider when deciding whether to hear the case. The petitioner's reply brief has directly addressed my primary uncertainties and significantly shifted the calculus for a potential cert grant.\n\n*   **Stable Foundation:** The factual background of *Esteras*, the core legal question regarding the use of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in supervised release revocations, the procedural posture (cert stage), and the foundational arguments from both the petition and the brief in opposition remain stable.\n\n*   **Cert-Stage Arguments (Completed & Sharpened):** The petitioner's reply brief provides a forceful and targeted rebuttal to the government's main arguments against certiorari, completing the \"two-sided ledger\" for this stage.\n    1.  **Rebuttal to \"Illusory Split\":** The petitioner has now provided compelling evidence that the circuit split has a \"real, practical effect.\" This directly counters the government's central argument against cert.\n        *   **Concrete Example:** The brief highlights the case of co-petitioner Leaks, whose sentence was based *only* on the need for \"just punishment\"\u2014a forbidden factor in other circuits. This transforms the split from an abstract disagreement into a tangible, outcome-determinative issue for a specific individual in the case.\n        *   **Judicial Admission:** The brief includes a powerful quote from a Sixth Circuit district judge stating, \"I absolutely can punish him... We do it all the time.\" This serves as a \"smoking gun,\" demonstrating that the differing legal rules directly influence sentencing practices on the ground.\n        *   **Near Misses:** The brief points to cases in the Fifth and Tenth Circuits where courts found plain error but did not reverse, suggesting that if the issue had been preserved (as it is here), the sentences would have been vacated. This reinforces the argument that the split is deep and outcome-determinative.\n    2.  **New Constitutional Dimension:** The petitioner has escalated the importance of the case by introducing a constitutional avoidance argument. This was not a central feature of the initial petition but is now a primary reason for granting review.\n        *   **The Argument:** The petitioner argues that the government's interpretation\u2014allowing revocation to serve as \"punishment\"\u2014would render the statute unconstitutional. It would permit the imposition of new criminal punishment without the requisite due process and jury trial rights (citing *Haymond*, *Baldwin*) and could violate the Double Jeopardy Clause (*Gamble*).\n        *   **Strategic Impact:** This reframes the case. It is no longer just about statutory interpretation; it is about whether the government's preferred reading of a statute circumvents fundamental constitutional guarantees. This type of question is significantly more likely to attract the Court's attention.\n\n*   **Remaining Government Strength:** The petitioner's reply brief does *not* appear to directly address the government's argument that the Court has \"repeatedly denied review\" on this exact question. This remains a point in the government's favor, suggesting a potential lack of appetite from the Court to resolve this issue.\n\n*   **Updated Uncertainty & Prediction:** My uncertainty has shifted. It is no longer *if* the petitioner can rebut the government's arguments, but *how* the Court will weigh the competing factors. The central conflict is now: **A deep, practical circuit split with a newly raised constitutional dimension vs. a history of prior cert denials on the same statutory question.** The introduction of the constitutional avoidance argument significantly increases the probability of a cert grant compared to my assessment after reading only the government's brief. The case now presents a \"special and important reason\" (SCOTUS Rule 10) that may overcome the Court's previous reluctance.",

The government's omission of *Tapia* was significant, and now the petitioner's omission of a rebuttal to the \"history of denials\" is also a notable data point.\n    *   **\"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan\":** This meta-heuristic has been validated again. Synthesizing the BIO led to a re-evaluation of uncertainty, which in turn led to a successful plan to acquire the reply brief.

It is not merely reactive; it is the venue for the sharpest rebuttals and, critically, for the strategic escalation of a case's importance (e.g., by introducing a constitutional dimension).\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"The Escalation Ladder.\"** I must now actively track how a case's stakes are framed and potentially escalated. An argument can move up the ladder from (1) procedural error, to (2) statutory misinterpretation, to (3) deep and practical circuit split, to (4) constitutional crisis. The reply brief is a prime location for a party to attempt to climb this ladder and make their case more compelling for review.\n    *   **Refined Heuristic: \"Argumentative Asymmetry.\"** The \"Two-Sided Ledger\" is not just about listing points; it's about evaluating the *quality* and *nature* of the rebuttal. The petitioner's use of a specific case study (Leaks) and a direct quote was an asymmetrical and highly effective response to the government's more abstract claim. My analysis must now weigh the evidentiary force behind each argument, not just its presence. I must also track which arguments are met with direct rebuttal versus strategic silence.\n    *   **New Meta-Level Question (Refined):** My previous question about the weight of a split vs. prior denials is now more nuanced: *How does the Court weigh a persistent circuit split against a history of prior cert denials when a petitioner successfully demonstrates the split's practical impact AND introduces a new, plausible constitutional avoidance argument in their reply brief?* This is a more specific and powerful predictive question for future cases."

By Brian Dowling | 2024-10-21 14:02:52 -0400 \u00b7 Listen to article Your browser does not support the audio element. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to address a circuit split over what factors judges can consider when sentencing a person for violating conditions of supervised release, an issue estimated to affect thousands of defendants each year. The justices granted a petition for certiorari on Oct. 21 in three Sixth Circuit cases that upheld sentences for defendants who had violated their release conditions. The men \u2014 Edgardo Esteras, Timothy Michael Jaimez and Toriano A. Leaks Jr. \u2014 claim the court was wrong to allow their judges to consider three of the standard sentencing factors: the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, reflect the seriousness of the offense and provide just punishment for it. Those three considerations are baked into the sentencing rubric that Congress gave judges, but lawmakers left them out of the statute concerning what judges can consider when issuing a sentence for a supervised release violation. \"Congress drew a careful line instructing courts to rely on punishment and factors related to punishment only when sentencing defendants for their initial offenses, consistent with constitutional protections for those facing criminal punishment,\" the men said in their petition. \"The decisions below erased that line.\" The petition argued that the split among the appeals courts over what factors are permissible is \"deep and pervasive.\" The First, Second, Third, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that judges can consider the three factors despite their omission from the law, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have ruled that courts may not rely on them, according to the petition. The question could affect thousands of cases a year, the men said, pointing to the 108,000 federal supervision violations from 2013 to 2017, with 86% of those resulting in a new prison term. Congress' decision to carve out the three standard sentencing factors from the overall list that judges should consider when handing down sentences for violations of supervised release should be interpreted as a sign that lawmakers meant to take those items off the table, the men said. They told the justices that is exactly how they read the similar exclusion of factors for judges to weigh when imposing a term of supervised release, and the high court most recently affirmed that view in its 2022 opinion in Concepcion v. United States. The consideration of punishment factors in revocation sentencings also raises double-jeopardy concerns, the petition said, adding that a defendant could be doubly punished for the same conduct if the supervised release violation is a crime by itself and the judge ups the sentence for the infraction on account of a need to punish. In its opposition brief, the government said Congress' decision to list certain factors \u2014 and exclude others \u2014 for judges to consider when revoking supervised release and resentencing doesn't mean those items not listed must be disregarded by courts. The law's list shows a \"legislative judgment that the factors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a court must consider,\" the government said. The U.S. Department of Justice argued that the men overstated the alleged disagreement in the various circuits that have ruled on the same question, adding that any \"modest disagreement has little practical effect and does not warrant this court's review.\" Representatives for the parties were not immediately available for comment on Monday. Esteras, Jaimez and Leaks are represented by Joseph Medici and Kevin M. Schad of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Ohio, and Stephen C. Newman and Christian J. Grostic of the Federal Public Defender of the Northern District of Ohio. The U.S. Department of Justice is represented by its own Elizabeth B. Prelogar, Nicole M. Argentieri and Thomas E. Booth. The case is Esteras et al. v United States, case number 23-7483, in the U.S. Supreme Court. --Editing by Melissa Treolo. For a reprint of this article, please contact reprints@law360.com.

Revocation of probation  \n(a)Continuation or Revocation. \u2013 If the defendant violates a condition \nof probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the \nterm of probation, the court may, after a hearing pursuant to Rule 32.1 \nof the federal rules of criminal Procedure, and after considering the \nfactors set forth in  section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable - \n \n5 \n (1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term \nor modifying or enlarg ing he conditions; or  \n(2) revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant \nunder subchapter A.   \n \nThe relevant United States Sentencing Guideline provisions involved in this \ncase are U.S.S.G. Chapter 7, Part A(3)(b); U.S.S.G.\u00a77B1.1(a)(2) & (b); U.S.S.G. \n\u00a77B1.3 application note 2., and U.S.S.G. \u00a77B1.4(a)   \nUSSG, Chapter 7, Part A  (3) (b) provides in relevant part  \nThe Commission debated two different approaches to \nsanctioning violations of probation and supervised release.  \n \nThe first option consid ered a violation resulting from a \ndefendant\u2019s failure to follow the court -imposed conditions of probation \nor supervised release as a \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d  While the nature of the \nconduct leading to the revocation would be considered in measuring \nthe extent of the breach of trust, imposition of an appropriate \npunishment for any new criminal conduct would not be the primary \ngoal of a revocation sentence.  Instead, the sentence imposed upon \nrevocation would be intended to sanction the violator for failing to \nabide by the conditions of the court -ordered supervision, leaving the \npunishment for any new criminal conduct to the court responsible for \nimposing the sentence for that offense.   \n \nThe second option considered by the Commission sought to \nsanction violators f or the particular conduct triggering the revocation \nas if that conduct were being sentenced as a new federal criminal \nconduct. \u2026\u2026\u2026  \n \nIn addition, the Commission rejected the second option because \nthat option was inconsistent with its views that the court wi th \njurisdiction over the criminal conduct leading to revocation is the more \nappropriate body to impose punishment for that new criminal \nconduct....... \n \nAfter lengthy consideration, the Commission adopted an \napproach that is consistent with the theory of th e first option; i.e. , at \n \n6 \n revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach \nof trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness \nof the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator. \n\u2026\u2026..  \n \u2026\u2026\u2026.    \n \nSee USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).

Tanco- Pizarro, Case No. 3:06 -cr-00257- 008 (PG) \n(Hon. Juan M. Perez- Gimenez presiding)  \n \n9 \n U.S.S.G) established  guideline range was only six (6) to twelve (12) months.  \nThe Petitioner appealed the supervised rele ase revocation to the First Circuit \nCourt Appeals which affirmed the district court sentence. T he Petitioner now seeks \na Writ of Ce rtiorari  to this Court to review the Judgment and Opinion of the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  On appeal to the First Circu it, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro \nchallenged the Revocation Judgment arguing that the 500% upward variant \nsentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable .    \nRelevant Background : \nRegarding the underlying criminal prosecution, Petitioner Rafael Tanco -\nPizarro was arrested on August 6, 2006 on a criminal complaint, and subsequently \ncharged in a six count Indictment with ten other defendants on August 10, 2006.  \nThe Indictment charged the group with two drug conspiracy counts under Title 21 \nUSC \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) a nd 846; and four firearm related counts under Title 18 UUSC \u00a7\u00a7 \n924(c), 922(g), 922(k), and 2.   \nPursuant to a Plea Agreement, on January 9, 2007 Mr. Tanco -Pizarro \nentered a plea of guilty to Count 3 of the Indictment, possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense.  At sentencing, the remaining five charges \nwere dismissed.).    \nOn April 19, 2007, in the underlying Judgment, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was \nsentenced to serve a sentence of 60 months followed by a term of 5 years supervised \nrelease.   \n \n10 \n Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was released from prison and began his term of supervised \nrelease on December 14, 2010. Mr. Tanco -Pizarro successfully completed four years \nof his five - year term without violations until December 2014.  \nOn December 30, 2014 the Probati on Office filed a Motion Notifying \nViolations of Conditions of Supervised Release and Request for Issuance of a \nWarrant, alleging two violations : (1) failure to submit written monthly reports in \nviolation of Supervised Release Condition Number Two, and (2 ) failure to update \ncontact information and failure to report as instructed in violation of Supervised \nRelease Condition Number Three.  On December 30, 2014, the court issued an \nOrder granting the Motion to Show Cause regarding Revocation of Supervised \nRelease and the Motion for Arrest Warrant.  \nOn September 21, 2015, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was arrested for new criminal \nconduct and was brought before the court for a consolidated Initial Appearance on \nthe December 30, 2015 motion to revoke supervised release and the September 21, \n2015 criminal complaint in the new criminal matter.3 On September 30, 2015 the \nProbation Office filed a Supplemental Motion Notifying Additional Violations of \nConditions of Supervised Release, alleging the following additional violations:   (1)  \n                                                 \n3 Mr. Tanco was charged with new criminal conduct by Criminal Complaint on \nSeptember 21, 2015, alleging the same criminal conduct which was part ly the basis \nfor Revocation of Supervised Release, namely:  Felon in Possession of a Firearm on \nSeptember 19, 2015.  The new criminal matter was initially docketed as 3:15- mj-\n01380- BJM, and subsequently docketed as USA v. Tanco -Pizarro , 3:15 -cr-00616-\nJAF-1.   \n \n11 \n arrest for and commission of new criminal conduct for possession of firearms and \nammunition on September 19, 2015 in violation of statutory conditions of \nsupervised release; (2) failure to notify supervising officer of change in residence in \nviolati on of standard condition number six; and (3) unlawful use of controlled \nsubstances in violation of standard condition number seven.   \nOn October 5, 2015 the magistrate judge held a consolidated Arraignment on \nthe Indictment in the new criminal matter, Unit ed States v. Tanco- Pizarro , case 3: \n15-cr-00616- JAF-1; and a Preliminary Revocation Hearing  in the district case \ngiving rise to this appeal,  United States v. Tanco- Pizarro , case 3 :06-cr-00257- 008 \n(PG).  \nOn October 16, 2015, Petitioner  filed a Motion to Cont inue the final \nRevocation Hearing from October 23, 2015 to January 13, 2016  on the grounds \nthat: (1) the petitions for revocation allege new criminal conduct and failure to \nfollow instructions of the probation officer; (2) the offense alleged in the new \ncriminal prosecution arraigned on October 5, 2015, United States v. Tanco \u2013  \nPizarro , 3:15- cr-00616- JAF-1, constitutes the most serious ground for revocation in \nthe instant case; and (3) the outcome in the new criminal prosecution may have an \neffect in dispo sition of the instant case.   The Motion to Continue was summarily \ndenied on October 21, 2015.   \nOn October 21, 2015, Petitioner  filed a Motion for Discovery regarding \nSupervised Release Revocation requesting, in lieu of the denied continuance, the \n \n12 \n court o rder the Probation Officer and/or Government to produce evidence regarding \nthe alleged new criminal conduct prior to final revocation hearing pursuant to \nFederal Rules Criminal Procedure, Rules 26.2, 32.1(b)(2) and 32.1(e).  The Motion \nfor Discovery was  similarly  denied.   \nA Revocation Report was not filed by Probation, nor was the original PSR \namended or updated.   \nThe matter proceeded to final revocation hearing on October 23, 201 5.  \nPetitioner  admitted that he had been  Indicted for new criminal conduct , but \nPetitioner did not admit underlying conduct .  The district court found the alleged \nnew criminal conduct violation based on the new Indictment in the parallel criminal \ncase charging  the same criminal conduct triggering  revocation  (felon in possession \nof firearms in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922 (g)(1) and \u00a7924(a)(2).4   \nThe Government  asked the court to impose the statutory maximum sentence \nof 60 months, but the Petitioner  argued for a lower sentence because Petitioner \nfaced a substantial consecutive  sentence in the parallel criminal prosecution for the \nsame criminal conduct.   \nAlthough the advisory guideline range was 6 to 12 months, the court imposed \nthe statutory maximum sentence of 5 years \u2013  an upward variance of 48 months  \nfrom the high end of the advisory revocation guideline .  \nOn October 28, 2015, the defense filed a Motion for Reconsideration arguing  \n                                                 \n4 United States v. Rafael Tanco- Pizarro, 3:15 -cr-616 (JAF)  \n \n13 \n that the district court impermissibly sentenced the Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct and the sentence was substantively and procedurally unre asonable.  On \nFebruary 9, 2016 the Government filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion for \nReconsideration. On April 5, 2015, the district court denied the motion for \nreconsideration.  \nIn the interim, o n October 30, 2015, P etitioner filed a timely noti ce of appeal  \nof October 23, 2015 Revocation Judgment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals , for \nwhich Petitioner now seeks a Writ of Certiorari.  \nDecisions by  The First Circuit for Which Review Is Sought  \nQuestion One  \u2013 Prohibited Sentencing Factors :  \nPetit ioner argued that  the supervised release revocation sentence is \nprocedurally unreasonable for reasons including that the court punished the \nPetitioner for the new criminal conduct rather than breach of trust by improperly \nconsidering the punishment factor in Title 18 U.S. C.\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  Petitioner \nargued that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is a prohibited factor by omission from Title U.S.C. \n3583(e) list of sentencing factors to be considered. That the sentencing court erred \nby considering a forbidden factor and punishe d the Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct.  \nCiting the Second Circuit, in United States v. Williams , 443 F.3d 35, 47 (2nd \nCir. 2006), t he First Circuit held that Title 18 USC \u00a7 3583(e) simply requires \nconsideration of the enumerated subsections without forbidding consideration of \n \n14 \n other pertinent factors.  United States v. Tanco- Pizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case \nNo. 15 -2388, Opinion page 14, Appendix A, page 15. The First Circuit further ruled \nthat Petitioner\u2019s arguments had been rejected by prior First Circuit decisions in \nUnited States v. Vargas -Davila , 649 F.3d 129, 131- 132 (1st Cir. 2011), United States \nv. Bohan , 496 F. App\u2019x 95, 96 & 96 n. 1 (1st Cir 2012), and United States v. Soto-\nSoto, 855 F.3d 445, 451 (1st Cir. 2017), in which the First Circuit previously held \nthat \u201cthe seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, [and] providing \njust punishment\u201d were proper \u2026..sentencing factors.\u201d United States v. Tanco-\nPizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case No. 15 -2388, Opinion page 16, Appendix A, pa ge \n17 (internal quotations omitted).     \nQuestion Two \u2013 Due Process Violation : \nPetitioner argued that the district court denied Petitioner due process by \nimproperly denying Petitioner an opportunity to obtain evidence that would be \navailable in the parallel criminal prosecution when it denied Petitioner\u2019s Motion for \nDiscovery and Motion to Continue upon courts denial of Motion for Discovery.  \nThe First Circuit rejected this argument based on its perception that the trial \nattorney failed to adequately preserv e issues raised in Petitioner motions and, \ntherefore, Petitioner did not satisfy the standard for finding plain error.   United \nStates v. Tanco- Pizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case No. 15 -2388, Opinion page 11 -\n12, Appendix A, page 12-13. \n \n \n15 \n REASONS FOR GRANTING THE W RIT \nI. The question whether the punishment factor of the federal sentencing \nstatute, Title 18 U.S.C \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), is a permissible or prohibited \nfactor in sentencing a revocation defendant under the statute \ngoverning Revocations of Supervised Release, Title  18 USC \u00a7 3583(e), \nwas decided by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in conflict with \ndecisions by some circuits but in consensus with other circuits, which \ncircuit split should be resolved by this Court; and it is an important \nquestion of federal  statuto ry law affecting other defendants that has \nnot been, but should be, addressed by this Court.  \n \nPetitioner\u2019s supervised release was revoked by the district court pursuant to \nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), and sentenced to serve the statutory maximum of five \nyears for the violation s although the guideline sentencing range on revocation was \nsix to twelve months for a Grade B violation and Criminal History II representing a \n500% increase from the guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a77B1.1(a)(2) and 7B1.4(a) .     \nPetitioner argued on appeal to the First Circuit that th e sentencing court \nimpermissibly focused on the Title 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) punishment factor (\u201cto \nreflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to prov ide \njust punishment for the offense\u201d)  and punished Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct rather than sanctioning Petitioner for breach of trust for violating \nsupervised release.   Petitioner argued to the First Circuit was that the dramatic \n500% upward variant sentence was not supportable as both procedurally and \nsubstantively reasonable.  \nThe First Circuit Ruled that  the Title 18 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3583(e) (supervised release \nrevocation ) omission of  Title 18 U.S.C . \u00a7 3553 (a)(2)(A) (punishment factor) does not \n \n16 \n forbid consideration of that sentencing factor.    \nPetitioner requests this Court Grant Writ of Certiorari to address this issue \nbecause there is a split in the circuits that this Court has not, but should, address; \nand it is an important question of federal law  statutory law affecting other \ndefendants  that has not been, but should be, addressed by this Court . Supreme  \nCourt Rules, Rule 10.  \nA court\u2019s authority to revoke a term of supervised release is conferred by Title \n18 USC \u00a73583(e).   \n  Applying the Guideline 7B1(a)(1) to the alleged facts, the court found that \nAppellant\u2019s highest violation was a grade B violation and Appellant had a criminal \nhistory category II.  The guideline sentencing range for this offense was six to \ntwelve months.  See USSG \u00a7\u00a77B1.1(a)(2), 7B1.4(a).   \nHowever, the district court sentenced the Appellant to serve the statutory \nmaximum of five years of imprisonment (\u00a73583(e)(3) establishes five years as the \nstatutory maximum for Class A felonies). The sen tence ordered by the district court \nwas 48 months higher than the high end of the guideline range.   Petitioner argued \nto the First Circuit that district court record demonstrated  that the sentencing \njudge knew that there was a parallel criminal prosecution in the same court for th e \nsame criminal conduct serving as the basis for revocation, felon in possession of a \nfirearm. The district court further knew that Petitioner  faced a substantial sentence \nin that matter for the same conduct that he  was sentencing the Petitioner upon \n \n17 \n revocation of supervised release.5 \n  The provisions for revocation of a term of supervised release are found in \nTitle 18 USC \u00a73583(e), (g) -(i).  See 18 USC \u00a73583 and USSG  \u00a77B1 .3, application \nnote 2.   \nPetitioner a rgued that Guideline \u00a77B1.1 -5, and some, but not all, 18 USC \u00a7 \n3553(a) factors, apply to revocation sentencing. See 18 USC \u00a73583(e) and \n\u00a73553(a)(4)(B) and (5).  Title 18 USC \u00a73583(e) provides that: \u201cThe court may, after \nconsidering  the fa ctors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), \n(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) -  \u2026 revoke a term of supervised release, and require \nthe defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release\u2026\u201d.  18 \nUSC \u00a73583( e) and (e)(3), emphasis added.  \nIn contrast to probation revocation re -sentencings under Title 18 USC \n\u00a73565(a), supervised release revocation under 18 USC \u00a73565 does not incorporate \nall of the \u00a73553(a) factors.  Contrast 18 USC \u00a73583(e) and 18 USC \u00a73565(a).   As \nargued by defense counsel below, in the Motion for Reconsideration, a court may not \n                                                 \n5 Although the result of the parallel prosecution occurred after revocation \nsentencing in this matter, and the Judgment in that case is not part of the record in \nthis case, the F irst Court took judicial notice of the result:  Appellant was convicted \nin the parallel prosecution for felon in possession and received a 57- month  sentence \nto be served consecutive to the 60 -month  sentence in this matter.  (United States v. \nTanco Pizarro,  3:15- cr-00616- 1-JAF, Judgment at ECF # 36).  Petitioner noted  that \nhe was effectively sentenced to serve 119 months for the same conduct -  felon in \npossession of firearm \u2013  which is a Grade B supervised release violation under USSG \n\u00a77B1.1(a)(2)  with a  statutory maximum of five years .  See USSG \u00a77B1.1(a)(2 ) and \napplication note 5.     \n \n \n18 \n consider factor \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) (\u201c to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote \nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d) when imp osing \na supervised release sentence.   See 18 USC \u00a73583(e) specifically omitting \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as a factor to be considered.   \nPetitioner argued that the appropriate statutory construction requires the \nconclusion that a revocation court may appropriately sanction a violator for his \nbreach of trust, and may consider the specifically  enumerated factors in \u00a73583(e).  \nHowever, a revocation court may not punish the defendant for the new criminal \nconduct underlying the revocation.  See United States v. Hammons , 558 F.3d 1100, \n1104 (9th Cir. 2009) quoting  United States v. Miqbel , 444 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir. \n2006); See also United States v. Crudup, 461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir. 2006)(\u201cin \ndevising a revocation sentence the district court is not authorized to consid er\u201d \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A)); United States v. Simtob ,  485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007)(court \nmay not impose revocation sentence solely or even primarily on the new criminal \noffense underlying the revocation).  But see, United States v. Lewis , 498 F.3d 393, \n399-400 (6th Cir. 2007) ( holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to \nconsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for violation of supervised \nrelease, even though this factor is not enumerated in \u00a73583(e).\u201d); and see United \nStates v. Williams , 443 F.3d 35, 47 (2nd Cir. 2006)(court interpreted \u00a73583(e) as \nrequiring consideration of enumerated \u00a73553(a) factors without forbidding \nconsideration of other pertinent factors including \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)).     \n \n19 \n The purpose of supervised release it to help reintegrate the offender into \nsociety upon release from prison, not to extend punishment for the offense.  It \nfollows that a revocation sentence should focus on the personal characteristics of the \noffender, not on the greater universe of considerations impli cated by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)).  \nPetitioner  urges this Court adopt the interpretation of the Ninth Fifth and \nFourth Circuits that a court\u2019s consideration of factors in revocation of supervised \nrelease is limited to those factors specifically listed in \u00a73583(e).  Appellant asks \nthat this Court adopt the position of the Ninth , Fifth and Fourth Circuit that it is \nimpermissible to consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when sentencing a defendant for \nsupervised release violations.   \nSupport for this interpretation is also found in different sect ions of \u00a73583: (1) \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is also specifically omitted from the factors the court is to consider \nunder \u00a73583(c) when including a term of supervised release at the time of original \nsentencing; (2) \u00a73583(d) permits a court to order further conditions  of supervised \nrelease but limits the scope of additional factors to be considered and excludes \nspecifically \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  See Title 18 USC 3583.  \nThe district court\u2019s stated reason for the sentence impermissibly weighted \nconsideration of the \u00a73553(a)(2 )(A) punishment factor : \u201cTo reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the \noffense\u2026\u2026the Court includes that a statutory sentence is sufficient but not greater \nthan necessary in this case.\u201d    Not only did the district court consider \n \n20 \n 3553(a)(2)(A) as a factor in sentencing, Petitioner argued the record supported the \nconclusion that the district court gave this impermissible factor disproportionately \nmore weig ht than the other factors recited.   \nPetitioner argued to the First Circuit that t he prohibited factor construction \nof \u00a73583(e) is reinforced by the policy statements of USSG Chapter 7, Res olution of \nMajor Issues  and the Commission \u2019s adoption of the first approach \u2013  breach of trust \nfor violating supervised release, not punishment for the new criminal conduct .  The \nCommission explain ed that it debated two different approaches to sanctioning \nviolations of probation and supervised release , ultimately choosing the first \napproach as the appropriate approach to sanctioning violations of supervised \nrelease.   See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).    \nThe first approach focused on treating violations of  court -imposed  conditions \nas a \u201cbreach of trust .\u201d The \u201cnature of the conduct leading to revocation could be \nconsidered in measuring the extent of the breach of trust .\u201d However, punishment for \nany new criminal conduct would be left \u201cto the court responsible  for imposing \nsentence for that offense.\u201d See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).      \nThe second  approach focused on \u201c sanctioning  violators for the particular \nconduct triggering the revocation as if that conduct were being sentenced as new \ncriminal conduct.\u201d    See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).  \n Petitioner argued to the First Circuit that he Commission \u2019s adopt ion of  the \nfirst approach  \u2013 sanction for breach of trust not the new criminal conduct  \u2013 supports \n \n21 \n Petitioner\u2019s argument that the omission of 18 USC \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was intended to \nbe a prohibition of considering the punishment factor when determining the \nappropriate sentence for a supervised release revocation under 18 USC \u00a7 3583(e).  \nSee USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b) , 18 USC \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and 18 US C \u00a7 3583(e)  \n Petitioner argued that the record from the sentencing court supported the \nconclusion that the sentencing court punished Petitioner  for the new criminal \nconduct , even though Petitioner was being prosecuted in a separate parallel new \ncriminal ac tion for the same new criminal conduct triggering the revocation of \nsupervised release. The other violation, Petitioner argued, was a failure to report \nviolation that would not justify the statutory maximum sentence imposed by the \nsentencing court .   \nThe F irst Circuit rejected this argument and held instead that 18 USC \u00a7 \n3553(a)(2)(A) was a permissible factor even though it is omitted from the 18 USC \u00a7 \n3583(e) list of factors.  Ruling that the list of factors is merely a recommendation \nnot a mandate, and th e sentence imposed was substantively reasonable.  \nPetitioner argued that the sentencing court  punished Petitioner  for the new \ncriminal conduct  rather than sanctioning Petitioner for his breach of trust.  The \nFirst Circuit rejected this argument  and determi ned at the abuse of discretion \nstandard that the 500% upward variant sentence was substantively reasonable \neven though the Petitioner faced a lengthy sentence for the same new criminal \nconduct in the parallel prosecution to be served consecutively to the r evocation \n \n22 \n sentence.   \nIn deciding Petitioner\u2019s case, t he First Circuit  opinion results in a conclu sion \nthat Petitioner believes is inconsistent with statutory l aw; i.e., that a sentencing \ncourt may punish a defendant f or the new criminal conduct that serves as a basis \nfor s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 42,000 characters]\n\n23: Supreme Court to decide about supervised release (score: 0.542)\nTopic: Statutory interpretation of supervised release statutes\nFound via search query: statutory interpretation supervised release\nSupreme Court to decide about supervised release - Medill on the Hill Home Business Education Health Living Politics National Security Environment Reporters Select Page Home Business Education Health Living Politics National Security Environment Reporters Supreme Court to decide about supervised release by Jeremy Fredricks and Samanta Habashy | Feb 25, 2025 | Featured, National SecurityThe Supreme Court heard Esteras v. United States on Feb. 25, 2025. The oral arguments centered around what factors can be used in cases that revoke supervised release. (Photo by Jeremy Fredricks/MNS) WASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court justices heard arguments Tuesday on which factors courts can consider when revoking supervised release for criminal defendants when not all possible factors are explicitly listed under federal law. Supervised release is when someone follows strict conditions after they have finished their sentence from federal prison, unlike parole, which releases someone early on good behavior. The case was brought by Edgardo Esteras, who served 27 months in federal prison for drug trafficking related convictions before starting a six-year supervised release in Ohio in 2020. However, in 2023 a compliance check uncovered a firearm, violating Esteras\u2019 release terms and leading to his arrest. At his revocation hearing, Judge Benita Pearson described Esteras\u2019s behavior as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and sentenced Esteras to an additional two years in prison and three more years of supervised release after that. At the core of Esteras v. United States is whether judges like Pearson can consider factors such as the seriousness of the offense and promoting respect for the law when revoking supervised release, even though those factors aren\u2019t explicitly listed in the law Congress wrote. Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, federal courts can impose supervised release for those convicted of federal crimes. This means that after serving a prison sentence, individuals remain under court supervision as they transition back into society. During this time, they must follow specific conditions set by a judge, and violations could result in additional prison time. Comparably, parole, which allows early release from prison for good behavior, lets judges consider factors like the seriousness of the original crime, respect for the law, and just punishment when handling violations. However, while the Sentencing Reform Act requires judges to weigh these factors during initial sentencing, the Act omits them for supervised release violations. The Supreme Court is weighing whether judges can consider the seriousness of the original crime when deciding if someone should return to prison for violating supervised release since supervised release is not meant to further punish someone but to rehabilitate. \u201cIf you violate your parole, you have done a morally wrong thing\u2026we put some faith in you, we let you out early,\u201d said Jacob Schuman, a law professor at Temple University who wrote an amicus brief in support of Esteras. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t apply to supervised release. Nobody did you any favors by giving you supervised release. You haven\u2019t done anything morally wrong.\u201d This issue has divided nine of the U.S. Circuit appellate courts. Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the Sixth Circuit, in his majority opinion, wrote that the statute does not limit judges to only the enumerated factors, granting discretion in considering broader judicial principles, including deterrence and community safety. Four additional circuits ruled similarly, while four others sided with Esteras. Masha Hansford, arguing for the government, said judges should have the option\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to consider factors like the seriousness of the offense, respect for the law, and just punishment. She compared it to a college allowing students to take extra courses beyond the required prerequisites for declaring a major. 19,418 people violated the terms of their supervised release in 2021, which is about 30% of all people on supervised release, according to the U.S. Courts. Brooklyn Law School Professor Cynthia Godsoe said a judge\u2019s job is to interpret and apply laws, not create new rules or expand their powers beyond what the law permits. \u201cWhat we argued in the amicus brief is judges overstepping their role to impose these sentences,\u201d Godsoe said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not incarcerated, you\u2019re still under supervision.\u201d Godsoe\u2019s bottom line: Congress deliberately omitted factors regarding what judges can and can\u2019t consider regarding supervised release revocation. Justice Neil Gorsuch approached the issue from a \u201clinguistic perspective,\u201d arguing that the statute\u2019s language did not explicitly prohibit judges from considering additional factors. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it quite goes so far to say you must not consider other factors,\u201d he said, noting the statute\u2019s absence of a clear \u201cmust-not\u201d clause. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Esteras, it will standardize the factors judges can consider when revoking supervised release, ensuring they adhere strictly to those explicitly listed in federal law. Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern about the practical implications of restricting judicial considerations during supervised release revocation hearings. \u201cHow is the judge going to consider the nature and circumstances of that offense without considering the severity of the offense?\u201d Alito asked.

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to address a circuit split over what factors judges can consider when sentencing a person for violating conditions of supervised release, an issue estimated to affect thousands of defendants each year. The justices granted a petition for certiorari on Oct. 21 in three Sixth Circuit cases that upheld sentences for defendants who had violated their release conditions. The men \u2014 Edgardo Esteras, Timothy Michael Jaimez and Toriano A. Leaks Jr. \u2014 claim the court was wrong to allow their judges to consider three of the standard sentencing factors: the need for the sentence to promote respect for the law, reflect the seriousness of the offense and provide just punishment for it. Those three considerations are baked into the sentencing rubric that Congress gave judges, but lawmakers left them out of the statute concerning what judges can consider when issuing a sentence for a supervised release violation. \"Congress drew a careful line instructing courts to rely on punishment and factors related to punishment only when sentencing defendants for their initial offenses, consistent with constitutional protections for those facing criminal punishment,\" the men said in their petition. \"The decisions below erased that line.\" The petition argued that the split among the appeals courts over what factors are permissible is \"deep and pervasive.\" The First, Second, Third, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that judges can consider the three factors despite their omission from the law, while the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have ruled that courts may not rely on them, according to the petition. The question could affect thousands of cases a year, the men said, pointing to the 108,000 federal supervision violations from 2013 to 2017, with 86% of those resulting in a new prison term. Congress' decision to carve out the three standard sentencing factors from the overall list that judges should consider when handing down sentences for violations of supervised release should be interpreted as a sign that lawmakers meant to take those items off the table, the men said. They told the justices that is exactly how they read the similar exclusion of factors for judges to weigh when imposing a term of supervised release, and the high court most recently affirmed that view in its 2022 opinion in Concepcion v. United States. The consideration of punishment factors in revocation sentencings also raises double-jeopardy concerns, the petition said, adding that a defendant could be doubly punished for the same conduct if the supervised release violation is a crime by itself and the judge ups the sentence for the infraction on account of a need to punish. In its opposition brief, the government said Congress' decision to list certain factors \u2014 and exclude others \u2014 for judges to consider when revoking supervised release and resentencing doesn't mean those items not listed must be disregarded by courts. The law's list shows a \"legislative judgment that the factors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a court must consider,\" the government said. The U.S. Department of Justice argued that the men overstated the alleged disagreement in the various circuits that have ruled on the same question, adding that any \"modest disagreement has little practical effect and does not warrant this court's review.\" Representatives for the parties were not immediately available for comment on Monday. Esteras, Jaimez and Leaks are represented by Joseph Medici and Kevin M. Schad of the Federal Public Defender for the Southern District of Ohio, and Stephen C. Newman and Christian J. Grostic of the Federal Public Defender of the Northern District of Ohio. The U.S. Department of Justice is represented by its own Elizabeth B. Prelogar, Nicole M. Argentieri and Thomas E. Booth. The case is Esteras et al. v United States, case number 23-7483, in the U.S. Supreme Court. --Editing by Melissa Treolo. For a reprint of this article, please contact reprints@law360.com.

Revocation of probation  \n(a)Continuation or Revocation. \u2013 If the defendant violates a condition \nof probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the \nterm of probation, the court may, after a hearing pursuant to Rule 32.1 \nof the federal rules of criminal Procedure, and after considering the \nfactors set forth in  section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable - \n \n5 \n (1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term \nor modifying or enlarg ing he conditions; or  \n(2) revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the defendant \nunder subchapter A.   \n \nThe relevant United States Sentencing Guideline provisions involved in this \ncase are U.S.S.G. Chapter 7, Part A(3)(b); U.S.S.G.\u00a77B1.1(a)(2) & (b); U.S.S.G. \n\u00a77B1.3 application note 2., and U.S.S.G. \u00a77B1.4(a)   \nUSSG, Chapter 7, Part A  (3) (b) provides in relevant part  \nThe Commission debated two different approaches to \nsanctioning violations of probation and supervised release.  \n \nThe first option consid ered a violation resulting from a \ndefendant\u2019s failure to follow the court -imposed conditions of probation \nor supervised release as a \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d  While the nature of the \nconduct leading to the revocation would be considered in measuring \nthe extent of the breach of trust, imposition of an appropriate \npunishment for any new criminal conduct would not be the primary \ngoal of a revocation sentence.  Instead, the sentence imposed upon \nrevocation would be intended to sanction the violator for failing to \nabide by the conditions of the court -ordered supervision, leaving the \npunishment for any new criminal conduct to the court responsible for \nimposing the sentence for that offense.   \n \nThe second option considered by the Commission sought to \nsanction violators f or the particular conduct triggering the revocation \nas if that conduct were being sentenced as a new federal criminal \nconduct. \u2026\u2026\u2026  \n \nIn addition, the Commission rejected the second option because \nthat option was inconsistent with its views that the court wi th \njurisdiction over the criminal conduct leading to revocation is the more \nappropriate body to impose punishment for that new criminal \nconduct....... \n \nAfter lengthy consideration, the Commission adopted an \napproach that is consistent with the theory of th e first option; i.e. , at \n \n6 \n revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach \nof trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness \nof the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator. \n\u2026\u2026..  \n \u2026\u2026\u2026.    \n \nSee USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).

Tanco- Pizarro, Case No. 3:06 -cr-00257- 008 (PG) \n(Hon. Juan M. Perez- Gimenez presiding)  \n \n9 \n U.S.S.G) established  guideline range was only six (6) to twelve (12) months.  \nThe Petitioner appealed the supervised rele ase revocation to the First Circuit \nCourt Appeals which affirmed the district court sentence. T he Petitioner now seeks \na Writ of Ce rtiorari  to this Court to review the Judgment and Opinion of the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  On appeal to the First Circu it, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro \nchallenged the Revocation Judgment arguing that the 500% upward variant \nsentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable .    \nRelevant Background : \nRegarding the underlying criminal prosecution, Petitioner Rafael Tanco -\nPizarro was arrested on August 6, 2006 on a criminal complaint, and subsequently \ncharged in a six count Indictment with ten other defendants on August 10, 2006.  \nThe Indictment charged the group with two drug conspiracy counts under Title 21 \nUSC \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) a nd 846; and four firearm related counts under Title 18 UUSC \u00a7\u00a7 \n924(c), 922(g), 922(k), and 2.   \nPursuant to a Plea Agreement, on January 9, 2007 Mr. Tanco -Pizarro \nentered a plea of guilty to Count 3 of the Indictment, possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense.  At sentencing, the remaining five charges \nwere dismissed.).    \nOn April 19, 2007, in the underlying Judgment, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was \nsentenced to serve a sentence of 60 months followed by a term of 5 years supervised \nrelease.   \n \n10 \n Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was released from prison and began his term of supervised \nrelease on December 14, 2010. Mr. Tanco -Pizarro successfully completed four years \nof his five - year term without violations until December 2014.  \nOn December 30, 2014 the Probati on Office filed a Motion Notifying \nViolations of Conditions of Supervised Release and Request for Issuance of a \nWarrant, alleging two violations : (1) failure to submit written monthly reports in \nviolation of Supervised Release Condition Number Two, and (2 ) failure to update \ncontact information and failure to report as instructed in violation of Supervised \nRelease Condition Number Three.  On December 30, 2014, the court issued an \nOrder granting the Motion to Show Cause regarding Revocation of Supervised \nRelease and the Motion for Arrest Warrant.  \nOn September 21, 2015, Mr. Tanco -Pizarro was arrested for new criminal \nconduct and was brought before the court for a consolidated Initial Appearance on \nthe December 30, 2015 motion to revoke supervised release and the September 21, \n2015 criminal complaint in the new criminal matter.3 On September 30, 2015 the \nProbation Office filed a Supplemental Motion Notifying Additional Violations of \nConditions of Supervised Release, alleging the following additional violations:   (1)  \n                                                 \n3 Mr. Tanco was charged with new criminal conduct by Criminal Complaint on \nSeptember 21, 2015, alleging the same criminal conduct which was part ly the basis \nfor Revocation of Supervised Release, namely:  Felon in Possession of a Firearm on \nSeptember 19, 2015.  The new criminal matter was initially docketed as 3:15- mj-\n01380- BJM, and subsequently docketed as USA v. Tanco -Pizarro , 3:15 -cr-00616-\nJAF-1.   \n \n11 \n arrest for and commission of new criminal conduct for possession of firearms and \nammunition on September 19, 2015 in violation of statutory conditions of \nsupervised release; (2) failure to notify supervising officer of change in residence in \nviolati on of standard condition number six; and (3) unlawful use of controlled \nsubstances in violation of standard condition number seven.   \nOn October 5, 2015 the magistrate judge held a consolidated Arraignment on \nthe Indictment in the new criminal matter, Unit ed States v. Tanco- Pizarro , case 3: \n15-cr-00616- JAF-1; and a Preliminary Revocation Hearing  in the district case \ngiving rise to this appeal,  United States v. Tanco- Pizarro , case 3 :06-cr-00257- 008 \n(PG).  \nOn October 16, 2015, Petitioner  filed a Motion to Cont inue the final \nRevocation Hearing from October 23, 2015 to January 13, 2016  on the grounds \nthat: (1) the petitions for revocation allege new criminal conduct and failure to \nfollow instructions of the probation officer; (2) the offense alleged in the new \ncriminal prosecution arraigned on October 5, 2015, United States v. Tanco \u2013  \nPizarro , 3:15- cr-00616- JAF-1, constitutes the most serious ground for revocation in \nthe instant case; and (3) the outcome in the new criminal prosecution may have an \neffect in dispo sition of the instant case.   The Motion to Continue was summarily \ndenied on October 21, 2015.   \nOn October 21, 2015, Petitioner  filed a Motion for Discovery regarding \nSupervised Release Revocation requesting, in lieu of the denied continuance, the \n \n12 \n court o rder the Probation Officer and/or Government to produce evidence regarding \nthe alleged new criminal conduct prior to final revocation hearing pursuant to \nFederal Rules Criminal Procedure, Rules 26.2, 32.1(b)(2) and 32.1(e).  The Motion \nfor Discovery was  similarly  denied.   \nA Revocation Report was not filed by Probation, nor was the original PSR \namended or updated.   \nThe matter proceeded to final revocation hearing on October 23, 201 5.  \nPetitioner  admitted that he had been  Indicted for new criminal conduct , but \nPetitioner did not admit underlying conduct .  The district court found the alleged \nnew criminal conduct violation based on the new Indictment in the parallel criminal \ncase charging  the same criminal conduct triggering  revocation  (felon in possession \nof firearms in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922 (g)(1) and \u00a7924(a)(2).4   \nThe Government  asked the court to impose the statutory maximum sentence \nof 60 months, but the Petitioner  argued for a lower sentence because Petitioner \nfaced a substantial consecutive  sentence in the parallel criminal prosecution for the \nsame criminal conduct.   \nAlthough the advisory guideline range was 6 to 12 months, the court imposed \nthe statutory maximum sentence of 5 years \u2013  an upward variance of 48 months  \nfrom the high end of the advisory revocation guideline .  \nOn October 28, 2015, the defense filed a Motion for Reconsideration arguing  \n                                                 \n4 United States v. Rafael Tanco- Pizarro, 3:15 -cr-616 (JAF)  \n \n13 \n that the district court impermissibly sentenced the Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct and the sentence was substantively and procedurally unre asonable.  On \nFebruary 9, 2016 the Government filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion for \nReconsideration. On April 5, 2015, the district court denied the motion for \nreconsideration.  \nIn the interim, o n October 30, 2015, P etitioner filed a timely noti ce of appeal  \nof October 23, 2015 Revocation Judgment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals , for \nwhich Petitioner now seeks a Writ of Certiorari.  \nDecisions by  The First Circuit for Which Review Is Sought  \nQuestion One  \u2013 Prohibited Sentencing Factors :  \nPetit ioner argued that  the supervised release revocation sentence is \nprocedurally unreasonable for reasons including that the court punished the \nPetitioner for the new criminal conduct rather than breach of trust by improperly \nconsidering the punishment factor in Title 18 U.S. C.\u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  Petitioner \nargued that \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is a prohibited factor by omission from Title U.S.C. \n3583(e) list of sentencing factors to be considered. That the sentencing court erred \nby considering a forbidden factor and punishe d the Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct.  \nCiting the Second Circuit, in United States v. Williams , 443 F.3d 35, 47 (2nd \nCir. 2006), t he First Circuit held that Title 18 USC \u00a7 3583(e) simply requires \nconsideration of the enumerated subsections without forbidding consideration of \n \n14 \n other pertinent factors.  United States v. Tanco- Pizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case \nNo. 15 -2388, Opinion page 14, Appendix A, page 15. The First Circuit further ruled \nthat Petitioner\u2019s arguments had been rejected by prior First Circuit decisions in \nUnited States v. Vargas -Davila , 649 F.3d 129, 131- 132 (1st Cir. 2011), United States \nv. Bohan , 496 F. App\u2019x 95, 96 & 96 n. 1 (1st Cir 2012), and United States v. Soto-\nSoto, 855 F.3d 445, 451 (1st Cir. 2017), in which the First Circuit previously held \nthat \u201cthe seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, [and] providing \njust punishment\u201d were proper \u2026..sentencing factors.\u201d United States v. Tanco-\nPizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case No. 15 -2388, Opinion page 16, Appendix A, pa ge \n17 (internal quotations omitted).     \nQuestion Two \u2013 Due Process Violation : \nPetitioner argued that the district court denied Petitioner due process by \nimproperly denying Petitioner an opportunity to obtain evidence that would be \navailable in the parallel criminal prosecution when it denied Petitioner\u2019s Motion for \nDiscovery and Motion to Continue upon courts denial of Motion for Discovery.  \nThe First Circuit rejected this argument based on its perception that the trial \nattorney failed to adequately preserv e issues raised in Petitioner motions and, \ntherefore, Petitioner did not satisfy the standard for finding plain error.   United \nStates v. Tanco- Pizarro , USCA, First Circuit, Case No. 15 -2388, Opinion page 11 -\n12, Appendix A, page 12-13. \n \n \n15 \n REASONS FOR GRANTING THE W RIT \nI. The question whether the punishment factor of the federal sentencing \nstatute, Title 18 U.S.C \u00a73553(a)(2)(A), is a permissible or prohibited \nfactor in sentencing a revocation defendant under the statute \ngoverning Revocations of Supervised Release, Title  18 USC \u00a7 3583(e), \nwas decided by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in conflict with \ndecisions by some circuits but in consensus with other circuits, which \ncircuit split should be resolved by this Court; and it is an important \nquestion of federal  statuto ry law affecting other defendants that has \nnot been, but should be, addressed by this Court.  \n \nPetitioner\u2019s supervised release was revoked by the district court pursuant to \nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), and sentenced to serve the statutory maximum of five \nyears for the violation s although the guideline sentencing range on revocation was \nsix to twelve months for a Grade B violation and Criminal History II representing a \n500% increase from the guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a77B1.1(a)(2) and 7B1.4(a) .     \nPetitioner argued on appeal to the First Circuit that th e sentencing court \nimpermissibly focused on the Title 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) punishment factor (\u201cto \nreflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to prov ide \njust punishment for the offense\u201d)  and punished Petitioner for the new criminal \nconduct rather than sanctioning Petitioner for breach of trust for violating \nsupervised release.   Petitioner argued to the First Circuit was that the dramatic \n500% upward variant sentence was not supportable as both procedurally and \nsubstantively reasonable.  \nThe First Circuit Ruled that  the Title 18 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3583(e) (supervised release \nrevocation ) omission of  Title 18 U.S.C . \u00a7 3553 (a)(2)(A) (punishment factor) does not \n \n16 \n forbid consideration of that sentencing factor.    \nPetitioner requests this Court Grant Writ of Certiorari to address this issue \nbecause there is a split in the circuits that this Court has not, but should, address; \nand it is an important question of federal law  statutory law affecting other \ndefendants  that has not been, but should be, addressed by this Court . Supreme  \nCourt Rules, Rule 10.  \nA court\u2019s authority to revoke a term of supervised release is conferred by Title \n18 USC \u00a73583(e).   \n  Applying the Guideline 7B1(a)(1) to the alleged facts, the court found that \nAppellant\u2019s highest violation was a grade B violation and Appellant had a criminal \nhistory category II.  The guideline sentencing range for this offense was six to \ntwelve months.  See USSG \u00a7\u00a77B1.1(a)(2), 7B1.4(a).   \nHowever, the district court sentenced the Appellant to serve the statutory \nmaximum of five years of imprisonment (\u00a73583(e)(3) establishes five years as the \nstatutory maximum for Class A felonies). The sen tence ordered by the district court \nwas 48 months higher than the high end of the guideline range.   Petitioner argued \nto the First Circuit that district court record demonstrated  that the sentencing \njudge knew that there was a parallel criminal prosecution in the same court for th e \nsame criminal conduct serving as the basis for revocation, felon in possession of a \nfirearm. The district court further knew that Petitioner  faced a substantial sentence \nin that matter for the same conduct that he  was sentencing the Petitioner upon \n \n17 \n revocation of supervised release.5 \n  The provisions for revocation of a term of supervised release are found in \nTitle 18 USC \u00a73583(e), (g) -(i).  See 18 USC \u00a73583 and USSG  \u00a77B1 .3, application \nnote 2.   \nPetitioner a rgued that Guideline \u00a77B1.1 -5, and some, but not all, 18 USC \u00a7 \n3553(a) factors, apply to revocation sentencing. See 18 USC \u00a73583(e) and \n\u00a73553(a)(4)(B) and (5).  Title 18 USC \u00a73583(e) provides that: \u201cThe court may, after \nconsidering  the fa ctors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), \n(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7) -  \u2026 revoke a term of supervised release, and require \nthe defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release\u2026\u201d.  18 \nUSC \u00a73583( e) and (e)(3), emphasis added.  \nIn contrast to probation revocation re -sentencings under Title 18 USC \n\u00a73565(a), supervised release revocation under 18 USC \u00a73565 does not incorporate \nall of the \u00a73553(a) factors.  Contrast 18 USC \u00a73583(e) and 18 USC \u00a73565(a).   As \nargued by defense counsel below, in the Motion for Reconsideration, a court may not \n                                                 \n5 Although the result of the parallel prosecution occurred after revocation \nsentencing in this matter, and the Judgment in that case is not part of the record in \nthis case, the F irst Court took judicial notice of the result:  Appellant was convicted \nin the parallel prosecution for felon in possession and received a 57- month  sentence \nto be served consecutive to the 60 -month  sentence in this matter.  (United States v. \nTanco Pizarro,  3:15- cr-00616- 1-JAF, Judgment at ECF # 36).  Petitioner noted  that \nhe was effectively sentenced to serve 119 months for the same conduct -  felon in \npossession of firearm \u2013  which is a Grade B supervised release violation under USSG \n\u00a77B1.1(a)(2)  with a  statutory maximum of five years .  See USSG \u00a77B1.1(a)(2 ) and \napplication note 5.     \n \n \n18 \n consider factor \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) (\u201c to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote \nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d) when imp osing \na supervised release sentence.   See 18 USC \u00a73583(e) specifically omitting \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) as a factor to be considered.   \nPetitioner argued that the appropriate statutory construction requires the \nconclusion that a revocation court may appropriately sanction a violator for his \nbreach of trust, and may consider the specifically  enumerated factors in \u00a73583(e).  \nHowever, a revocation court may not punish the defendant for the new criminal \nconduct underlying the revocation.  See United States v. Hammons , 558 F.3d 1100, \n1104 (9th Cir. 2009) quoting  United States v. Miqbel , 444 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir. \n2006); See also United States v. Crudup, 461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir. 2006)(\u201cin \ndevising a revocation sentence the district court is not authorized to consid er\u201d \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A)); United States v. Simtob ,  485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007)(court \nmay not impose revocation sentence solely or even primarily on the new criminal \noffense underlying the revocation).  But see, United States v. Lewis , 498 F.3d 393, \n399-400 (6th Cir. 2007) ( holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to \nconsider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for violation of supervised \nrelease, even though this factor is not enumerated in \u00a73583(e).\u201d); and see United \nStates v. Williams , 443 F.3d 35, 47 (2nd Cir. 2006)(court interpreted \u00a73583(e) as \nrequiring consideration of enumerated \u00a73553(a) factors without forbidding \nconsideration of other pertinent factors including \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)).     \n \n19 \n The purpose of supervised release it to help reintegrate the offender into \nsociety upon release from prison, not to extend punishment for the offense.  It \nfollows that a revocation sentence should focus on the personal characteristics of the \noffender, not on the greater universe of considerations impli cated by \u00a73553(a)(2)(A)).  \nPetitioner  urges this Court adopt the interpretation of the Ninth Fifth and \nFourth Circuits that a court\u2019s consideration of factors in revocation of supervised \nrelease is limited to those factors specifically listed in \u00a73583(e).  Appellant asks \nthat this Court adopt the position of the Ninth , Fifth and Fourth Circuit that it is \nimpermissible to consider \u00a73553(a)(2)(A) when sentencing a defendant for \nsupervised release violations.   \nSupport for this interpretation is also found in different sect ions of \u00a73583: (1) \n\u00a73553(a)(2)(A) is also specifically omitted from the factors the court is to consider \nunder \u00a73583(c) when including a term of supervised release at the time of original \nsentencing; (2) \u00a73583(d) permits a court to order further conditions  of supervised \nrelease but limits the scope of additional factors to be considered and excludes \nspecifically \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  See Title 18 USC 3583.  \nThe district court\u2019s stated reason for the sentence impermissibly weighted \nconsideration of the \u00a73553(a)(2 )(A) punishment factor : \u201cTo reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the \noffense\u2026\u2026the Court includes that a statutory sentence is sufficient but not greater \nthan necessary in this case.\u201d    Not only did the district court consider \n \n20 \n 3553(a)(2)(A) as a factor in sentencing, Petitioner argued the record supported the \nconclusion that the district court gave this impermissible factor disproportionately \nmore weig ht than the other factors recited.   \nPetitioner argued to the First Circuit that t he prohibited factor construction \nof \u00a73583(e) is reinforced by the policy statements of USSG Chapter 7, Res olution of \nMajor Issues  and the Commission \u2019s adoption of the first approach \u2013  breach of trust \nfor violating supervised release, not punishment for the new criminal conduct .  The \nCommission explain ed that it debated two different approaches to sanctioning \nviolations of probation and supervised release , ultimately choosing the first \napproach as the appropriate approach to sanctioning violations of supervised \nrelease.   See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).    \nThe first approach focused on treating violations of  court -imposed  conditions \nas a \u201cbreach of trust .\u201d The \u201cnature of the conduct leading to revocation could be \nconsidered in measuring the extent of the breach of trust .\u201d However, punishment for \nany new criminal conduct would be left \u201cto the court responsible  for imposing \nsentence for that offense.\u201d See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).      \nThe second  approach focused on \u201c sanctioning  violators for the particular \nconduct triggering the revocation as if that conduct were being sentenced as new \ncriminal conduct.\u201d    See USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b).  \n Petitioner argued to the First Circuit that he Commission \u2019s adopt ion of  the \nfirst approach  \u2013 sanction for breach of trust not the new criminal conduct  \u2013 supports \n \n21 \n Petitioner\u2019s argument that the omission of 18 USC \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) was intended to \nbe a prohibition of considering the punishment factor when determining the \nappropriate sentence for a supervised release revocation under 18 USC \u00a7 3583(e).  \nSee USSG Chapter 7, Part A, (3) (b) , 18 USC \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and 18 US C \u00a7 3583(e)  \n Petitioner argued that the record from the sentencing court supported the \nconclusion that the sentencing court punished Petitioner  for the new criminal \nconduct , even though Petitioner was being prosecuted in a separate parallel new \ncriminal ac tion for the same new criminal conduct triggering the revocation of \nsupervised release. The other violation, Petitioner argued, was a failure to report \nviolation that would not justify the statutory maximum sentence imposed by the \nsentencing court .   \nThe F irst Circuit rejected this argument and held instead that 18 USC \u00a7 \n3553(a)(2)(A) was a permissible factor even though it is omitted from the 18 USC \u00a7 \n3583(e) list of factors.  Ruling that the list of factors is merely a recommendation \nnot a mandate, and th e sentence imposed was substantively reasonable.  \nPetitioner argued that the sentencing court  punished Petitioner  for the new \ncriminal conduct  rather than sanctioning Petitioner for his breach of trust.  The \nFirst Circuit rejected this argument  and determi ned at the abuse of discretion \nstandard that the 500% upward variant sentence was substantively reasonable \neven though the Petitioner faced a lengthy sentence for the same new criminal \nconduct in the parallel prosecution to be served consecutively to the r evocation \n \n22 \n sentence.   \nIn deciding Petitioner\u2019s case, t he First Circuit  opinion results in a conclu sion \nthat Petitioner believes is inconsistent with statutory l aw; i.e., that a sentencing \ncourt may punish a defendant f or the new criminal conduct that serves as a basis \nfor supervised release even though defendant is si multaneous ly prosecuted and \npunished for same sa id conduct  in a par allel criminal prosecution.   \nPetitioner believes the First Circuit erred in its treatment Title 18 USC \n\u00a73583(e) as simply requires consideration of the enumerated subsections without \nforbidding consideration of other sen tencing factors that are omitted  from the \nenumeration .  \n   \nII. The question whether the Due Process Clause of the United States \nConstitution requires a revocat ion defendant be granted an opportunity to \nrequest discovery, and be granted sufficient time to receive review \ndiscovery, before the Title 18 USC \u00a7 3583(e) Supervised Release \nRevocation Hearing, is an important question of federal statutory and \nconstitutio nal law affecting other defendants that has not been but should \nbe addressed by this Court.  \n \nIn the case below, in his Main Brief and Reply Brief the Petitioner further \nargued that the district court erred in denying the Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Continue \nand Motion for discovery in violation of the Petitioners right to Due Process.  \nThe First Circuit ruled th at Petitioner \u2019s Due Process rights were not violated \nby the district court \u2019s denial of Petitioner \u2019s Motion f or Disco very and Motio n to \ncontinue . \n \n23 \n Petitioner requests this Court grant w rit of certiorari to address this issue \nand the First Circuit\u2019s ruling, because it raises an  important question of federal  \nconstitutional and federal statutory law affecting other defendants  that has not \nbeen, but should be, addressed by this Court ; and is an important question of \nfederal statutory law affecting other defendants.  Supreme Court Rules, Rule 10 \nPetitioner  argued  to the first circuit that the district court \u2019s denial of \nPetitioner \u2019s Motion for Discovery  and Motion to Continue violated Petitioner \u2019s \nright to Due Process as embodied in Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule \n32.1. Revocation of supervised release proceedings are governed by  Federal Rules \nof Criminal Procedure, Rule 32.1.  The Supreme Court has held that due process \nrequires that revocation proceedings be conducted according to principles of \nfundamental fairness. See Gagnon v. Scarpelli , 411 US 778, 782 (1973 ); Morrissey  \nv. Brewer, 408 US 471 (1972); See also, F. R. Crim. P., Rule 32.1(b)(2).  By \ndenying Appellants  Motion  to Continue until after the new criminal action was \ncompleted, and the Motion for Discovery, the court effectively denied the \nPetitioner  the opportunity to defend himself and offer potentially mitigating or \nexculpatory evidence  that may be gleaned from discovery and/or from a \ncontinuance to permit the prosecution for the new criminal conduct to unfold.    \nCombined with the court\u2019s refusal to have evidence offered in the record that \n \n24 \n demonstrated the firearm was not fully automatic, the process did not adhere to the \nguarantee of fundame ntal fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause and F. R. \nCrim. P., Rule 32.1.   \nThe First Circuit rejected this argument and ruled that the Petitioner failed \nto demonstrat e plain error. United S tates v. Tanco -Pizarro, US CA, First Circuit, \nCase No. 15 -2388, Opinion pages 11- 12, Appendix  A pages 12- 14.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \n For the reasons set forth above, Petitioner Rafael Tanco -Pizarro  respectfully \nprays that the Court grant a writ of certiorari , vacate the judgment of the court of \nappeals and remand the case for further review.  \n \n \nDated, the  10th day of September 2018,    \n       \n     Respectfully Submitted,  \n  \n \n \n \n   /s/ Gail M.

United States on Feb. 25, 2025. The oral arguments centered around what factors can be used in cases that revoke supervised release. (Photo by Jeremy Fredricks/MNS) WASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court justices heard arguments Tuesday on which factors courts can consider when revoking supervised release for criminal defendants when not all possible factors are explicitly listed under federal law. Supervised release is when someone follows strict conditions after they have finished their sentence from federal prison, unlike parole, which releases someone early on good behavior. The case was brought by Edgardo Esteras, who served 27 months in federal prison for drug trafficking related convictions before starting a six-year supervised release in Ohio in 2020. However, in 2023 a compliance check uncovered a firearm, violating Esteras\u2019 release terms and leading to his arrest. At his revocation hearing, Judge Benita Pearson described Esteras\u2019s behavior as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and sentenced Esteras to an additional two years in prison and three more years of supervised release after that. At the core of Esteras v. United States is whether judges like Pearson can consider factors such as the seriousness of the offense and promoting respect for the law when revoking supervised release, even though those factors aren\u2019t explicitly listed in the law Congress wrote. Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, federal courts can impose supervised release for those convicted of federal crimes. This means that after serving a prison sentence, individuals remain under court supervision as they transition back into society. During this time, they must follow specific conditions set by a judge, and violations could result in additional prison time. Comparably, parole, which allows early release from prison for good behavior, lets judges consider factors like the seriousness of the original crime, respect for the law, and just punishment when handling violations. However, while the Sentencing Reform Act requires judges to weigh these factors during initial sentencing, the Act omits them for supervised release violations. The Supreme Court is weighing whether judges can consider the seriousness of the original crime when deciding if someone should return to prison for violating supervised release since supervised release is not meant to further punish someone but to rehabilitate. \u201cIf you violate your parole, you have done a morally wrong thing\u2026we put some faith in you, we let you out early,\u201d said Jacob Schuman, a law professor at Temple University who wrote an amicus brief in support of Esteras. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t apply to supervised release. Nobody did you any favors by giving you supervised release. You haven\u2019t done anything morally wrong.\u201d This issue has divided nine of the U.S. Circuit appellate courts. Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the Sixth Circuit, in his majority opinion, wrote that the statute does not limit judges to only the enumerated factors, granting discretion in considering broader judicial principles, including deterrence and community safety. Four additional circuits ruled similarly, while four others sided with Esteras. Masha Hansford, arguing for the government, said judges should have the option\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to consider factors like the seriousness of the offense, respect for the law, and just punishment. She compared it to a college allowing students to take extra courses beyond the required prerequisites for declaring a major. 19,418 people violated the terms of their supervised release in 2021, which is about 30% of all people on supervised release, according to the U.S. Courts. Brooklyn Law School Professor Cynthia Godsoe said a judge\u2019s job is to interpret and apply laws, not create new rules or expand their powers beyond what the law permits. \u201cWhat we argued in the amicus brief is judges overstepping their role to impose these sentences,\u201d Godsoe said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not incarcerated, you\u2019re still under supervision.\u201d Godsoe\u2019s bottom line: Congress deliberately omitted factors regarding what judges can and can\u2019t consider regarding supervised release revocation. Justice Neil Gorsuch approached the issue from a \u201clinguistic perspective,\u201d arguing that the statute\u2019s language did not explicitly prohibit judges from considering additional factors. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it quite goes so far to say you must not consider other factors,\u201d he said, noting the statute\u2019s absence of a clear \u201cmust-not\u201d clause. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Esteras, it will standardize the factors judges can consider when revoking supervised release, ensuring they adhere strictly to those explicitly listed in federal law. Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern about the practical implications of restricting judicial considerations during supervised release revocation hearings. \u201cHow is the judge going to consider the nature and circumstances of that offense without considering the severity of the offense?\u201d Alito asked.

First, a deep and outcome-determinative circuit split, which has been substantiated with concrete evidence (the *Leaks* case, the \"smoking gun\" quote from a district judge) to counter the government's claim that the split is \"illusory.\" Second, a newly introduced constitutional avoidance argument, which elevates the case's importance by suggesting the government's interpretation could violate due process, jury trial rights (*Haymond*), and the Double Jeopardy Clause (*Gamble*).\n    *   **Government's Case Against Cert:** The government's primary remaining argument is that the Supreme Court has repeatedly denied certiorari on this exact statutory question in the past, suggesting a lack of institutional will to resolve it.\n\n*   **Solidified Central Conflict & Prediction Focus:** The synthesis of the briefing has clarified that the cert decision will almost certainly turn on a single, well-defined conflict: **Does the petitioner's compelling demonstration of a deep, practical circuit split, now amplified by a significant constitutional avoidance argument, provide a \"special and important reason\" sufficient to overcome the Court's documented history of denying review on this issue?** My task-level uncertainty is no longer about the content of the arguments, but about the resolution of this specific dynamic.

In this instance, understanding the general question of *how the Court weighs a strong new case for cert against a history of denials* (D) is the best path to predicting the outcome for *Esteras* (\u03b8).\n    *   **New Meta-Heuristic: \"Phase Shift Recognition.\"** My process must explicitly recognize when the nature of the task shifts. I have clearly moved from the **\"Argument Extraction Phase\"** (where the best sources are primary documents like briefs) to the **\"Predictive Modeling Phase\"** (where the best sources are likely to be secondary analyses like legal scholarship, empirical studies of the Court, and expert commentary from SCOTUS-watchers). Recognizing this shift is critical for selecting the correct information-gathering tools for the next step.\n    *   **Refined Meta-Level Question (Enhanced Specificity):** My guiding research question has become significantly more precise and actionable. It has evolved from a general query into a highly specific hypothesis to be tested: *How does the Supreme Court's calculus for granting certiorari change when a petition concerning a previously-denied issue (1) presents new evidence of a split's practical, outcome-determinative effects and (2) introduces a plausible constitutional avoidance argument not strongly pressed in prior petitions?* This level of specificity will allow for much more targeted and effective research.

The question of certiorari is no longer a prediction but a resolved fact, fundamentally shifting the focus of my analysis to the merits of the case.\n\n*   **Certiorari Granted & Case Consolidated:** The central conflict of the cert-stage analysis has been resolved. The Supreme Court **granted certiorari on October 21, 2024**. My analysis that the petitioner's arguments\u2014a deep, practical circuit split amplified by a constitutional avoidance claim\u2014were sufficiently compelling to overcome the Court's history of denial has been proven correct. The case has been consolidated with two other Sixth Circuit cases, *Jaimez* and *Leaks*, and is proceeding as *Esteras et al. v. United States*. This confirms the significance of the issue and the petitioner's success in framing it.\n\n*   **Shift to Merits Analysis & New Evidence:** The task has fully transitioned from predicting a cert grant to predicting the final ruling on the merits. I now have initial, highly valuable evidence from the oral arguments held on February 25, 2025:\n    *   **Justice Gorsuch** raised a \"linguistic\" or textualist point, noting the statute lacks a clear \"must-not\" clause, suggesting that if Congress did not explicitly prohibit the consideration of other factors, they might be permissible.\n    *   **Justice Alito** raised a practical concern, questioning how a judge could realistically evaluate the \"nature and circumstances\" of a violation without also considering its \"severity,\" implying the factors are inherently intertwined.\n    *   These questions from two key justices provide the first signals of the Court's thinking on the merits, and both appear to lean towards the government's position that the statutory list in \u00a7 3583(e) is a non-exclusive floor, not a prohibitive ceiling.\n\n*   **New Central Conflict (Merits Stage):** The core predictive challenge is now to determine how the Court will resolve the clash between two competing interpretive methods. The conflict is no longer about getting the Court's attention, but about the statutory interpretation itself: **Will the petitioner's structural argument (that Congress's specific enumeration and omission of factors in \u00a7 3583(e) was a deliberate prohibition, under the *expressio unius* canon) and \"breach of trust\" theory prevail over a textualist/pragmatic reading (favored by Gorsuch and Alito's questions) that the list is a non-exhaustive set of mandatory considerations?**\n\n*   **Updated Prediction Confidence:** While the petitioner was successful at the cert stage, the initial signals from oral arguments have lowered my confidence in their ultimate success on the merits. The government's argument appears to be resonating with at least two justices. My uncertainty is now focused on how the rest of the Court will weigh these competing arguments.",

The previous synthesis led to a clear plan, which was executed with the search action, leading to this new, transformative observation.\n    *   **\"The D-to-\u03b8 Bridge\":** This strategy was spectacularly successful. By abstracting the specific task uncertainty (Will *Esteras* get cert?) into a general design-level question (How does SCOTUS handle cert petitions for previously-denied issues when new arguments are raised?), I formulated a search query that directly uncovered the dispositive outcome. This proves that researching general patterns of judicial behavior is a highly efficient path to resolving specific case uncertainties.\n    *   **\"Phase Shift Recognition\":** My explicit recognition of the shift from the \"Argument Extraction Phase\" to the \"Predictive Modeling Phase\" was critical. It correctly guided me to prioritize \"metadocuments\" like news reports over primary briefs. This choice was directly responsible for finding the cert grant and oral argument summaries, confirming that source prioritization must adapt to the task phase.\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Outcome-First Search.\"** When a task phase concludes with a discrete, public event (like a cert decision or oral argument), the most efficient information-gathering action is to search directly for the outcome of that event. While my complex query worked, a simpler query like \"Esteras v. United States certiorari grant\" would have been even more direct. This is a valuable efficiency refinement.\n    *   **Source Reliability Confirmed (High Value):**\n        *   **Legal News Outlets (e.g., Law360):** Proven to be of the highest value for tracking case status and outcomes. They provide factual, timely, and dispositive information.\n        *   **SCOTUS-Watching Press (e.g., Medill on the Hill):** Invaluable for the \"Predictive Modeling Phase.\" Summaries of oral arguments, including specific questions from justices, are among the most powerful signals available for predicting a merits outcome.\n        *   **Historical Court Filings (e.g., *Tanco-Pizarro* petition):** Extremely useful for contextualizing the legal landscape. The 2018 petition provided concrete evidence for the \"history of denial\" argument, confirming the background against which the *Esteras* petition succeeded.\n    *   **Refined Meta-Level Question (Merits Stage):** My guiding research question has evolved to reflect the new central conflict. The next step requires a deeper dive into judicial philosophy: ***In statutory interpretation cases, how does the Supreme Court typically balance the *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* canon against textualist arguments that a statutory list is a non-exclusive floor, particularly when pragmatic judicial administration concerns (like those raised by Justice Alito) are involved?*** Answering this D-level question is now the most effective way to refine my \u03b8-level prediction for the final outcome of *Esteras*."

My beliefs remain stable regarding the facts of the case but are now more structured around a specific information-gathering goal.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The procedural posture is confirmed: certiorari was **granted on October 21, 2024**, and the case was consolidated with *Jaimez* and *Leaks* to proceed as *Esteras et al. v. United States*. Oral arguments were held on February 25, 2025. This confirms the task has definitively shifted from a cert-stage prediction to a merits-stage prediction.\n\n*   **Initial Merits Signals (Stable):** The most potent evidence so far comes from the initial summary of oral arguments. Questions from **Justice Gorsuch** (focusing on the lack of an explicit prohibition in the statute) and **Justice Alito** (highlighting the practical difficulty of separating a violation's \"nature\" from its \"severity\") suggest a leaning towards the government's position. This has lowered my confidence in a win for the petitioner.\n\n*   **Crystallized Central Conflict (Refined):** The core of the case is the interpretive battle over 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The conflict is between:\n    1.  **Petitioner's Argument:** A structuralist reading, relying on the *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* canon (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other). Congress deliberately listed specific factors for revocation sentencing and omitted the punitive factors from \u00a7 3553(a), therefore judges are prohibited from considering them.\n    2.  **Government's Argument:** A textualist/pragmatic reading. The list in \u00a7 3583(e) is a non-exclusive floor of required considerations, not a prohibitive ceiling. Since Congress did not write a \"must-not\" clause, and because it's practically difficult to separate the factors, judges are permitted to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\n\n*   **Defined Predictive Uncertainty (New):** My internal reasoning has clarified that while I have signals from two justices, my primary task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) is the disposition of the other seven. A confident prediction requires understanding how the full Court, particularly its swing justices and those with different interpretive philosophies, will weigh the structuralist canon against the pragmatic and textualist counterarguments.

In this instance, my reflection concluded that the **full oral argument transcript** is vastly more valuable than merits briefs or secondary articles at this stage, as it provides the most direct, comprehensive, and timely signal of the entire Court's thinking. This heuristic prioritizes depth of signal over breadth of information immediately following a phase shift.\n    *   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Refined):** My belief in the value of different sources is becoming more nuanced and phase-dependent:\n        *   **Phase 1 (Cert Stage):** Petitions, circuit court opinions, and historical dockets are paramount.\n        *   **Phase 2 (Post-Cert / Pre-Argument):** Merits briefs from petitioner, respondent, and amici curiae are most valuable.\n        *   **Phase 3 (Post-Argument):** The **oral argument transcript** becomes the single most valuable document, superseding even the briefs, as it reflects the justices' real-time engagement with the arguments they have read.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's substance remains stable, but this observation highlights a practical barrier to resolving my primary uncertainty. The attempt to gather new evidence has failed, leaving my predictive model unchanged but my information-gathering path in need of revision.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The case *Esteras et al. v. United States* (consolidated from *Esteras*, *Jaimez*, and *Leaks*) is at the merits stage. Certiorari was granted on October 21, 2024, and oral arguments were held on February 25, 2025.\n*   **Initial Merits Signals (Stable):** My belief that the government has a strong position is unchanged. This is based on initial summaries indicating that Justice Gorsuch questioned the petitioner's argument from statutory silence, and Justice Alito noted the practical difficulty of separating the \"nature\" of a supervised release violation from its \"seriousness,\" which aligns with the government's pragmatic argument.\n*   **Crystallized Central Conflict (Stable):** The legal question remains a contest between two interpretive approaches to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e):\n    1.  **Petitioner's Structuralist Argument:** The canon *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* implies that by listing specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors to consider, Congress implicitly prohibited courts from considering the unlisted punitive factors.\n    2.  **Government's Textualist/Pragmatic Argument:** The list in \u00a7 3583(e) is a non-exclusive floor of considerations. Without an explicit prohibition, and given the practical overlap between factors, judges are permitted to consider the full scope of \u00a7 3553(a).\n*   **Defined Predictive Uncertainty (Unresolved):** My primary task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) remains the disposition of the seven justices whose views were not captured in the initial summary. My plan to resolve this by analyzing the full oral argument transcript has been stalled. The search for the transcript within the docket files was unsuccessful. This means the significant information gap I previously identified persists, and my confidence in any specific outcome cannot increase until I find a way to access these signals.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful lesson in the practical limitations of my tools and the need for methodological flexibility. A failed search is not a dead end; it is a rich source of information about how to design better experiments (i.e., better searches).\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan\":** This cycle remains essential. The failed search forces a re-evaluation of the \"Plan\" phase. The plan \"acquire the transcript\" is too simple; it must now become \"find a *workable method* to acquire the transcript.\"\n    *   **\"The D-to-\u03b8 Bridge\":** The strategy of connecting task uncertainty to a general research question remains valid. The question of how the Court balances *expressio unius* against pragmatic textualism is still the correct one to pursue.\n    *   **\"Phase Shift Recognition\":** This heuristic correctly identified the post-argument phase and the key evidence needed. The failure was in execution, not in the initial strategic assessment.\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Acquisition\" (Refined):** This heuristic correctly identified the oral argument transcript as the highest-value information source. However, this observation refines the heuristic by adding a crucial corollary: identifying the target is only half the battle. The heuristic must now include a sub-process for troubleshooting the *method of acquisition*. The value of the target justifies spending effort on finding the right way to access it.\n    *   **New Heuristic: \"Methodological Iteration.\"** A failed information-gathering action is an experimental result that informs the next action. When a search for a high-value target fails, the immediate response should not be to abandon the target, but to iterate on the *method*. This involves systematically changing one variable at a time: the query terms, the search type, the filters, or the tool itself. This failure teaches me to debug my own search process.\n    *   **Tool-Use Refinement (`CLOSED_SEARCH`):** My belief in the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool is now more nuanced. It is not a magical \"find anything\" function. Its failure to find the transcript with `search_type: 'docket_files'` suggests several possibilities: 1) the file is not yet uploaded, 2) the file exists under a different name or metadata tag, or 3) this `search_type` is inappropriate for transcripts. This tool requires precise and potentially iterative use to be effective.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable but with Access Caveats):**\n    *   The hierarchy itself remains correct: post-argument, the transcript is the most valuable document.\n    *   This observation adds a practical layer: the *theoretical* value of a source is useless without a reliable *method of access*. My design process must now account for the potential difficulty of acquiring a source, even if its value is known to be high."

Success would validate the 'Methodological Iteration' heuristic (i.e., broaden a failed search before abandoning the query). Failure would also be informative, falsifying the hypothesis and forcing a more sophisticated model of the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool's behavior. Either outcome provides a significant lesson in effective information acquisition strategy, thus yielding high design-level gain.\n\nJoint EIG (1.7): The action is powerful because it simultaneously pursues the most critical task-level goal while testing a core design-level strategy.

Thank you \nall for standing. Please feel free to retake your seats.\nCounsel for the United States, will you please \nintroduce yourself for the record?\nMR. JOYCE: Good afternoon, Your Honor. Chris \nJoyce appearing on behalf of the United States.\nTHE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Joyce.\nCounsel for the defendant, will you kindly introduce \nboth yourself and your client for the record?\nMR. GROSTIC: Good afternoon, Your Honor. \nChristian Grostic on behalf of Mr. Esteras, who is seated \nnext to me at defense table.\nTHE COURT: Good afternoon to you both.\nAnd I\u2019d like to welcome you as well, Mr. Zakrajsek, \nas the representative from the Office of Pretrial \nServices and Probation. Thank you for your assistance \nin supervising Mr. Esteras, and also -- \u201cEsteras,\u201d pardon \nthe mispronunciation -- your willingness to assist Court \nand counsel throughout today\u2019s hearing. \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: Thank you, Your Honor.\n[4]THE COURT: This hearing has been scheduled \nto allow me to take up the alleged violations of your term \nof supervised release, Mr. Esteras. The reports I have \nreviewed in preparation for today\u2019s hearing are several. \nAnd I\u2019d like to check with you, Counsel, to make sure that \nyou have the same reports that I have. And I will start \nfrom that earlier -- earliest issued this year.\nI issued a warrant for Mr. Esteras\u2019s arrest pursuant \nto a January 23rd, 2023 report.\nDo you have it, Mr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Have you had enough time to review it?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I have. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Do you also have it, Defense Counsel?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\nAfter the arrest of Mr. Esteras, he was before \nMagistrate Judge Knapp for a detention hearing. She \nordered that he be detained. Mr. Esteras has asked that I \nreview that detention ruling. I did review it, and I ordered \nthat he persist in detention until today\u2019s hearing.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nAdditionally, I have been informed by Mr. Zakrajsek \nthat one of the allegations of violation of Mr. Esteras\u2019s \nterm of supervised release has been resolved, I\u2019ll use that \nterm, in state court. And to help with this [5]reason for \ntoday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Joyce, I am drawing your attention \nto the January 30th report, issued this year, 2023.\nDo you have it?\nMR. JOYCE: I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you can see there are two alleged \nviolations, correct, new law violation and possession of a \nfirearm?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I can see that.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, do you also have that one?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Great. Thank you.\nSo then walking us full forward -- to my knowledge, if \nthere is something more, Mr. Zakrajsek will tell us -- to the \nsupplemental information report dated the 14th of March.\nThis report is the one I referred to when I am informed \nthat the domestic violence charge, criminal damaging and \naggravated menacing were dismissed by the Youngstown \nMunicipal Court, and Mr. Zakrajsek\u2019s report indicates \u201cat \nthe request of the victim.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n5a\nDo you have it, Mr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you as well, Mr. Grostic?\n[6]MR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: So we\u2019re here because there have been \ntwo allegations of the violation of Mr. Esteras\u2019s term \nof supervised release. If you are looking for the most \ncomprehensive report, I suggest it be the January 30th, \n2023 report that not only speaks to both the allegations \nof violation, it also speaks to the sentencing options.\nIt does have one piece of good news in it, and that \nis that despite the suspension of the GED requirement, \nMr. Esteras, you earned your GED. I am proud of you \nfor doing that.\nAnd, of course, the guidelines provisions are outlined \nas part of the sentencing options.\nWith that, I understand that counsel would like to \nspeak to me. You have my attention.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor. And may I ask, \njust to inquire for the sake of clarity, is the matter that \nyou are referring to what we approached your staff about, \nan issue that has arisen prior to the hearing we wanted \nto make the Court aware of? Is that what the Court is \nreferring to?\n\nAppendix A\n6a\nTHE COURT: That is the only message I have \nreceived. If there is something more, you will probably \nhave to tell me about that as well.\nMR. JOYCE: Understood. Your Honor, shortly before \nwe entered the courtroom here this afternoon, both [7]\nMr. Grostic, counsel for the defendant, and myself were \nsurprised to see that the alleged victim in the Youngstown \nPolice Department report of January 23rd, 2023, that \nbecame the subject of the violation report that the Court \nhas referenced, she is present here today. And both Mr. \nGrostic and I have had an opportunity to speak with her.\nIt is my understanding that she wishes to make a \nstatement to the Court. And I anticipate, based on what \nshe told me, and in my conference with Mr. Grostic, what \nshe told him, that this is going to be different than the \nstatement she gave to the police.\nAnd so it was my concern, as it was Mr. Grostic\u2019s \nconcern, that if she did that, she might implicate herself in \nsome way. And so we wondered if it would be appropriate \nfor her to have counsel appointed to represent her to \ndiscuss with her the possible consequences of that action.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Joyce. I have \nunderstood you.\nIs that the same topic you approached my staff about, \nMr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n7a\nTHE COURT: All right. Just to be clear,\nMr. Joyce, I understood you to say that the victim, \ninitials MI, correct?\nMR. JOYCE: Correct, Your Honor.\n[8]THE COURT: Would like to make a statement. \nDoes that mean that you nor your colleague on the other \nside intend to call her as a witness so that she can testify \nunder oath?\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, I did not intend \nto call her, because much of her statement is captured \non the body cam that I was going to present to the \nCourt today as evidenced through the officer from the \nYoungstown Police Department.\nIt was my understanding, based on the attachment to \nthe motion filed by counsel for the defendant, to reinstate \na bond -- or pardon me, to revoke the detention order. \nLooking at that docket entry he attached, I saw that she \nhad come to the municipal court, and at her request, asked \nthese charges be dismissed. And so because of that, it was \nmy -- I was not intending to call her, because I believed I \ncould establish the violations through the body cam. So I \nwas not intending to call her.\nAnd now having spoken with her, I would tell the \nCourt that I don\u2019t intend to call her because I don\u2019t know \nthat I could put her on the stand unsure that she is going \nto say something that is true or untrue. And so if I can\u2019t \n\nAppendix A\n8a\nvouch for her credibility, as an officer of the court, I \nwouldn\u2019t put her up. That\u2019s my position.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n[9]MR. JOYCE: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: I agree. Suborning perjury is to be \navoided, right?\nMR. JOYCE: Absolutely.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, do you have a different \nidea of employing the victim? Did you intend to call her?\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, after speaking with her \ntoday, I did then intend to call her. I did not until I had \nspoken with her today.\nTHE COURT: So you intend to call her still?\nMR. GROSTIC: I do.\nTHE COURT: Then I don\u2019t know what the issue is. \nWe all know this is a Rule -- it is a preliminary hearing. \nIt falls under Rule of Evidence 104(a). Rules of Evidence \nare suspended.\nUnless she testifies as a witness called by one side or \nthe other, there will be no statements made to the Court. \nShe is not the victim of this case. The United States is \nthe victim of the allegations that allege Mr. Esteras has \nviolated his term of supervision.\n\nAppendix A\n9a\nThe victim would be the victim of the conspiracy to \ndistribute heroin, and it\u2019s everyone within the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio or abroad. She\u2019s a victim of the case that\u2019s \nbeen dismissed, so she has no standing. I am not obligated \nby rules that govern allocution to hear from her. [10]And \nI won\u2019t. I don\u2019t. I hear from counsel. I hear from victims. \nI hear from the defendant.\nSo she won\u2019t speak to me unless one of you calls her \nas a witness, she is placed under oath, and she will testify \nunder penalties of perjury.\nSo, Mr. Grostic, I leave it to you to assess, if you believe \nshe\u2019s going to perjure herself, she will be committing a \ncrime in this very court. And what we do about that will \nremain to be seen.\nI can tell you that I would err on the side of doing \nwhat you think is best for your client, but I won\u2019t pause \nand hire counsel for her, because she has no standing in \nthis room other than some member of the public that the \ndefense team might believe suitable to impart evidence. \nYou might do just as well by making a proffer if you have \nany concerns.\nI will leave that to you, along with your client, to \ndecide. Fair enough?\nMR. GROSTIC: Understood, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you\u2019ll have some time, because \nthe government will go first.\n\nAppendix A\n10a\nWith that, I have pointed to you -- pointed out to you \nmy belief that the January 30th, 2023 report is the most \ncomprehensive in terms of consequences, if I find that \nMr. Esteras has violated his term of supervised release \nby [11]either committing a new law violation or possession \nof a weapon.\nI would like to add one more thing to the record, and \nthen ask the defense team how you\u2019d like to proceed.\nThe one other thing I\u2019d like to add to the record, it \nis really an amplification of something written by Mr. \nZakrajsek at the bottom of page 3 of the January 30th, 2023 \nreport. He appropriately references -- it\u2019s the paragraph, \neveryone, that starts \u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3583(g),\u201d and \nhe\u2019s correct that \u201crevocation of supervision and a sentence \nof imprisonment is mandatory for a defendant found to be \nin possession of a controlled substance,\u201d and then he goes \non, \u201cpossession of a firearm.\u201d\nAnd the only amplification I would like to make, that is \na correct summary of 3583(g), but when you read verbatim \nthe language, it becomes even more palpable what the \nlaw requires of the Court under circumstances where a \ndefendant possesses a firearm.\nIt reads as follows: 3583(g), I am reading from (g)\n(1), \u201cIf the defendant possesses a firearm,\u201d and it goes \non to say, \u201cas such term is defined in Section 921 of this \ntitle, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violates a \ncondition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant \nfrom possessing a firearm.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n11a\nI point that out needlessly, because I am sure I [12]\nhave astute counsel before me. I needn\u2019t find that Mr. \nEsteras has committed the new law violation to find that \nhe possessed a firearm.\nI have consulted the judgment and commitment order \nissued on the 11th of September, 2018. The tenth standard \ncondition states, \u201cYou must not own, possess, or have \naccess to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or \ndangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was designed or \nwas modified for the specific purpose of causing bodily \ninjury or death to another person, such as numbchucks \nor tasers).\u201d\nI make that finding by a preponderance of the \nevidence. I employ 3583(g).\nSo, Mr. Joyce, keep in mind, I will accept what \npresentation of evidence is necessary, but what I do, and \nboth -- as we know from the work sheet Mr. Zakrajsek \ngenerously provided, starting at page 1 of the attachment \nto the January 30th report -- both possession of a firearm \nand new law violation are Grade C offenses. Neither is \nmore significant in the eyes of the Court to the other.\nThe last point along those lines that I would like to \nmake is -- one perhaps I\u2019ll hold for later. Let me pause \nthere and ask, do you have any questions about the \namplification of page 3 of the January 30th, 2023 report, \nMr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: No, Your Honor. Thank you.\n\nAppendix A\n12a\n[13]THE COURT: Mr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic and Mr. Esteras, the \ndiscussion we should have now is how you\u2019d like to proceed. \nAs you know, Mr. Esteras has available to him full due \nprocess as outlined in Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1. \nThat allows for many things, including the full presentation \nof evidence. Meaning that the government would present \nwhat evidence it would choose to persuade the Court that \nMr. Esteras has indeed violated his term of supervised \nrelease. That often includes, although it need not always, \nthe testimony of his supervising officer, any proffer, video \ncam evidence as Mr. Joyce has admitted. Mr. Esteras has \nthe right to cross-examine, confront that evidence. And \nto present his own evidence, including his own testimony, \nshould he choose to do that.\nSometimes, not in every case, but occasionally the \ndefendant waives full Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1 due \nprocess and admits one or both of the violations. I simply \nwant to know how your client would like to proceed today.\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would ask \nfor a hearing on both violations.\nTHE COURT: Denying both violations, sir?\nMR. GROSTIC: That\u2019s correct.\n\nAppendix A\n13a\nTHE COURT: With that, let me just further [14]\noutline, I will hear evidence; and then I will allow \nallocution/argument, which will sort of be your summary \nof the evidence and allocution at one time; and then I\u2019ll, of \ncourse, hear allocution from Mr. Esteras; and I\u2019ll make \nmy rulings and impose consequences.\nMr. Joyce, are you prepared to begin?\nMR. JOYCE: I am prepared, yes. Thank you, Your \nHonor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. How would you like to \nbegin?\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, the government \nwould call Robert DiMaiolo from the Youngstown Police \nDepartment as its first witness.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Will you retrieve your \nwitness?\nMR. JOYCE: Certainly.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, sir. Please approach to be \nsworn.\nTHE CLERK: Please raise your right hand.\nROBERT DiMAIOLO, of lawful age, a witness called \nby the United States, being first duly sworn, was examined \nand testified as follows:\n\nAppendix A\n14a\nTHE COURT: Now, if you\u2019d kindly walk around and \ntake the seat next to mine. Thank you, sir. Make yourself \ncomfortable there. The microphone is adjustable.\n[15]THE WITNESS: Okay.\nTHE COURT: When you\u2019re ready, you may examine \nthe witness.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor. And forgive me \nfor not making this motion prior to actually calling the \nwitness, but I would move for a separation of witnesses.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. And what are you asking \nin that vein? I don\u2019t see anyone else in the room who might \nbe a witness other than an officer of the court.\nMR. JOYCE: Yes. Nobody else is in the room at \npresent. I understand there are -- based on what we heard \nfrom defense counsel, there are witnesses in the hall \noutside who may at some point wander into the courtroom \nand overhear testimony. I thought it appropriate if they \nremain separated while Officer DiMaiolo testifies.\nTHE COURT: Certainly. No one will be admitted in \nthe room.\nAre you concerned also about witnesses who are \noutside of the room conversing with one another?\nMR. JOYCE: No. I am less concerned about that, \nYour Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n15a\nTHE COURT: Okay. You just don\u2019t want anyone \nto walk in while your witness is under direct or cross-\nexamination?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, exactly right.\n[16]THE COURT: Thank you. Will you assist?\nNo objection, is there, Mr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\n(Pause.)\nTHE COURT: Thank you, sir.\nYou may begin when you\u2019re ready.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nDIRECT EXAMINATION OF ROBERT DiMAIOLO\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer, would you please state your name, spell \nyour last name for the record?\nA. Robert C.

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson us\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

PEARSON1\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nSUPERVISED RELEASE VIOLATION HEARING \nAND SENTENCING\n\nAppendix A\n2a\n[3]PROCEEDINGS\nTHE CLERK: The matter before the Court is Case \nNumber 4:14-cr-425, the United States of America versus \nDefendant Number 10, Edgardo Esteras.\nTHE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you \nall for standing. Please feel free to retake your seats.\nCounsel for the United States, will you please \nintroduce yourself for the record?\nMR. JOYCE: Good afternoon, Your Honor. Chris \nJoyce appearing on behalf of the United States.\nTHE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Joyce.\nCounsel for the defendant, will you kindly introduce \nboth yourself and your client for the record?\nMR. GROSTIC: Good afternoon, Your Honor. \nChristian Grostic on behalf of Mr. Esteras, who is seated \nnext to me at defense table.\nTHE COURT: Good afternoon to you both.\nAnd I\u2019d like to welcome you as well, Mr. Zakrajsek, \nas the representative from the Office of Pretrial \nServices and Probation. Thank you for your assistance \nin supervising Mr. Esteras, and also -- \u201cEsteras,\u201d pardon \nthe mispronunciation -- your willingness to assist Court \nand counsel throughout today\u2019s hearing. \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: Thank you, Your Honor.\n[4]THE COURT: This hearing has been scheduled \nto allow me to take up the alleged violations of your term \nof supervised release, Mr. Esteras. The reports I have \nreviewed in preparation for today\u2019s hearing are several. \nAnd I\u2019d like to check with you, Counsel, to make sure that \nyou have the same reports that I have. And I will start \nfrom that earlier -- earliest issued this year.\nI issued a warrant for Mr. Esteras\u2019s arrest pursuant \nto a January 23rd, 2023 report.\nDo you have it, Mr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Have you had enough time to review it?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I have. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Do you also have it, Defense Counsel?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\nAfter the arrest of Mr. Esteras, he was before \nMagistrate Judge Knapp for a detention hearing. She \nordered that he be detained. Mr. Esteras has asked that I \nreview that detention ruling. I did review it, and I ordered \nthat he persist in detention until today\u2019s hearing.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nAdditionally, I have been informed by Mr. Zakrajsek \nthat one of the allegations of violation of Mr. Esteras\u2019s \nterm of supervised release has been resolved, I\u2019ll use that \nterm, in state court. And to help with this [5]reason for \ntoday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Joyce, I am drawing your attention \nto the January 30th report, issued this year, 2023.\nDo you have it?\nMR. JOYCE: I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you can see there are two alleged \nviolations, correct, new law violation and possession of a \nfirearm?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I can see that.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, do you also have that one?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Great. Thank you.\nSo then walking us full forward -- to my knowledge, if \nthere is something more, Mr. Zakrajsek will tell us -- to the \nsupplemental information report dated the 14th of March.\nThis report is the one I referred to when I am informed \nthat the domestic violence charge, criminal damaging and \naggravated menacing were dismissed by the Youngstown \nMunicipal Court, and Mr. Zakrajsek\u2019s report indicates \u201cat \nthe request of the victim.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n5a\nDo you have it, Mr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you as well, Mr. Grostic?\n[6]MR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: So we\u2019re here because there have been \ntwo allegations of the violation of Mr. Esteras\u2019s term \nof supervised release. If you are looking for the most \ncomprehensive report, I suggest it be the January 30th, \n2023 report that not only speaks to both the allegations \nof violation, it also speaks to the sentencing options.\nIt does have one piece of good news in it, and that \nis that despite the suspension of the GED requirement, \nMr. Esteras, you earned your GED. I am proud of you \nfor doing that.\nAnd, of course, the guidelines provisions are outlined \nas part of the sentencing options.\nWith that, I understand that counsel would like to \nspeak to me. You have my attention.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor. And may I ask, \njust to inquire for the sake of clarity, is the matter that \nyou are referring to what we approached your staff about, \nan issue that has arisen prior to the hearing we wanted \nto make the Court aware of? Is that what the Court is \nreferring to?\n\nAppendix A\n6a\nTHE COURT: That is the only message I have \nreceived. If there is something more, you will probably \nhave to tell me about that as well.\nMR. JOYCE: Understood. Your Honor, shortly before \nwe entered the courtroom here this afternoon, both [7]\nMr. Grostic, counsel for the defendant, and myself were \nsurprised to see that the alleged victim in the Youngstown \nPolice Department report of January 23rd, 2023, that \nbecame the subject of the violation report that the Court \nhas referenced, she is present here today. And both Mr. \nGrostic and I have had an opportunity to speak with her.\nIt is my understanding that she wishes to make a \nstatement to the Court. And I anticipate, based on what \nshe told me, and in my conference with Mr. Grostic, what \nshe told him, that this is going to be different than the \nstatement she gave to the police.\nAnd so it was my concern, as it was Mr. Grostic\u2019s \nconcern, that if she did that, she might implicate herself in \nsome way. And so we wondered if it would be appropriate \nfor her to have counsel appointed to represent her to \ndiscuss with her the possible consequences of that action.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Joyce. I have \nunderstood you.\nIs that the same topic you approached my staff about, \nMr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n7a\nTHE COURT: All right. Just to be clear,\nMr. Joyce, I understood you to say that the victim, \ninitials MI, correct?\nMR. JOYCE: Correct, Your Honor.\n[8]THE COURT: Would like to make a statement. \nDoes that mean that you nor your colleague on the other \nside intend to call her as a witness so that she can testify \nunder oath?\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, I did not intend \nto call her, because much of her statement is captured \non the body cam that I was going to present to the \nCourt today as evidenced through the officer from the \nYoungstown Police Department.\nIt was my understanding, based on the attachment to \nthe motion filed by counsel for the defendant, to reinstate \na bond -- or pardon me, to revoke the detention order. \nLooking at that docket entry he attached, I saw that she \nhad come to the municipal court, and at her request, asked \nthese charges be dismissed. And so because of that, it was \nmy -- I was not intending to call her, because I believed I \ncould establish the violations through the body cam. So I \nwas not intending to call her.\nAnd now having spoken with her, I would tell the \nCourt that I don\u2019t intend to call her because I don\u2019t know \nthat I could put her on the stand unsure that she is going \nto say something that is true or untrue. And so if I can\u2019t \n\nAppendix A\n8a\nvouch for her credibility, as an officer of the court, I \nwouldn\u2019t put her up. That\u2019s my position.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n[9]MR. JOYCE: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: I agree. Suborning perjury is to be \navoided, right?\nMR. JOYCE: Absolutely.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, do you have a different \nidea of employing the victim? Did you intend to call her?\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, after speaking with her \ntoday, I did then intend to call her. I did not until I had \nspoken with her today.\nTHE COURT: So you intend to call her still?\nMR. GROSTIC: I do.\nTHE COURT: Then I don\u2019t know what the issue is. \nWe all know this is a Rule -- it is a preliminary hearing. \nIt falls under Rule of Evidence 104(a). Rules of Evidence \nare suspended.\nUnless she testifies as a witness called by one side or \nthe other, there will be no statements made to the Court. \nShe is not the victim of this case. The United States is \nthe victim of the allegations that allege Mr. Esteras has \nviolated his term of supervision.\n\nAppendix A\n9a\nThe victim would be the victim of the conspiracy to \ndistribute heroin, and it\u2019s everyone within the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio or abroad. She\u2019s a victim of the case that\u2019s \nbeen dismissed, so she has no standing. I am not obligated \nby rules that govern allocution to hear from her. [10]And \nI won\u2019t. I don\u2019t. I hear from counsel. I hear from victims. \nI hear from the defendant.\nSo she won\u2019t speak to me unless one of you calls her \nas a witness, she is placed under oath, and she will testify \nunder penalties of perjury.\nSo, Mr. Grostic, I leave it to you to assess, if you believe \nshe\u2019s going to perjure herself, she will be committing a \ncrime in this very court. And what we do about that will \nremain to be seen.\nI can tell you that I would err on the side of doing \nwhat you think is best for your client, but I won\u2019t pause \nand hire counsel for her, because she has no standing in \nthis room other than some member of the public that the \ndefense team might believe suitable to impart evidence. \nYou might do just as well by making a proffer if you have \nany concerns.\nI will leave that to you, along with your client, to \ndecide. Fair enough?\nMR. GROSTIC: Understood, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you\u2019ll have some time, because \nthe government will go first.\n\nAppendix A\n10a\nWith that, I have pointed to you -- pointed out to you \nmy belief that the January 30th, 2023 report is the most \ncomprehensive in terms of consequences, if I find that \nMr. Esteras has violated his term of supervised release \nby [11]either committing a new law violation or possession \nof a weapon.\nI would like to add one more thing to the record, and \nthen ask the defense team how you\u2019d like to proceed.\nThe one other thing I\u2019d like to add to the record, it \nis really an amplification of something written by Mr. \nZakrajsek at the bottom of page 3 of the January 30th, 2023 \nreport. He appropriately references -- it\u2019s the paragraph, \neveryone, that starts \u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3583(g),\u201d and \nhe\u2019s correct that \u201crevocation of supervision and a sentence \nof imprisonment is mandatory for a defendant found to be \nin possession of a controlled substance,\u201d and then he goes \non, \u201cpossession of a firearm.\u201d\nAnd the only amplification I would like to make, that is \na correct summary of 3583(g), but when you read verbatim \nthe language, it becomes even more palpable what the \nlaw requires of the Court under circumstances where a \ndefendant possesses a firearm.\nIt reads as follows: 3583(g), I am reading from (g)\n(1), \u201cIf the defendant possesses a firearm,\u201d and it goes \non to say, \u201cas such term is defined in Section 921 of this \ntitle, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise violates a \ncondition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant \nfrom possessing a firearm.\u201d\n\nAppendix A\n11a\nI point that out needlessly, because I am sure I [12]\nhave astute counsel before me. I needn\u2019t find that Mr. \nEsteras has committed the new law violation to find that \nhe possessed a firearm.\nI have consulted the judgment and commitment order \nissued on the 11th of September, 2018. The tenth standard \ncondition states, \u201cYou must not own, possess, or have \naccess to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or \ndangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was designed or \nwas modified for the specific purpose of causing bodily \ninjury or death to another person, such as numbchucks \nor tasers).\u201d\nI make that finding by a preponderance of the \nevidence. I employ 3583(g).\nSo, Mr. Joyce, keep in mind, I will accept what \npresentation of evidence is necessary, but what I do, and \nboth -- as we know from the work sheet Mr. Zakrajsek \ngenerously provided, starting at page 1 of the attachment \nto the January 30th report -- both possession of a firearm \nand new law violation are Grade C offenses. Neither is \nmore significant in the eyes of the Court to the other.\nThe last point along those lines that I would like to \nmake is -- one perhaps I\u2019ll hold for later. Let me pause \nthere and ask, do you have any questions about the \namplification of page 3 of the January 30th, 2023 report, \nMr. Joyce?\nMR. JOYCE: No, Your Honor. Thank you.\n\nAppendix A\n12a\n[13]THE COURT: Mr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic and Mr. Esteras, the \ndiscussion we should have now is how you\u2019d like to proceed. \nAs you know, Mr. Esteras has available to him full due \nprocess as outlined in Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1. \nThat allows for many things, including the full presentation \nof evidence. Meaning that the government would present \nwhat evidence it would choose to persuade the Court that \nMr. Esteras has indeed violated his term of supervised \nrelease. That often includes, although it need not always, \nthe testimony of his supervising officer, any proffer, video \ncam evidence as Mr. Joyce has admitted. Mr. Esteras has \nthe right to cross-examine, confront that evidence. And \nto present his own evidence, including his own testimony, \nshould he choose to do that.\nSometimes, not in every case, but occasionally the \ndefendant waives full Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1 due \nprocess and admits one or both of the violations. I simply \nwant to know how your client would like to proceed today.\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would ask \nfor a hearing on both violations.\nTHE COURT: Denying both violations, sir?\nMR. GROSTIC: That\u2019s correct.\n\nAppendix A\n13a\nTHE COURT: With that, let me just further [14]\noutline, I will hear evidence; and then I will allow \nallocution/argument, which will sort of be your summary \nof the evidence and allocution at one time; and then I\u2019ll, of \ncourse, hear allocution from Mr. Esteras; and I\u2019ll make \nmy rulings and impose consequences.\nMr. Joyce, are you prepared to begin?\nMR. JOYCE: I am prepared, yes. Thank you, Your \nHonor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. How would you like to \nbegin?\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, the government \nwould call Robert DiMaiolo from the Youngstown Police \nDepartment as its first witness.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Will you retrieve your \nwitness?\nMR. JOYCE: Certainly.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, sir. Please approach to be \nsworn.\nTHE CLERK: Please raise your right hand.\nROBERT DiMAIOLO, of lawful age, a witness called \nby the United States, being first duly sworn, was examined \nand testified as follows:\n\nAppendix A\n14a\nTHE COURT: Now, if you\u2019d kindly walk around and \ntake the seat next to mine. Thank you, sir. Make yourself \ncomfortable there. The microphone is adjustable.\n[15]THE WITNESS: Okay.\nTHE COURT: When you\u2019re ready, you may examine \nthe witness.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor. And forgive me \nfor not making this motion prior to actually calling the \nwitness, but I would move for a separation of witnesses.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. And what are you asking \nin that vein? I don\u2019t see anyone else in the room who might \nbe a witness other than an officer of the court.\nMR. JOYCE: Yes. Nobody else is in the room at \npresent. I understand there are -- based on what we heard \nfrom defense counsel, there are witnesses in the hall \noutside who may at some point wander into the courtroom \nand overhear testimony. I thought it appropriate if they \nremain separated while Officer DiMaiolo testifies.\nTHE COURT: Certainly. No one will be admitted in \nthe room.\nAre you concerned also about witnesses who are \noutside of the room conversing with one another?\nMR. JOYCE: No. I am less concerned about that, \nYour Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n15a\nTHE COURT: Okay. You just don\u2019t want anyone \nto walk in while your witness is under direct or cross-\nexamination?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, exactly right.\n[16]THE COURT: Thank you. Will you assist?\nNo objection, is there, Mr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\n(Pause.)\nTHE COURT: Thank you, sir.\nYou may begin when you\u2019re ready.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nDIRECT EXAMINATION OF ROBERT DiMAIOLO\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer, would you please state your name, spell \nyour last name for the record?\nA. Robert C.

She was sitting at the \nkitchen table, and he came in, he punched her in the head, \nscreamed at her a little bit, punched the TV, which he [23]\nbroke, and walked outside. And at that point she followed \nhim outside and saw her car, which was the one that was \nabandoned in the roadway, and he was getting into it, and \nshe grabbed the keys from him, and she started to walk \nback and he pulled out a handgun, and she retreated back \ninto the house and then he fired three rounds into her auto.\nQ. All right. Can you describe her demeanor when you \nfirst spoke with her?\nA. She was scared, as well as her kids.\nQ. You eventually spoke to her children as well?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. Did that come later?\nA. Yes.\n\nAppendix A\n25a\nQ. All right. So focusing on your first interaction with \nher, it was just the two of you on the outside of the house; \nis that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. You said she was scared?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How do you describe somebody who is scared? \nWhat about her made you feel that that was how she felt?\nA. The fact that she called on her child\u2019s father, and \nthen she was -- she was -- she was pretty afraid that he \nwas going to come back and do it again.\nQ. All right. Did you observe anything like tears or\n[24]anything like that?\nA. No, she wasn\u2019t crying, no.\nQ. Now, after you spoke with her in front of the \nresidence, did she show you the damage to her vehicle?\nA. Yes. She showed me the damage, and we walked \ninside. Since it was cold out, we went inside and did the \nreport, and other officers arrived.\nQ. All right. But you were the first one on scene?\n\nAppendix A\n26a\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. Now, we\u2019ll talk about what happened \ninside as well. But at some point, did the person you \nidentified, did she show you where she believed her -- the \nfather of her children was standing at the time he fired \nthis weapon?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And can you describe for the Court where that was?\nA. It was right outside the vehicle that was left \nabandoned. And she stated that it was right near the door, \nright near the door of the auto, the driver\u2019s side.\nQ. You said that car was in the roadway parked the \nwrong way, right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was it in front of the driveway?\nA. Yes, blocking the driveway.\nQ. Blocking the driveway. All right.\nDid you have an opportunity to look around in the \narea [25]where it had been explained to you the person \nwas standing when they fired this weapon, did you look \naround on the ground at all?\n\nAppendix A\n27a\nA. Yes. I looked around, and I found a casing.\nQ. All right. When you say --\nA. A spent casing.\nQ. Explain to the Court what a \u201cspent casing\u201d is, \nplease.\nA. It\u2019s a casing that was ejected from the handgun \nafter it was fired.\nQ. All right. So certainly suggestive that a firearm \nhad been discharged there?\nA. Yes. And due to the snowfall, it was fresh right on \ntop of the snow.\nQ. So by that you mean it was not covered in falling \nsnow?\nA. No.\nQ. No, you don\u2019t mean that?\nA. It wasn\u2019t covered in falling snow.\nQ. Thank you for clarifying.\nAll right. And in this interaction with the female you \nhave described, did she identify by name the father of her \nchildren that had perpetrated these acts?\n\nAppendix A\n28a\nA. Yes.\nQ. What was the name she had given?\nA. I cannot pronounce his last name.\nQ. All right. Can you make an attempt at it or spell it, \n[26]an attempt at spelling it?\nA. No.\nQ. Okay. Is your recollection as to his name -- is there \nsomething that I could present you with that would refresh \nyour recollection as to his name?\nA. My report.\nMR. JOYCE: All right. Your Honor, may I approach \nthe witness and present him his report?\nTHE COURT: You may, but just show Mr. Grostic \nwhat it is you\u2019ll show the witness.\nMR. JOYCE: Certainly, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. (Handing.)\n\nAppendix A\n29a\nTake a moment and look through that. And once you\u2019ve \nhad a moment, let me know when you are ready for me \nto proceed.\nA. I\u2019m ready.\nQ. All right. Having looked at the document that I \nhave handed you, what was the name that the --\nA. Edgardo Esteras.\nQ. Edgardo Esteras. All right. Thank you.\nNow, what I have handed you, since you are already \nholding it, has it been marked already?\nA. Yes.\n[27]Q. As Government\u2019s Exhibit 1?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And you recognize that document?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And what is it that I have handed you?\nA. This is my PD2, my report, incident report.\nQ. From the events that took place --\n\nAppendix A\n30a\nA. Yes.\nQ. -- on the night you\u2019re talking about?\nAll right. It appears to be a true and accurate copy of \nthe report as you remember drafting it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. Now, you said that --\nTHE COURT: Mr. Joyce, sorry for the interruption. \nDo you have a copy for me?\nTHE WITNESS: She can -- I am fine with this now.\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t want to take it from you. I do \nhave the attachment to Mr. Esteras\u2019s motion to revoke \ndetention order. Is it --\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: Your Honor, if I may. I have \na copy I can provide the Court if you would like.\nTHE COURT: Would you like me to have that?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes. It is the very same report.\nTHE COURT: Would you retrieve it from Officer \nZakrajsek, make sure it is what you would like me to \nhave, [28]and show it to Mr. Grostic? And that way Officer \nDiMaiolo will be able to keep his own.\n\nAppendix A\n31a\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, I would mention to the \nCourt that this version of the report is just the first I think \nsix pages of what I believe is an eight-page document. And \nthe attachment that you referenced, Your Honor, to the \ndefense counsel\u2019s motion I believe is the full eight-page \ndocument. That\u2019s the very same as what I presented with \nthe witness. And I apologize for not having an extra copy.\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t mind using what\u2019s docketed as \nECF 426-1. It is an eight-page document.\nThank you, Officer. I will let you keep yours.\nNo objection to using what\u2019s already on the docket, \nright, Mr. Grostic?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. Thank you.\nMR. JOYCE: May I return it to him?\nTHE COURT: Please do.\nThank you, Officer. I appreciate it, but I will use this.\nTHE WITNESS: You\u2019re welcome, ma\u2019am.\nMR. JOYCE: May I inquire, Your Honor?\nTHE COURT: Please do.\n\nAppendix A\n32a\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you.\nBY MR. JOYCE:\n[29]Q. All right. Officer DiMaiolo --\nA. Yes.\nQ. -- you said previously that at some point you entered \nthe home of the female. When you entered the home, how \nmany people would you estimate were present?\nA. There were approximately eight to ten people inside \nthe residence.\nQ. All right. And where in the home were they located \nbased on --\nA. Inside the living room, right inside the residence.\nQ. All right. And did you have a chance to interview \neach and every one of them?\nA. I interviewed two of them.\nQ. Okay. And generally, based on your discussion \nwith the complainant, as well as the two people you just \ninterviewed, who were these people? Did you gain a \ngeneral sense?\nA. I know it was the victim, her two daughters, which \nare Mr. Esteras\u2019s daughters, one of his cousins, a female, \n\nAppendix A\n33a\nand there were random -- there was one male and a couple \nother females there that I have no idea who they were.\nQ. Okay. But family and friends of the alleged victim?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. When you went into the home, what, if \nanything, did you observe?\nA. I observed, it would be the television to the east \nside [30]of the living room was destroyed.\nQ. Okay. How would you characterize the destruction \nto it?\nA. As it was punched or something. The whole glass \nwas all broken on the front of it.\nQ. Was the TV on?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And while you were speaking with the \nalleged victim or the complainant, that\u2019s where you made \nyour -- filled out your full report?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Okay. All right. Did she describe to you any injuries \nthat she had sustained?\n\nAppendix A\n34a\nA. No.\nQ. All right. Did she -- did you offer her medical \nassistance should she need it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And she denied that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. But she did maintain that she was struck \nby the defendant?\nA. Yes. And she filled out a PD6, which is a domestic \nviolence form.\nQ. All right. Is that a form that you had provided to \nher?\n[31]A. Yes.\nQ. All right. And did you collect that form from her?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And did you leave a copy with her?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. You said that you had spoken to the \nchildren, two children that were present in the home. \nWhat did you learn from them?\n\nAppendix A\n35a\nA. I basically heard most of them saying the same \nstory that happened, and that this isn\u2019t the first time that \nhe\u2019s assaulted her or done damage to the residence.\nQ. Okay. Did you ask her at any point if there was any \nreason she could identify that this might have happened?\nA. Yes, I did ask her if it was over a man maybe being \nin the house or something, and she just laughed and said, \n\u201cNo, he just does this regularly.\u201d\nQ. All right. So really she couldn\u2019t offer an explanation \nas to why he entered the home to do this?\nA. No.\nQ. All right. And was that sentiment echoed by any of \nthe other people you interviewed on scene?\nA. No.\nQ. No, they said something different than she had \nsaid?\nA. Nobody said anything different, they all said the \nsame.\nQ. They said the same thing?\n[32]A. Yes.\nQ. All right. Thank you for clarifying what was \nprobably a confusing question.\n\nAppendix A\n36a\nAll right. I am going to back up a little bit. You talked \nabout the vehicle, that it was reported to you that Mr. \nEsteras had arrived in a vehicle that remained on scene. \nDid you inquire about where he had gone if the vehicle he \ncame in was still there?\nA. Yes. I asked how he left, and there was a female \nthat was sitting on the couch, and she stated that he -- that \nshe is Mr. Edgardo\u2019s cousin, and that he took her vehicle, \nwhich you could see the tire prints in the driveway, that \nhe went through the neighbor\u2019s yard to exit.\nQ. Okay. And did you inquire as to how he gained \naccess to her vehicle?\nA. She said it was left running, it was a rental.\nQ. Okay. So her -- the vehicle that he left in had been on \nand running in the driveway at the time he went to leave?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And you said that there were tracks \nthrough the neighbor\u2019s yard?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Tire tracks from the vehicle that had recently left?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And did these appear to you to be fresh \n[33]tracks?\n\nAppendix A\n37a\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And why is it -- based on what you could \nobserve, why is it that that vehicle had to drive through \nthe yard in order to --\nA. Because the auto that he drove up in was blocking \nit in the driveway, so he couldn\u2019t back out, he had to back \nup a little bit and then do a U-turn to get out.\nQ. All right. And the tracks you saw were consistent \nwith that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. You said that at some point you were \nassisted by other officers; is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Are you aware if any of the officers who were there \nassisting you took photographs of the scene?\nA. Yes, Detective Sergeant Skowron did.\nQ. All right. And have you had an opportunity to look \nat the photographs that he took?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And are they true and accurate depictions \nof the scene as you recall it the night of January the 23rd, \n2023?\n\nAppendix A\n38a\nA. Yes.\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, may I approach the [34]\nwitness? I would like to present him with Government\u2019s \nExhibits 2, 3 and 4. These are all photographs. I will, of \ncourse, show them to defense counsel first. And I will note \nwith an apology that the officer brought these photographs \nto me today, and I do not have copies of them because he \nbrought me these physical copies when he arrived here \nin court today.\nTHE COURT: Sure. But I\u2019d like to alter your \nsuggestion a bit. Of course, show Mr. Grostic. But then \nturn on the document camera, and then you can show all \nof us at one time. All right with you?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes, certainly. A great suggestion. \nThank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: But do show your colleague on the \nother side.\nThe on/off switch is towards the back. Your hand is \nnear it. Yes, exactly. It should work, and you should be \nable to manipulate, focus as you need.\nMR. JOYCE: All right. Is that visible to the Court, \nYour Honor.\nTHE COURT: It is. Thank you.\nMR. JOYCE: Certainly.\n\nAppendix A\n39a\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer DiMaiolo, can you see what\u2019s on the screen \nin front of you there, sir?\n[35]A. No. I can see it on her screen, though. It\u2019s not \non this one. I can see it on that one over there.\nTHE COURT: Oh, forgive me. I should --\nTHE WITNESS: That\u2019s okay. There we go. I can see \nit now.\nTHE COURT: Deputy, is your screen on? Do you \nmind turning it on in the event -- Mr. Zakrajsek, yours \nshould be on now.\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: It is, Your Honor. Thank \nyou.\nTHE COURT: Thank you for saying that.\nTHE WITNESS: You\u2019re welcome, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Yours is working?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: Please proceed, Mr. Joyce.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n40a\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. You are able to see the document in front of you, sir?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. It\u2019s marked as Government\u2019s Exhibit 2 in the \nbottom corner?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. All right. Do you recognize this?\nA. That is a spent casing that Officer Bell found.\nQ. All right. Thank you.\nAnd I\u2019m going to gesture with my hand. You tell me if \n[36]I\u2019m in the correct spot. Is this area where I am circling, \nis this the spent shell casing that you are referencing?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And I apologize, it looks, because of the glossy \nquality of the photo, there\u2019s a little bit of a glare on the -- \nfrom the light produced by the projector. But you\u2019re still \nable to recognize that?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. And that\u2019s the casing you found on scene?\n\nAppendix A\n41a\nA. Yeah. Officer Bell found it while I was doing the \nreport.\nQ. All right. Thank you.\nI would like to present Government\u2019s Exhibit 3.\nAre you able to see that document?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And it\u2019s marked Government\u2019s Exhibit \n3. What is this?\nA. It\u2019s a bullet hole in the hood of the auto.\nQ. All right. There\u2019s a -- the bottom half of the screen \n-- for purposes of the record, I will make these statements. \nThe bottom half of the screen is mostly white and there\u2019s \na black mark there towards the top, or middle left part \nof the screen.\nIs that the bullet hole that you observed?\nA. Yes.\n[37]Q. And while it might not be visible because of \nthe quality of the photograph, did you observe any other \nbullet holes in this vehicle?\nA. Yes. There was one in the windshield. It\u2019s hard to \ntell with the glare. And then there\u2019s one in the front grill.\n\nAppendix A\n42a\nQ. Okay. Thank you very much.\nI am going to present you with Government\u2019s Exhibit \n4.\nDo you recognize that?\nA. Yes, there\u2019s -- yes.\nQ. All right. And what is that?\nA. There\u2019s a bullet hole right underneath the front \ngrill, and you still can\u2019t see the one in the windshield, but \nthere is one.\nQ. Okay. This is a zoomed-out version, I will say, of \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibit 3; is that right?\nA. Yes.\nQ. It\u2019s the same vehicle pictured in both Government\u2019s \nExhibits 3 and 4?\nA. Yes.\nQ. I can show you Government\u2019s Exhibit 3 again if \nyou --\nA. It\u2019s the same.\nQ. It\u2019s the same. All right.\n\nAppendix A\n43a\nAnd all these pictures are true and accurate depictions \nof what you observed that night?\n[38]A. Yes.\nQ. Officer DiMaiolo, are you -- in all your work with \nthe Youngstown Police Department, have you become \nfamiliar with the odor of alcohol on a person?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. That\u2019s something you\u2019ve been taught to \ndetect as you interact with citizens?\nA. Yes.\nQ. On the night in question here, were you able to \ndiscern any alcoholic odor from Ms. Infante?\nA. No.\nQ. Did she indicate in any way or give, I don\u2019t know, \nsymptoms of impairment?\nA. No.\nQ. All right. And that\u2019s something you\u2019ve been trained \nto identify?\nA. Yes.\n\nAppendix A\n44a\nQ. All right. Did she appear to you to be intoxicated?\nA. No.\nQ. All right. At the time that you responded to the call \nfor service at 1137 Inverness, were you outfitted with an \naudio and video recording device?\nA. Yeah, with a body-worn camera, yes.\nQ. Are you aware if it was operational that evening?\nA. Yes.\n[39]Q. Are you aware because audio and video was, in \nfact, captured by that device?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. And are you aware of the receipt and \nstorage procedures at the Youngstown Police Department?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know if those procedures were followed in \nthis case?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Have you had an opportunity to take a look at the \nbody cam you recorded that evening?\n\nAppendix A\n45a\nA. Yes.\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, with the Court\u2019s permission, \nI would seek to play what will be marked as Government\u2019s \nExhibit 5. I can represent to you, Your Honor, that this \nvideo has been shared with counsel for the defendant prior \nto the hearing. I confirmed with him also telephonically \nyesterday and told him I would be playing it, and I made \nhim aware of that as well.\nTHE COURT: Thank you for doing that.\nHow will you play it, from a laptop?\nMR. JOYCE: Yes. I have set it up already, if the Court \nwould be so kind as to switch it.\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\n(Video played.)\n[40]MR. JOYCE: Your Honor, for purposes of the \nrecord, I would note that I stopped the video at 23 minutes, \n42 seconds. The balance is just the officer getting back \ninto his vehicle and nothing of substance or relevance to \nthe case, is my recollection.\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer, do you recall the balance of the video? Is \nthere anything of substance on there?\n\nAppendix A\n46a\nA. No. I usually just get in my auto and shut it off right \nthen to do the report.\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, we\u2019re offering the entirety \nof the exhibit for the purposes of the hearing, but just in \nthe interest of time, I will stop it there, unless there is \nobjection from the Court or counsel for the defendant.\nMR. GROSTIC: No objection.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Grostic. I am satisfied \nwith what you\u2019ve presented, Mr. Joyce.\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, then I\u2019ll just \nwrap up very quickly.\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer, you were able to see and hear the audio and \nvideo that was just presented?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And was that, in fact, your body camera recording?\n[41]A. Yes, that was me.\nQ. And that\u2019s a true and accurate depiction of the \nevents that occurred that evening?\nA. Yes.\n\nAppendix A\n47a\nQ. This is not adulterated or changed in any way?\nA. No.\nQ. All right. Thank you.\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, I have no additional \nquestions for this witness.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\nOfficer DiMaiolo is passed for cross-examination.\nCROSS-EXAMINATION OF ROBERT DIMAIOLO \nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. Good afternoon, Officer.\nA. Good afternoon.\nQ. I am sorry. I am going to try to speak up because \nI\u2019ve got a little frog in my throat, but can you hear me \nokay?\nA. Yes.\nQ. All right. Thank you.\nI believe in your direct, you said something about you \ndidn\u2019t detect any alcohol odor or any inebriation?\n\nAppendix A\n48a\nA. No.\nQ. As we were watching the video, I noticed there\u2019s \nkind of two different timestamps, but the timestamp in \nthe upper right, about 22:50, someone says, \u201cIt smells like \na good [42]time in here.\u201d\nDo you recall that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know what that was referring to?\nA. It had to be marijuana.\nQ. Okay. So you did smell marijuana?\nA. Yes. But she was vaping, I saw.\nQ. Okay. Have you spoken to Ms. Infante since that \nnight?\nA. No.\nQ. Not at all?\nA. No.\nQ. Have you seen her at all, until today?\n\nAppendix A\n49a\nA. I didn\u2019t even know that was her at first.\nQ. Fair enough. Okay.\nSo to the best of your knowledge, except for maybe \nwhat I just told you, you haven\u2019t seen her or talked to her \nsince then?\nA. No.\nMR. GROSTIC: Could I have one moment, Your \nHonor?\nTHE COURT: You may.\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)\nMR. GROSTIC: No further questions. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Is there any redirect examination of \nOfficer DiMaiolo?\n[43]MR. JOYCE: Very, very briefly, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\n\nAppendix A\n50a\nREDIRECT EXAMINATION OF \nROBERT DIMAIOLO\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ. Officer, on cross-examination, you indicated that \nthe alleged victim was vaping. For the purposes of the \nrecord, what is that? What do you mean by that?\nA. It\u2019s just -- actually, I really don\u2019t know what vaping \nis. It\u2019s just a chemical that they use to smoke. It\u2019s not -- it \ndoesn\u2019t make you high or anything.\nQ. All right. But so based on what you observed, in \nyour interactions with her, she did not appear to be using \nmarijuana in front of you?\nA. No. It appeared that the other guys were, because \nwhen they asked them, they started giggling and laughing \nabout it.\nQ. Okay. But again, the alleged victim there, she \ndidn\u2019t exhibit any symptoms of being under the influence \nof marijuana?\nA. No.\nQ. And that\u2019s something you\u2019ve been trained to \nidentify?\nA. Yes.\n\nAppendix A\n51a\nMR. JOYCE: Okay. Nothing further, Your Honor.\nThank you very much.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n[44]Within the scope of that redirect, Mr. Grostic, is \nthere any recross-examination?\nMR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Is there any reason Officer DiMaiolo is \nnot able to leave the building if he should choose to do so?\nMR. JOYCE: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, sir, for appearing. You are \nfree to step down and leave the building.\nTHE WITNESS: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: On behalf of the United States, will \nyou call your next witness?\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you. Your Honor, pending \nadmission of Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 4, the \ngovernment would rest. I have no additional witnesses \nto call.\nTHE COURT: If you edit that to 1 through 5, I will \nask if there is any objection. Do you mind the edit?\n\nAppendix A\n52a\nMR. JOYCE: No. Thank you, Your Honor. I appreciate \nthat edit. In fact, it is five exhibits I intend to offer the \nCourt. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, at trial I would hold a \nseparate exhibits hearing. During this violation hearing, \nI will do it now. Is there an objection to any one of the \nexhibits?\n[45]MR. GROSTIC: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Then I will receive Government\u2019s \nExhibits 1 through 5.\nSubject to this opportunity to wrap up, the case \nturns to Mr. Esteras. Mr. Grostic, would you like to call \na witness?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Esteras would \nlike to call Ms. Melissa Infante.\nTHE COURT: And certainly I will allow you. I will \ncaution you, Mr. Grostic, as an officer of the court, that if \nyou believe she is going to perjure herself, that you have \na duty to avoid that when possible.\nDo you understand?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Would you like to speak with her? I \nwill make sure that I tell her that she\u2019ll open herself up \n\nAppendix A\n53a\nto punishment, new law violations, state or federal, for \npenalties, including perjury, making a false statement. \nUnder some circumstances I even include contempt. I\u2019m \nnot sure that that will be appropriate.\nBut with that caution made to you, and I\u2019ll repeat it \nto her, you may call your witness.\nMR. GROSTIC: Thank you, Your Honor. I will go out \ninto the hallway.\nTHE COURT: Please do. Thank you.\n[46]MR. GROSTIC: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Please approach to be sworn. Thank \nyou.\nTHE CLERK: Please raise your right hand.\nMELISSA INFANTE, of lawful age, a witness called \nby the Defendant, being first duly sworn, was examined \nand testified as follows:\nTHE COURT: Thank you. Now take the seat next \nto mine.\nMadam Court Reporter, did you capture exactly what \nmy assistant said as she swore the witness?\nTHE REPORTER: No, Judge.\n\nAppendix A\n54a\nTHE COURT: No? The record shall reflect, and you \ntell me if you believe differently, I think you are going \nto agree your name is Ms. Infante, that you have been \nordered to either swear or affirm. Did you hear that?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Do you know the difference?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: What is the difference?\nTHE WITNESS: You said swear?\nTHE COURT: Yes. I will tell you.\nTHE WITNESS: Okay.\nTHE COURT: It\u2019s either swear to the God of your \nchoosing, or affirm, meaning if you choose not to swear, \nyou [47]affirm. That\u2019s still a pledge that you\u2019re bound by \nthe oath you\u2019ve now taken. Clear?\nTHE WITNESS: Okay.\nTHE COURT: Ask the witness to please introduce \nherself for the record, and then I\u2019ll caution her.\nMR. GROSTIC: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix A\n55a\nDIRECT EXAMINATION OF MELISSA INFANTE \nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. Ms. Infante, could you state your name for the \nrecord and spell your last name?\nA. Melissa Infante, last name I-n-f-a-n-t-e.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Grostic.\nMs. Infante, I am Judge Pearson. There has been a \nconcern brought to my attention that you intend to testify \nand that your testimony might be impeachable, it might \nbe different from other statements you\u2019ve already made \nto law enforcement.\nAnd I just want you to know that should it be proven \nup at some time that while under the oath that you\u2019ve \njust taken by swearing and affirming that you will tell \nthe truth, you could expose yourself to new criminal law \nviolations, civil law violations, such as perjury, making \na false statement. You might even be charged with \nsomething along the lines of wasting the time of the \nYoungstown police if you say different today while under \noath that which we\u2019ve [48]already seen in a video recording \nmade on the 23rd of January, this year.\nI don\u2019t say these things to frighten you, but for you \nto understand that you don\u2019t have an obligation to make \nfalse statements. You only have an obligation to make \ntruthful statements.\n\nAppendix A\n56a\nIs that clear?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: All right. If at any time when you\u2019re \nquestioned by either Mr. Esteras\u2019s attorney, who awaits \nnow to question you, or the government\u2019s attorney, you may \nnot answer, and you may also plead the Fifth Amendment \nif you think that\u2019s an appropriate answer, because you \nbelieve your answer will cause legal problems for you.\nMake sense?\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: We\u2019ll take it question by question, Mr. \nGrostic, if you are comfortable with that.\nMR. GROSTIC: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. Ms. Infante, let me ask first, do you know the person \nI am pointing at, the defendant sitting at defense table?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And who is that?\n[49]A. The father of my kids, Edgardo Esteras.\n\nAppendix A\n57a\nQ. Okay.\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, could the record reflect \nthat the witness has identified the defendant?\nTHE COURT: Yes, sir, it shall reflect.\nMR. GROSTIC: Thank you.\nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. Now, Ms. Infante, I want to direct your attention \nto -- you may not know this date, but January 22nd, the \nnight of, into January 23rd.\nDo you remember that night by date?\nA. No.\nQ. Understood.\nDo you remember a time when Youngstown police \nofficers came to your home in late January of this year?\nA. No. I didn\u2019t call them, so I don\u2019t remember what \nwas the time.\nQ. Fair enough. I am going to state my question very \nprecisely.\nA. Okay.\n\nAppendix A\n58a\nQ. I\u2019d just ask you to listen carefully.\nDo you remember a time when Youngstown police \nofficers came to your house in --\nA. No.\nQ. -- January of this year?\n[50]A. I don\u2019t remember the time. It was nighttime. \nI don\u2019t --\nQ. I understand.\nA. But --\nQ. Let me try it completely differently.\nA. Do I remember the time?\nQ. No. Let me try and rephrase it completely.\nA. Oh.\nQ. That\u2019s my fault.\nA. Okay.\nQ. Do you remember that in January of this year, \nYoungstown police officers came to your house?\nA. Oh. Yes.\n\nAppendix A\n59a\nQ. Okay.\nA. Uh-huh.\nQ. Now we\u2019re on the same page.\nA. Okay.\nQ. And you\u2019ve already said you don\u2019t remember the \nexact time?\nA. No.\nQ. But do you remember them coming at nighttime?\nA. Yeah. It was dark.\nQ. It was dark. Was there snow on the ground?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Okay. Do you remember that night telling them \nthat [51]something had happened regarding Mr. Esteras?\nA. That we were arguing.\nQ. And again, I am just going to ask you to listen real \ncarefully.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember telling them anything about Mr. \nEsteras?\n\nAppendix A\n60a\nA. Yes.\nQ. Okay. Now, as the judge has already instructed \nyou, you are under an obligation to tell the truth. And I \nbelieve what the judge also told you is that you -- we are \naware that you\u2019ve made other statements to police before \ntonight -- before this afternoon.\nA. Yes.\nQ. Are you -- do you recall making statements to \npolice?\nA. I don\u2019t remember everything I spoke about, but --\nQ. Do you remember speaking with police, though, is \nmy question?\nA. Yeah. Yes.\nQ. Okay. So I am going to ask you a few questions about \nthings you may have told them or what you remember \nabout that night. Okay?\nA. Okay.\nQ. Okay. So when police arrived, do you remember \ntelling them that Mr. Esteras had come into your home?\n[52]A. Did they ask me that? Yeah, I told them he came \ninto the kitchen where I was sitting at.\n\nAppendix A\n61a\nQ. Okay. Do you remember telling them that he \npunched your TV?\nA. Did he punch it?\nQ. Well, my question is actually, do you remember \ntelling police --\nA. Telling them?\nQ. -- that he punched your TV?\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, I would rather you do \nthis differently. Your witness. But it might be nice if Ms. \nInfante knows that we\u2019ve seen a 23-minute video --\nTHE WITNESS: Uh-huh.\nTHE COURT: -- of you speaking with the police.\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\nTHE COURT: So whether she recalls what she said, \nthere is a video that I received into evidence. It\u2019s not been \nobjected to. So I really don\u2019t mind whether you recall or \nnot.\nTHE WITNESS: Uh-huh.\nTHE COURT: And I think that narrows the \npassageway for Ms. Infante to get herself into a legal \ncomplication.\n\nAppendix A\n62a\nSo do you mind taking into consideration the video, \nwhat it says? If you\u2019d like some parts of it to be [53]shown \nto her to see if she wants to respond differently. But we \nknow what\u2019s on that video. Right?\nMR. GROSTIC: Understood, Your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Keep that in mind, please.\nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. So, Ms. Infante, let me try a different approach.\nA. Okay.\nQ. What happened that night with Mr. Esteras?\nA. Okay. So I had called him -- we were arguing. I \nmean, we\u2019re always arguing. But I had called him to ask \nhim if he knows anything about what happened to my \ntruck.\nHe came to the house. We started arguing about it \nbecause he said, \u201cNobody better find out where we live \nat,\u201d being that my son has problems with other people \nout there.\nHe got mad at the fact that there was something \ndone to the truck. He helped me buy that truck. So I can \nunderstand why he was mad.\n\nAppendix A\n63a\nSo we were arguing inside about other things, \nincluding that. And he has a loud mouth, just like I do. \nHe was getting loud with me, so I started hitting him. I \npunched him in his mouth, and Edgardo started bleeding.\nThe kids were in the room sleeping, but my daughters \ncame out crying because they heard all the loud noise.\nAfter that, he tries to leave and all -- he tries to leave. \nAbout the TV, I can\u2019t even remember what happened to \n[54]it.\nHe goes outside. I left behind him. I realized that \nthey were in my other car that was actually at the shop \nsupposedly getting fixed. So since I realized that that was \nmy car, I took the keys and I ran right back inside with \nthe keys.\nEdgardo got in another car that was there in the \ndriveway and he left. I can\u2019t remember which way the car \nwas parked. I think it was facing the house. And then he \nwent through the grass and he left.\nBut we were arguing inside about what happened to \nthe -- to the car. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s him the whole entire \ntime, because we were arguing. But then I\u2019m thinking \nlike, could he have been capable of doing this, being that \nhe helped me get the car.\nQ. Well, let me stop you there, actually. I\u2019m not -- let \nme back up.\n\nAppendix A\n64a\nWhen you said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking this was him,\u201d what are \nyou referring to? You just described, if I\u2019m not mistaken, \nthat you were --\nA. What was done to the vehicle. What was done to \nthe vehicle, because the vehicle was --\nQ. Are you -- I am sorry.\nA. The vehicle -- I had pulled up -- I was gone. When I \npulled up there, my other two kids were there. And when I \n[55]seen my vehicle like that, I\u2019m like -- I\u2019m asking them, \n\u201cDo you guys know what happened to my car?\u201d\nQ. And let me pause. When you say \u201clike that,\u201d what \nare you referring to?\nA. With the -- with the hole on the windshield.\nQ. So you\u2019re referring to holes in the windshield?\nA. Uh-huh.\nQ. Okay.\nA. Yes.\nSo then my kids, they were acting like they didn\u2019t \nknow anything. They were acting like it could have been \n-- they were acting like they didn\u2019t know what happened.\nBut then, a few weeks later, I come to find out that that \nday my son was arguing with people who he had problems \n\nAppendix A\n65a\nwith before prior, which they did get to shoot up my mom\u2019s \nhouse, and there was a whole situation with that also. My \nson till this day still has problems --\nTHE COURT: Keep to the point. Control your \nwitness. What\u2019s the question?\nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. So let\u2019s come all the way back to, you noticed holes \nin your car?\nA. Uh-huh.\nQ. Okay. Did Edgardo shoot a gun into your car?\nA. I didn\u2019t see him do that. When I went outside and \n[56]noticed that he was in my other car with his friend, \nI grabbed the keys that were -- I don\u2019t know why he left \nthe keys there -- in the cup holder and I ran inside. And \nthat\u2019s when he\u2019s like, \u201cMelissa, give me the keys. Give me \nthe keys.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d\nQ. All right. So let\u2019s back up then.\nDid you see Mr. Esteras with a gun?\nA. No.\nQ. Did he threaten to kill you with a gun?\nA. Did he -- no.\n\nAppendix A\n66a\nQ. Did you -- why did you tell Youngstown police that \nhe did shoot at your car?\nA. Because I was mad.\nQ. Okay. So when the police arrived --\nA. Uh-huh.\nQ. -- you spoke with them, correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember everything you said?\nA. Not everything.\nQ. Okay. But you\u2019re aware that there is a video \nrecording of that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Have you watched that since then, that video \nrecording?\nA. When I was out there, I seen it on there, but that\u2019s \nit.\n[57]Q. Okay. Could you hear when you were --\nA. No.\n\nAppendix A\n67a\nMR. GROSTIC: Could I have one moment, Your \nHonor?\nTHE COURT: If you need it.\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)\nBY MR. GROSTIC:\nQ. Now, Ms. Infante, you\u2019re aware that the Youngstown \n-- in the Youngstown Municipal Court, Mr. Esteras was \ncharged with certain crimes, correct?\nA. Yes, and that\u2019s why I dropped the charges.\nQ. Now, if you could just stick to my question. Okay?\nA. Yes. Okay.\nQ. Did you appear in Youngstown Municipal Court in \nconnection with that case?\nA. The courthouse over there?\nQ. Yes.\nA. Just -- just to --\nQ. Again, my question is just, did you appear there?\nA. I appeared there, yes.\n\nAppendix A\n68a\nQ. And did you tell the officials there that you wanted \nto drop those charges?\nA. Yes.\nMR. GROSTIC: Nothing further, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Cross-examination of Ms. Infante?\n[58]MR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCROSS-EXAMINATION OF MELISSA INFANTE\nBY MR. JOYCE:\nQ.

All right. You said that leading up to the events that \nyou testified to about your house and your argument with \nMr. Esteras, you said you had been arguing.\nDo you recall making that statement?\nA.

That was near the kitchen.\nQ. Okay. You struck him first, and his reaction was \nthen to push you in your neck?\n[61]A.

They were in their rooms.\nQ. So when Mr. Esteras came into your home and \nbegan arguing with you, you were alone; is that right?\n\nAppendix A\n73a\nA. I was with the girl that had the box braids in the \nvideo. We were sitting in the kitchen.\nQ. All right. And who is that?\nA. She is -- she is my daughter\u2019s friend.\nQ. She is your daughter\u2019s friend?\nA. Uh-huh.\nQ. Okay. And why was she over?\nA. She -- well, currently she\u2019s homeless, so I was \nletting her stay there.\nQ. All right.

And if you care to suggest what consequence, \nif any, be imposed should I find he has violated.\nDo you mind going first, Government\u2019s Counsel?\nMR. JOYCE: Not at all. Thank you, Your Honor. Your \nHonor, would the Court prefer I speak from the lectern \nor from my seat?\nTHE COURT: Wherever you are most comfortable. \nI think Madam Court Reporter and I can hear you from \nthere as well as from the podium. So you are welcome to \nstay at your seat or walk to the podium, whichever you\u2019d \nlike.\n\nAppendix A\n86a\nMR. JOYCE: Thank you, Your Honor. I will elect to \nspeak from the podium.\nYour Honor, I submit to the Court that the evidence \npresented here today does establish by a preponderance \nof the evidence that Mr. Esteras has, in fact, [72]violated \na number of his conditions, two of which, of course, are \noutlined in the report dated January 30th of 2023, Your \nHonor.\nThe first violation, titled as a new law violation, \nincludes a number of different misdemeanor charges that \nhad been filed in the Youngstown Municipal Court, those \nbeing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, criminal \ndamaging/endangering.\nAnd, Your Honor, the evidence presented here clearly \ndemonstrates that Mr. Esteras did, in fact, violate his \nconditions in those ways.\nWe watched body cam footage that was captured \nby the officer who responded shortly after the events in \nquestion took place. And from that footage, which was \nvery clear in nature, we were benefited with a statement \nby Ms. Infante that she offered to him while she was still \nreally under the stress of what had happened.\nWhile the officer testified that in his recollection he \ndidn\u2019t recall her to be crying when I asked that on direct \nexamination, I would submit that rewatching that video, \nyou can see that when she first interacts with the officer, \nshe, I believe, is crying.\n\nAppendix A\n87a\nAnd the significance of that is just that she was still \nunder the stress of what happened. Her memory at that \nmoment in time, I submit, wouldn\u2019t -- will never be better. \n[73]Right? She had just experienced it. She was still \nshaken up by it.\nAnd it was clear, and she repeated it a number of times \nthroughout that video, and then submitted it -- committed \nit, pardon me, to writing as well.\nAnd the order of what she described was consistent \neach time. That Mr. Esteras arrived. He entered her home \nunannounced. He struck her, as she said -- she was at the \ntable when he entered. At some point he struck her. She did \nexplain on the video that she hit him or scratched him back \nor something to that effect. But he initiated that contact.\nAnd then at some point, out of his anger, he punched \nthe TV. He broke it. And then she followed him outside. \nAnd she approached him at his vehicle. When she saw it \nwas her vehicle, she was upset. It was supposed to be at \nhis shop, and here he was driving it, so she took the keys \nfrom him.\nAnd his reaction to that was to pull out a firearm. She \ndidn\u2019t hesitate in her description to the officer that it was \na firearm. She described where he was standing. She said \nhow he aimed it. She gestured even in the video, if you \nwatch, with her hands of how he stood and where he aimed, \nfresh in her mind at the time she gave that statement as \nto what happened.\n\nAppendix A\n88a\n[74]And then he fired a number of times. That \nstatement, again, she made it then, it certainly appeared \ntruthful and genuine as I watched it. But it\u2019s supported \nand buttressed by the fact that the officers who arrived, \npointed to the area where he stood and fired this gun \nallegedly, they found a shell casing. That is a piece of \nevidence that supports her story that she explained to \nthe officers that night.\nThey found bullet holes in the vehicle in the exact \nway that she described, where he was standing, how he \naimed, how he fired it. They went and looked at the car \nand, sure enough, bullet holes in the windshield and the \nhood of the vehicle.\nThey then went in the home. Of course, they saw, you \ncan see in the body cam footage, the TV is broken. You can \nhear her as she discusses what happens with a number of \nthe people in the room, people who were, based on their \nown statements, not her statement that she told the police, \nbased on their own statements captured by the body cam, \npresent when this happened.\nThey described the manner with which Mr. Esteras \nentered the home, how he angrily was stomping and \nwalked up and how this happens all the time. They \nexplained -- you can hear some of the children who were \nin the home at the time this gun was fired. You can hear \nthem talking about [75]how they were shocked that he \nhad pointed the gun at him. They had seen this firearm.\nAll of that, Your Honor, supports the statement that \nwas given by Ms. Infante on the day in question that is \n\nAppendix A\n89a\ncaptured by the body cam, that, again, she committed to \nwriting, and then she filed in court the following day in \nan effort to have charges filed.\nI submit to you that all the evidence that was \npresented, the photographs, the testimony and the body \ncam footage, all taken together, looking at those, and any \nreasonable inferences that can be drawn from all those \nevidence viewed in its totality, support the fact that Mr. \nEsteras did exactly what she described that evening. That \nhe did violate his conditions of supervision in the ways that \nare described in the violation report of January 30th, 2023.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Joyce.\nMr. Grostic, I would like to hear your allocution/\nargument before I hear Mr. Esteras\u2019s allocution. You have \nthe same opportunity, from where you are or the podium, \nyour choice.\nMR. GROSTIC: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMy colleague obviously emphasized the body cam \nvideo that we saw. Ms. Infante obviously also was in this \n[76]courtroom after being instructed that she was under \npenalty of perjury with all the consequences that could \nfollow. And after that instruction, Ms. Infante corrected \nsome of the things that she said that night.\nMy colleague emphasized that that was while she was \nunder the stress of what happened. As she said here today, \n\nAppendix A\n90a\nshe was angry. The order was not consistent, though, in \nthat body cam. The first statement she made to police is \nthat he came and he shot at her vehicle and then came \ninside. Later it changed to he shot at the vehicle after she \nwent outside. It was not consistent between the statements \nthat were made.\nThere was no point at which she said that -- or that \na gun was inside the home. I don\u2019t know about this point \nabout pointing the gun at children. She didn\u2019t say that on \nthe body cam and she did not say that here.\nTHE COURT: But the video, you didn\u2019t hear anything \nabout that during the video? One of the younger women \nsaid, \u201cWhy he point that gun at us?\u201d\nMR. GROSTIC: I did -- I did hear that said. And it\u2019s -- \nI don\u2019t know what to make of that, because it\u2019s inconsistent \nwith the story we\u2019ve heard.\nTHE COURT: Not really. Not really. If you imagine \n-- and you saw the video. You saw the car in the driveway \nfacing the street. You saw the photos that were [77]\nseparate from the video. You saw that there was a photo \nof what\u2019s believed to be -- well, a bullet shot through the \nwindshield that\u2019s facing the house, through the front grill \nthat\u2019s facing the house, and then also the hood.\nSo anyone who is able to connect a bullet with that \nvehicle in that way is shooting towards the house. I \nunderstand precisely why anyone inside of the house, Mr. \nGrostic, might say, \u201cWhy he point that gun at us,\u201d because \nthat gun was pointed at every individual inside of that \n\nAppendix A\n91a\nhouse. The only way that could happen, when the bullets \nwere made -- bullet holes were made while the gun was \n-- while the car was in the driveway, and I haven\u2019t heard \nthat even from the on-the-stand testimony, that the bullet \nshots were otherwise put there.\nMake sense?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, I understand now, Your Honor. \nAnd I guess the only point that I would make is that it\u2019s \nnot clear, at least to me, that the people inside were saying \nthat based on what they themselves saw, or whether that \nthey were hearing something else. I mean, Ms. Infante \ntestified today that the bullet holes were there before that \nhe came over.\nTHE COURT: Well, I won\u2019t disagree with you on that. \nThank you for engaging me. You are free to go on.\nMR. GROSTIC: As far as my argument, I would leave \n[78]the Court simply with that, that present here in court, \nunder penalty of perjury and subject to cross-examination, \nMs. Infante said that he did not commit these violations.\nI would turn then -- I am, of course, in a difficult \nposition where I am first trying to persuade the Court \nnot to impose any penalty. But should the Court decide \nthat Mr. Esteras has violated the terms of his supervised \nrelease, I do want to emphasize just certain information \nthat is contained in the violation report. And I know the \nCourt\u2019s reviewed that, simply because the Court pointed \none of the things out at the beginning.\n\nAppendix A\n92a\nBut that he has been employed full time. He did have \nboth substance abuse and mental health assessments \ncomplete. He had, as the Court noted already, completed \nhis GED, even after the Court suspended that requirement. \nHe had over three years of supervised release where he \nwas, you know, according to these conditions, doing the \nthings that the Court wanted him to. And then we\u2019re here \nnow on something that happened in January.\nSo I do just want to bring those things up for the \nCourt\u2019s attention, should the Court decide that there is a \npenalty to be imposed here.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Grostic.\nWill you have Mr. Esteras join you?\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \n[79]and Mr. Grostic.)\nTHE COURT: Mr. Esteras, you have the opportunity \nto be heard. And I am going to slightly modify the outline \nof events that I\u2019ve said. I am going to sum up my findings \nso that you can speak in response, which I think is the \nway allocution is meant. You know, the attorneys are \ncomfortable, as you saw your attorney do one thing, argue, \nand then allocute. You will only allocute. And I think it \nfairest to you to know what my thoughts are.\nAs you know, you\u2019ve been -- it has been alleged that \nyou have violated your term of supervised release in two \nways. New law violation, that is, a violation of law here in \nYoungstown, Ohio, resulting in you being charged with \n\nAppendix A\n93a\nthree misdemeanor offenses. And then separately, the \npossession of a firearm.\nIt is important that I discern one from the other, \nbecause it\u2019s with similar behavior, or overlapping behavior, \nthe same behavior that you\u2019ve committed both, or it\u2019s \nalleged that you committed both.\nI am obligated, as I explained earlier, pursuant \nto 3583(g), to revoke the supervision of someone who \npossesses a firearm. And I make that finding, if I can, by \na preponderance of the evidence. It is a lesser standard \nthan beyond a reasonable doubt. It is a higher standard \nthan probable cause. And I make that finding today, \nthat [80]you possessed a firearm while under a term of \nsupervised release.\nI make that finding based on the evidence that\u2019s been \npresented here, taking into consideration the things that \nI should.\nFirst of all, that you were under a term of supervision \nthat explicitly prohibited you from possessing a weapon, or \nhaving access to a firearm. I believe you did possess and \nhave access, brandished and shot a firearm, three times, \nas Ms. Infante said in the video that we spent at least 23 \nminutes viewing here together.\nAnd it\u2019s not just that I accept the video cam footage. \nI appreciate when it exists. I am happy it existed for this \ncase. But it was corroborated, not only by the words of \nMs. Infante, but the words of the several others who spoke \nabout the assault you made on that household that evening.\n\nAppendix A\n94a\nAnd then, as Mr. Joyce has explained, she didn\u2019t \njust complain to the police that evening, she also \ncorroborated that complaint by leaving her home, going \nto the Youngstown Municipal Court the next day, and \ncomplaining about your behavior. It\u2019s only been here in \nthis courtroom this evening, as Mr. Grostic said, after \nbeen warned of penalties that could attach if she lied, and \nshe did anyway, but victims of domestic offense often do \nthat, that she\u2019d [81]change her story. But only enough to \nmake her appear confused. Nothing she said that was of \nsignificance while under oath persuades me to believe that \nyou did not possess the weapon, that you did not point it \nat that household, that you did not discharge it at least \nthree times.\nNow, regarding the new law violation, I wish I were \nbetter versed in the ordinances, regulations, the actual law \nof Youngstown, knowing its elements. I suspect that your \nbehavior at targeting the house with a weapon and actually \nassaulting the car with at least three bullets, the casing of \none which was found in the driveway, match the elements. \nBut I just don\u2019t know. And it really doesn\u2019t matter. Because \nas I told counsel at the beginning of the hearing, both are \nGrade C violations. You are subject to the same penalties \nregardless of whether I find that you violated your term \nof supervised release in one or two ways.\nSo I find that the new law violation and Ms. Infante\u2019s \ncorroboration of it by presenting herself at Youngstown \nMunicipal Court the next day is evidence that I can \nconsider in the punishment I will issue today. But I find \nexplicitly that you violated your term of supervision by \npossessing a weapon.\n\nAppendix A\n95a\nI will allow you to allocute now, and then I will respond \nby imposing consequences. You have the opportunity to \nspeak if you would like to be heard.\n[82](Discussion held off the record between the \ndefendant and Mr. Grostic.)\nTHE DEFENDANT: I really ain\u2019t got -- I ain\u2019t got \nthat much to say. If -- it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t.\nTHE COURT: You choose not to allocute?\nTHE DEFENDANT: What can I say if you -- I just \ndon\u2019t.\nMR. GROSTIC: Okay. If I could have one moment, \nYour Honor.\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, after discussion, which \nI appreciate the Court\u2019s indulging me, Mr. Esteras has \nconfirmed with me that he does not want to say anything \nfurther.\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\nThat\u2019s fine, Mr. Esteras. You\u2019ve been before a federal \njudge at least three times facing a sentencing. The first \n\nAppendix A\n96a\ntime was my colleague, Judge Polster. The last time was \nme. This time is also me meting out a sentence.\nSo I understand that you understand the right you \nhave and the right you give up. You have been under a \nterm of supervised release at least twice. When I imposed \nsentence upon you the last time, I sentenced you for \nthe [83]commission of the crime that was on my docket, \nconspiracy to distribute heroin, and I also sentenced you \nfor the violation of the earlier term of supervision imposed \nthat you were under when you were indicted in the new \ncase then on my docket, and that was possession with \nintent -- conspiracy to possess with intent cocaine and \ncocaine base.\nSo you are no stranger to law violations and no \nstranger to federal court. My worry for you, sir, is that \nwhat\u2019s been done before isn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter \nyou, to encourage you to be respectful of the law, to be \nlaw-abiding.\nEven things I heard in the video that were repeated \ntoday, it appears that you assault that household regularly. \nThat you argue in a violent way with Ms. Infante regularly. \nI am not really sure what it will require for you to learn \nthat enough is enough. You were given probation by Judge \nPolster. I imposed two rather lenient sentences, 15 months \non that term of supervision violation for Judge Polster; \nfor my own case, 12 months. I ran them consecutively. I \nthought 27 months might encourage you to do better.\nIt was with some reluctance, a great deal actually, that \nI even suspended the GED qualification, thinking that \n\nAppendix A\n97a\nperhaps if you were to become better educated, prove to \nyourself and others that you can read and write at [84]at \nleast a high school level, you might begin to see yourself \nas something other than a law violator, someone who hits \nwomen, someone who disturbs children in the middle of \nthe night.\nMy reading of the police report is that Officer DiMaiolo \nwas at that household at about 3:28 a.m. on a school night. \nLate January. Vacation is over. There were school-aged \npersons in that video, and yet they were awake -- not all \nof them were school-aged, of course -- because you had \nassaulted the car and the household with your intentions \nand broken the TV.\nOne of the youngsters said, \u201cI was scared. Now I \ncan\u2019t watch TV.\u201d That might seem insignificant to you, but \nchildren shouldn\u2019t grow up afraid of what their father or \ntheir mother\u2019s boyfriend might do to them at night.\nWhen I consider the guidance given to us by Officer \nZakrajsek that I\u2019ve confirmed with you, is not objected to, \nand in my opinion is correct, you are subject, pursuant to \nthe advisory guidelines, to 6 to 12 months. We know that \nyour offense that\u2019s brought you here on my docket carries \na lifetime of supervision.\nHaving found that you are in violation of that term of \nsupervised release by the preponderance of the evidence, \nI must escalate the consequences imposed. And I do here \nimpose escalated consequences by exercising my [85]\ndiscretion to vary upwards, above even the high end of \nthe advisory guidelines, because your behavior is not \n\nAppendix A\n98a\naverage, it\u2019s not typical, it\u2019s not mine run, it\u2019s exceptional. \nIt\u2019s disrespectful. It\u2019s dangerous. And it must stop.\nAnd if you cannot stop yourself, I will separate you \nfrom society for long enough to at least allow you to \nreconsider your behavior. And hopefully when you return \nunder the new term of supervision that I will impose, you \nwill do better. You will think before you act. And you will \nunderstand that never possessing a weapon or dangerous \ndevice or a single bullet is meant for you for the rest of \nyour natural life.\nPlease listen as I formally impose consequences.\nI revoke your term of supervised release. I hereby \nimpose a term of incarceration of 24 months. A new \nterm of supervised release of three years. Every term of \nsupervised release that I imposed earlier, the last time I \nsentenced you in September of 2018, is reimposed unless \nit\u2019s been met. For instance, I don\u2019t require you to obtain a \nGED again. If you\u2019ve paid your special assessment, that\u2019s \nsatisfied.\nBut every other term, including substance abuse \ntreatment and testing, a search and seizure provision, \nmental health treatment are the ones I am listing simply \nbecause I believe they have likely not been met. And if \n-- [86]I mean, likely are those that are capable of being \nrepeated and shall be repeated.\nAnd I am adding a new one. I am adding, for the \nfirst six months of your release -- keep in mind, I can \n\nAppendix A\n99a\nincarcerate you for up to three years. I have stopped at 24 \nmonths. But once you\u2019re released to start this new three-\nyear term of supervised release, for the first six months, \nyou are going to be on location monitoring with a curfew.\nMr. Zakrajsek, Mr. Esteras goes nowhere without the \nexplicit permission of his supervising probation officer. \nHe shall only live at a place approved by the probation \noffice. Make sure there are no weapons there. If he\u2019s \nunable to find such a place, then he\u2019ll start his term of \nrelease by living in a residential reentry center until he \nhas enough money to pay his own rent and live in a place \nthat is suitable.\nI order that this curfew allow him to work, to attend \nto medical appointments as necessary, and to only be in \nthe presence of the victim and the minor children who live \nwith him with the permission of the supervising probation \nofficer.\nIs all of that clear, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Sir, I have revoked your term of [87]\nsupervised release. You have a new term -- a new ability \nto appeal the sentence that I have imposed. There is still \nthe limit. You\u2019ve heard this before. It remains 14 days from \nthe date on which I reduce to writing the sentence I\u2019ve \nimposed. If you allow that 14-day period to go by without \nfiling a notice of appeal, you may have forever waived your \nappellate rights.\n\nAppendix A\n100a\nMr. Grostic, will you speak with your client about his \nappellate rights?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Should he ask you to do so, will you \ntimely file a notice of appeal for him?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: You should know, Mr. Esteras, as you \nlikely do, if you cannot afford counsel, just like you do not \npay Mr. Grostic or his office, counsel will be appointed to \nrepresent you free of charge. So that should not be the \nreason you don\u2019t timely file a notice of appeal.\nDo you understand that?\nTHE DEFENDANT: (Nodding head up and down.)\nYes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Zakrajsek, you have heard me \nreimpose conditions that are obviously not completed \nand are capable of being repeated, and I believe will \nbe of assistance to Mr. Esteras when he returns to the \ncommunity. [88]And I have added six months of location \nmonitoring with a curfew.\nIs there anything else you\u2019d like me to consider at \nthis time?\n\nAppendix A\n101a\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: Your Honor, I would \nlike to petition the Court to consider possibly an anger \nmanagement program as well due to his anger issues.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. I think that\u2019s an excellent \nsuggestion.\nSo in the past, Mr. Esteras, I have ordered that you \nbe subjected to mental health treatment. I am ordering \nthat again. It will start with an evaluation. Part of the \ntreatment you\u2019ll undergo after that evaluation will be \nanger management.\nIf you do behave in the way that the violation that\u2019s \nbrought you to court seems to indicate is a regular \noccurrence, you must learn to control yourself or you are \nlikely going to do something that is going to separate you \nfrom society for a much longer period than just 24 months.\nSo I do impose, as a component of mental health, anger \nmanagement.\nWhat else, Mr. Zakrajsek?\nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK: Nothing further, Your \nHonor.\nThank you.\nTHE COURT: Thank you for your work in this case.\n[89]Mr. Joyce, what do you believe I can do to improve \nthe terms of Mr. Esteras\u2019s three years of supervised \nrelease?\n\nAppendix A\n102a\nMR. JOYCE: Your Honor, I believe the conditions \nthat you have outlined here, with the addition from -- the \nadditional recommend by Mr. Zakrajsek are appropriate, \nand I would offer nothing additional. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Your objection to the sentence imposed, \nGovernment\u2019s Counsel.\nMR. JOYCE: I have no objection, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, why don\u2019t I start by asking \nyou what you think I can do to improve the conditions \nof supervised release. Of course, all of the mandatory, \nstandard, and the conditions I\u2019ve just outlined are those \nthat fall under special conditions.\nMR. GROSTIC: (Nodding head up and down.)\nTHE COURT: Thank you for nodding that you \nunderstood that. If there are any others that you \nbelieve I should impose that will assist your client or \nimpose in a different way, like Mr. Zakrajsek suggested \nregarding refining mental health, it\u2019s not limited to anger \nmanagement, but that\u2019s now a specific component, is there \nanything else you\u2019d suggest?\nMR. GROSTIC: I don\u2019t believe so, Your Honor, as far \nas conditions of supervised release.\n[90]We would ask, as part of the custodial sentence, \nfor a recommendation close to home.\n\nAppendix A\n103a\nTHE COURT: And close to home, meaning here in \nthe Northern District of Ohio?\nMR. GROSTIC: Yes.\nTHE COURT: I will make that recommendation.\nWhere were you housed during your last term of \nincarceration, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Hazelton.\nTHE COURT: Hazelton. I don\u2019t know what the policy \nof the Bureau of Prisons is regarding sending you back \nto a place where you\u2019ve been. If there is no prohibition, if \nthey were to send you back to Hazelton, is that something \nyou\u2019d like me to ask for, or would you rather something \neven closer to home, such as Elkton?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah, closer to home.\nTHE COURT: More like Elkton than Hazelton?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: All right. I will make that \nrecommendation.\nWhat else? What other recommendations, if there are \nany, Mr. Grostic?\n\nAppendix A\n104a\nMR. GROSTIC: May I have one moment, Your Honor?\nTHE COURT: Certainly.\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \n[91]and Mr. Grostic.)\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would also \nrequest that the Court recommend that he be evaluated \nfor placement in any applicable drug treatment program, \nas well as any applicable behavioral management or mental \nhealth treatment program for which he might qualify.\nTHE COURT: Thank you. I will make both of those \nrecommendations as well.\nMy belief, Mr. Esteras, is that a 24-month term, while \nlonger than one you would like, I\u2019m sure, is not long enough \nfor the most intensive drug treatment program, but I am \nsure there are others that may be helpful to you. And I \nhope that along with my recommendation, you will sign up \nand apply yourself to any programs that you\u2019re admitted. \nAnd I will recommend those for behavioral management \nand drug treatment.\nWhat else, if anything else? I am open to adopting \nwhatever you recommend if it will help Mr. Esteras.\nMR. GROSTIC: No, nothing further, Your Honor. \nThank you.\n\nAppendix A\n105a\nTHE COURT: Your objection to the sentence imposed \non behalf of your client, Mr. Grostic.\nMR. GROSTIC: Your Honor, I believe the Court \nindicated that it considered factors -- the factor in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) as part of its sentence. I have [92]objected to \nthat in the past. I am aware that actually the Sixth Circuit \nhas held that that is something the Court can consider, but \nI would simply like to lodge that objection for the record.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Grostic, when you specify Section \n3553(a)(2)(A), are you referring to underneath -- (2) is the \nneed for the sentence to be imposed, correct? You are \nspecifically objecting to, \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment for the offense,\u201d that\u2019s what you\u2019re directing \nyour objection to?\nMR. GROSTIC: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: To any one of those three subfactors \nor all of them?\nMR. GROSTIC: All of them, yes.\nTHE COURT: Well, I would agree with you, part of \nmy contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law. I mentioned \ndeterring Mr. Esteras as well. I also meant, and I think \nit\u2019s fair for you to infer, concern about the safety of the \ncommunity, which is later beyond (a)(2). And I specifically \nreferenced the ability even to depart or, pardon me, vary \n\nAppendix A\n106a\nupwards to separate Mr. Esteras from the average, \ntypical, mine run-type defendant.\nSo I think I have sufficiently addressed what your [93]\nobjection is, and you are entitled to it.\nI will add just one other point. If it enlarges your \nobjection, you will be able to tell me.\nWhen I told counsel earlier that this is a 104(a) hearing, \nunder the rules of evidence, that they\u2019re suspended, I still, \nbeing a student of the rules of evidence, it is hard to put \nthem out of your mind. And even though I am not obligated \nto explicitly make calls on matters, objections, sustain, \noverrule them, I still try to hew closely to considering \nevidence in a way that makes sense when the rules of \nevidence are considered.\nAnd I want the record to reflect that when I did that, \nand I suspect Mr. Grostic might have been doing this as \nwell, I kept in mind Rule of Evidence 803. Rule of Evidence \n803 is one of those rules that outlines exceptions to the \nrules against hearsay, and it explicitly says, \u201cRegardless \nof whether a declarant is available as a witness, Judge, \nyou can consider certain things.\u201d\nAnd these are things that are well established to \nbe truthful, or more likely than not, I should say, to \nbe truthful, credible. And they include present sense \nimpressions, statements made while explaining an event \nor condition, those statements made immediately after \nthe declarant perceived it.\n\nAppendix A\n107a\nSo like those statements, Mr. Esteras, that [94]Ms. \nInfante made as soon as Officer DiMaiolo showed up, I \nconsidered, because I believe, as Mr. Joyce said, she was \nher most credible at those moments.\n\u201cExcited utterance, a statement relating to a startling \nevent or condition made while the declarant was under the \nstress of the excitement that it caused.\u201d\nThose folks in that house, the youngster, the woman \nwith the box braids, the two young women who were \nstanding on either side of Ms. Infante, one of whom was \nthe one who said, \u201cI was scared. I can\u2019t watch TV.\u201d The \nother said, \u201cWhy he point a gun at us?\u201d I considered those \nexcited utterances and found them to be credible.\n\u201cThen existing mental, emotional, or physical \ncondition\u201d is another one of those categories that has sort \nof a threshold, a built-in credibility. I don\u2019t have to accept \nthem, but I use that as a way to cabin what I was hearing \non the witness stand compared to what I had heard in \nthat video.\nSo I used those things, Mr. Grostic. And I think that \nwas part of the argument made by Mr. Joyce to corroborate \nwhat I heard on the video and to discredit what I heard \nfrom Ms. Infante during most of her testimony. There \nwere nuggets of truth, very few of them. Most of the time \nshe made up answers purposefully to distinguish today\u2019s \ntestimony from what we saw in the video.\n[95]If you\u2019d like to enlarge your objection, you have \nevery right to and I\u2019ll allow it, please.\n\nAppendix A\n108a\nMR. GROSTIC: No, nothing further, Your Honor. \nThank you.\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\nThank you for the work you\u2019ve done, Counselors, in \nmaking a full record.\nMr. Esteras, I meant it when I said earlier that I \nam proud of you for earning your GED. That told me, \neven after you knew you were not obligated to do it, you \npersisted and you did it.\nMy hope is you\u2019ll give some thoughts to your condition, \nyour own circumstances, your role in these conditions \nand circumstances, and you will continue despite what \nyou think anyone thinks about you, go forward, improve \nyourself and have a better life. I still believe you can do \nthat.\nI could have given you the three years. I have not. I \nhave given you what I have given you. You have earned \nwhat I have given you. But my hope is you\u2019ll go forward. \nThe three years of supervised release won\u2019t only be \npunitive. Meaning the location monitoring with the curfew \nis meant to restrict your freedom, make sure you\u2019re not \ndoing things that you and I will regret. But the terms, \nthe anger management, the other terms that are there \nare [96]there to bolster you, help you to do better going \nforward. You are still a young man. I hope you will choose \na different lifestyle.\n\nAppendix A\n109a\nThe hearing is adjourned.\nTHE CLERK: All rise.\n(Proceedings concluded at 5:28 p.m.)\n\nAppendix B\n110a\nAPPENDIX B \u2014 ORDER OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN \nDISTRICT OF OHIO, EASTERN DIVISION, \nFILED MAY 9, 2023\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nEASTERN DIVISION\nCase No. 4:14-CR-425-10\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nEDGARDO ESTERAS,\nDefendant.\nFiled May 9, 2023\nORDER\nOn September 6, 2018, Defendant Edgardo Esteras \nwas sentenced to a 12-month term of incarceration as to \nCount 1 of the Indictment for conspiracy to distribute \nheroin, such term to be served consecutively to the \n15-month term of incarceration imposed for the probation \nviolation in Case No. 4:11-CR-276-12-DAP, followed by a \nsix-year term of supervised release, with standard and \nspecial conditions of supervision imposed. Defendant was \nfurther ordered to pay a $100.00 special assessment.\n\nAppendix B\n111a\nFollowing Defendant\u2019s term of incarceration, \nsupervised release commenced on January 10, 2020.\nOn or about February 20, 2020, the United States \nProbation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) submitted a Supervision \nReport to request a suspension of the GED condition:\nThis report serves to request a suspension \nof the General Education Diploma (GED) \ncondition. Before incarceration, Mr. Esteras \nwas diagnosed with an intellectual development \ndisorder indicating difficulty with reading, \nwriting, and comprehension. The undersigned \nofficer has had multiple conversations with \nMr. Esteras regarding the condition. Mr. \nEsteras has expressed a willingness to work \ntoward obtaining his GED, but disclosed that \nhe has tried and does not think he is capable of \ncomprehending the material.\nOn July 20, 2020, the Court ordered suspension of the \nGED requirement under the circumstances described.\nOn or about September 19, 2022, the USPO issued a \nSupervision Report to relay a request from Defendant for \nearly termination of his term of supervised release.\nOn September 21, 2022, the Court denied Defendant\u2019s \nrequest for early termination of supervised release, \nwithout prejudice to another request being considered at \na later time.\n\nAppendix B\n112a\nOn or about January 23, 2023, the USPO issued \na Violation Report to notify the Court of Defendant\u2019s \nviolation of the terms and conditions of his supervised \nrelease:\n-New Criminal Charges (filing is pending with \nYoungstown Municipal Court)\n-Violent Conduct\n-Whereabouts Unknown (Absconder)\nOn January 23, 2023, at 0003 hours, Officers \nwith the Youngstown Police Department \nwere dispatched to 1137 Inverness Avenue \nin Youngstown in reference to gunfire. Upon \narrival, contact was made with the victim, who \nadvised the father of her children, Edgardo \nEsteras, had physically assaulted her and \nthreatened to kill her. At approximately 2350 \nhours, Mr. Esteras stormed into the residence, \nstruck the victim in the head, punched a \ntelevision set, and then stormed outside of the \nresidence. The victim followed Mr. Edgardo out \nof the residence who was now inside a vehicle. \nThe victim reached inside the vehicle to grab \nMr. Esteras car keys, at which time he produced \na handgun and pointed it at the victim and \nstated, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d. At this time, the \nvictim retreated inside the residence at which \ntime Mr. Esteras fired three rounds into her \nvehicle, an Infiniti JX35, which was located in \n\nAppendix B\n113a\nthe driveway of the residence. Mr. Esteras then \nfled the scene in a Black Chevy Blazer with an \nunknown registration.\nOfficers recovered spent 9mm shell casings and \nobserved three bullet holes in the side of MI\u2019s \nvehicle, as well as a broken television set. The \nvictim refused medical treatment but did advise \nshe wished to file charges of domestic violence \nagainst Mr. Esteras. The victim further \nadvised that Mr. Esteras frequently assaults \nher, and she has had enough. The Youngstown \nPolice Department is currently pursuing \ncharges of Domestic Violence, Illegal Discharge \nof a Firearm, and Vehicular Vandalism. Formal \ncharges have not been officially filed and Mr. \nEsteras remains at large as of the time of this \nreport.\nOn January 23, 2023, the Court ordered the \nissuance of a Warrant for Defendant\u2019s arrest. \nOn or about January 30, 2023, the USPO issued a \nFollow Up Violation Report to provide an update to the \nCourt on Defendant\u2019s violations:\n1.\t New Law Violation: On January 23, 2023, \nMr. Esteras was charged with Domestic \nViolence (M1), Aggravated Menacing (M1), \nand Criminal Damaging/Endangering (M2) \nin the Youngstown Municipal Court under \ncase number 2023CRB00121.\n\nAppendix B\n114a\n2.\t Possession of a Firearm: On January 23, \n2023, Mr. Esteras did have in his possession \nor under his control a firearm.\nDefendant was arrested and appeared before \nMagistrate Judge Amanda M. Knapp on January 31, \n2023 for an initial appearance. On February 6, 2023, \nMagistrate Judge Knapp conducted preliminary and \ndetention hearings. The Court found that probable cause \nexisted for the violations, and additional proceedings \nwould be conducted by the undersigned. Defendant was \nremanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\nOn or about March 14, 2023, the USPO issued a \nSupplemental Information Report to provide an update \nto the Court regarding the status of Defendant\u2019s state \ncharges:\nOn January 22, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged \nwith Domestic Violence (M1), Aggravated \nMenacing (M1), and Criminal Damaging (M2) \nin the Youngstown Municipal Court under case \nnumber 2023CRB00121Y. On February 22, \n2023, all charges were dismissed at request of \nthe victim.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court conducted a Supervised \nRelease Violation Hearing and Sentencing, at which time \nDefendant denied Violation Numbers 1 and 2. Officer \nRobert DiMaiolo testified on direct examination by the \nGovernment, with cross examination by the defense. The \nGovernment played a bodycam video (Exhibit 5) of the \n\nAppendix B\n115a\nvictim and her family\u2019s early morning interactions with \nlaw enforcement officers shortly after the above referenced \ncrimes occurred.1 During those recorded interactions, no \none indicated a perpetrator other than Defendant. The \nalleged victim testified that, after that early morning \ninteraction with law enforcement, she went to municipal \ncourt and reported Defendant as the perpetrator of the \ncrimes. Despite the strong evidence against Defendant, \nthe victim attempted (unpersuasively) to recant, when \nexamined on direct examination by defense counsel. The \nGovernment effectively cross examined the victim and \nsubmitted Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted without objection. The Court found by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Defendant possessed \na firearm, in violation of the terms of his supervised \nrelease, sustaining Violation No. 2. The Court proceeded \nto pronounce sentence after allocution.\nSENTENCING\nAmong other things, the Court has considered the \nevidence presented at the violation hearing, statutory \nmaximum penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(3); \nthe advisory policy statements set forth in Chapter Seven \nof the United States Sentencing Guidelines; and the \nsuggested range of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G. \n\u00a7\u00a07B1.4(a). Furthermore, the Court has considered the \nfactors and conditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a) and 3583(d), respectively.\n1.\u2002 The video revealed a household of individuals of myriad \nages joining the victim in recounting Defendant\u2019s visit to the home \nduring which he discharged a firearm into the victim\u2019s car, forcibly \nbroke the household\u2019s television and punched the victim in the neck.\n\nAppendix B\n116a\nBased upon the Court\u2019s review and for the reasons set \nforth on the record, Defendant\u2019s term of supervised release \nis revoked. The Court varied upwards and imposed a term \nof incarceration of 24 months, for among other reasons, to \nprotect society and promote respect for the law. The Court \nrecommends that Defendant be designated to a facility \nclose to his home, such as FCI Elkton, Lisbon, OH, and \nbe permitted to participate in any drug treatment and \nanger management/behavioral programs. Upon release, \nDefendant shall serve a three-year term of supervised \nrelease, with all uncompleted conditions of supervised \nrelease remaining imposed. The first six months of his \nsupervised release shall be on location monitoring with a \ncurfew. Defendant is prohibited from contacting the victim \nor her children without permission from his supervising \nofficer. The special condition of mental health treatment \nis reimposed to include an anger management component.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nMay 9, 2023\t \t\n\t\n/s/ Benita Y.

The parties have waived oral \nargument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral \n\nAppendix C\n118a\nargument is not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a). As \nset forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s revocation \norder.\nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to \ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0841(a)(1) and 846. Varying \ndownward from a guidelines range of 15 to 21 months, \nthe district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively to a 15-month \nprison term for violating his probation for a prior federal \ndrug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of \nsupervised release.\nEstera\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began \nin January 2020. Three years later, in January 2023, the \nprobation office reported to the district court that Esteras \nhad violated the conditions of his supervised release by \n(1) committing new law violations (domestic violence, \naggravated menacing, and criminal damaging) and (2) \npossessing a firearm. The probation office subsequently \nnotified the district court that the new criminal charges \nagainst Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.\nFollowing a hearing on the supervised-release \nviolations, the district court found by a preponderance \nof the evidence that Esteras had possessed a firearm \nbut declined to find that he had committed a new law \nviolation. The district court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised \nrelease and sentenced him to 24 months of imprisonment, \nvarying upward from a policy-statement range of six to \n\nAppendix C\n119a\n12 months, followed by three years of supervised release. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of the \nfactors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2014\u201cthe need \nfor the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the seriousness \nof the offense.\u201d The district court confirmed that it had \nconsidered the need to promote respect for the law along \nwith other \u00a7\u00a03553(a) factors, including the need to afford \nadequate deterrence and protect the public.\nIn this timely appeal, Esteras argues that his \nsentence is unreasonable because the district court relied \non the factors listed in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A). The statutory \nprovision addressing revocation of supervised release, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e), provides that, if a defendant violates \na condition of supervised release, the district court may, \nafter considering certain enumerated factors set forth \nin \u00a7\u00a03553(a), revoke the defendant\u2019s supervised release \nand impose an additional prison term. But \u00a7\u00a03583(e) does \nnot include the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors among the list of \nenumerated factors. Nonetheless, as Esteras concedes, \nwe have held \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error \nto consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for \nviolation of supervised release, even though this factor is \nnot enumerated in \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\u201d United States v. Lewis, 498 \nF.3d 393, 399-400 (6th Cir. 2007). Esteras contends that \nLewis was wrongly decided. But we \u201cmay not overrule \nthe decision of another panel; only the en banc court or \nthe United States Supreme Court may overrule the prior \npanel.\u201d United States v. Ferguson, 868 F.3d 514, 515 (6th \nCir. 2017).\n\nAppendix C\n120a\nBecause Esteras\u2019s only argument is foreclosed by our \nprecedent, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation \norder.\nENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT\n/s/ Deborah S.

WHITE, J., joins in the \nresult because she agrees that United States v. Lewis, \n498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007) is controlling.\n*This decision originally issued as a judge order on August \n16, 2023. The court has now designated the amended order for \npublication.\n\nAppendix D\n122a\nSUTTON, Chief Judge. Edgardo Esteras appeals \nthe district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release \nand sentencing him to 24 months in prison. We affirm the \ndistrict court\u2019s revocation order for the reasons that follow.\nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to \ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0841(a)(1) and 846. Varying \ndownward from a guidelines range of 15 to 21 months, \nthe district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month \nprison term for violating his probation for a prior federal \ndrug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of \nsupervised release.\nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began \nin January 2020. Three years later, in January 2023, \nthe probation officer reported to the district court that \nEsteras had violated the conditions of his supervised \nrelease (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated \nmenacing, and criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing \na firearm. The probation officer notified the district court \nthat the new criminal charges against Esteras had been \ndismissed at the victim\u2019s request.\nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and \nfound that Esteras possessed a firearm while under \nsupervised release. She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous \nsentences for drug crimes and violating an earlier \nsupervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to \nencourage [him] to be respectful of the law.\u201d R.439 at 83. \nBased on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, \n\nAppendix D\n123a\nshe varied upward from an advisory range of six to twelve \nmonths to impose a 24-month jail sentence, \u201clong enough \nto at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d \nId. at 85. She added three years of supervised release to \nthe sentence, including an anger management class and \nsix months of location monitoring. These conditions, Judge \nPearson explained, would teach him to \u201cdo better\u201d and \n\u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d Id.\nEsteras objected that the court should not have \nconsidered the three subfactors identified in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence: \u201cto reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d Id. at 92. \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation \ncertainly is the need for the sentence imposed, to promote \nrespect for the law.\u201d Id. But she added that she also \nconsidered deterrence and community safety, which \nappear in other statutory provisions. She also referenced \nher decision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras \nfrom the average, typical, mine run-type defendant.\u201d Id.\nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope \nthat Esteras would take advantage of this opportunity. She \nacknowledged that some of the conventional features of \nsupervised release could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such \nas location monitoring and other measures that \u201crestrict \n[his] freedom\u201d of movement. Id. She then referred to other \nterms, such as anger management, as \u201cthere to bolster \n[him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d Id. \nat 95-96.\n\nAppendix D\n124a\nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the \nground that the district court relied on prohibited factors \nin sentencing him. We disagree.\nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e). In some \nsettings, district courts have discretion to revoke, \nmodify, or decrease a term of supervised release. Id. In \nother settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon \nas Esteras did here, the district court must revoke the \nindividual\u2019s supervised release. Id. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). Whether at \nthe outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a \nmodified term of supervised release, or in the context of \na required revocation of supervised release, Congress has \ndirected courts to consider certain factors. In the words \nof Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d: \u201cThe court .\u00a0.\u00a0. \nconsider[s] the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)\n(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d Id. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(c); see also id. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification \nof conditions or revocation\u201d of supervised release).\nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full \nrecitation of \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a) that italicizes the factors that \ndistrict courts need not consider in supervised-release \ndeterminations:\nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, \nbut not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) \nof this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall \nconsider\u2014\n\nAppendix D\n125a\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the \noffense;\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C) to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D) to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, \nmedical care, or other correctional \ntreatment in the most effective manner;\n(3) the kinds of sentences available;\n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n(A) the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n\nAppendix D\n126a\n(i) issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States \nCode, subject to any amendments \nmade to such guidelines by act of \nCongress (regardless of whether \nsuch amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing \nCommission into amendments issued \nunder section 994(p) of title 28); and\n(ii) that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B) in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements \nissued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title \n28, United States Code, taking into \naccount any amendments made to such \nguidelines or policy statements by act of \nCongress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n\nAppendix D\n127a\n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet \nto be incorporated by the Sentencing \nCommission into amendments issued \nunder section 994(p) of title 28); and\n(B) that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.\n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of \nsimilar conduct; and\n(7) the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims \nthat \u00a7\u00a03583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations. As \nhe sees it, a district court judge who considers the \nforbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \n\u201crespect for the law,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d \nor \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence. Notably, \nthis argument applies to original supervised-release \n\nAppendix D\n128a\ndecisions, which come immediately on the heels of any \nprison-sentence determination under all of the \u00a7\u00a03553(a) \nfactors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c), as well as to any revocation, \nmodification, or reduction determinations with respect to \nsupervised release, see id. \u00a7\u00a03583(e), (g).\nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument. 498 F.3d \n393, 399-400 (6th Cir. 2007). It provided two explanations: \none textual, one contextual. Textually, Lewis observes \nthat \u00a7\u00a03583 generally gives courts considerable discretion \nover supervised-release decisions after considering the \nlisted factors. Id. at 400. It never says that the court may \nconsider \u201conly\u201d those factors. Id. Congress, as it happens, \nknew how to instruct courts not to consider certain \nsentencing factors, as shown in its express command to \ndisregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison \ntime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment \nis not an appropriate means of promoting correction or \nrehabilitation\u201d).\nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, \nmoreover, Lewis was concerned that this proposed \nbright-line rule was unworkable. Whether in the context \nof an initial or later supervised-release decision, the \npurportedly forbidden considerations mentioned in \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the \npermitted ones. Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400. Take \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\n(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d \nIt aligns with \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature \nand circumstances of the offense.\u201d To think about the one \nrequires the judge to think about the other.\n\nAppendix D\n129a\nOr take \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto \npromote respect for the law.\u201d It meshes with the rationale \nthat revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \n\u201clearn to obey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d \nId. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 709, \n120 S. Ct. 1795, 146 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2000)). Indeed, in this \ncase, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see \nhow she could ignore respect for the law but consider \na defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised \nrelease. To neglect the one dishonors the other.\nOr take \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment \nfor the offense.\u201d Under \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(5), courts must consider \n\u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission. Among other guidance, the Commission \ntells judges to \u201csanction the violator for failing to abide \nby the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d Id. \n(quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 pt. A \u00a7\u00a03(b)). The district court, \nin other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds \nto how severely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s \ntrust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d which it \ncannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated \nsupervised release. United States v. Johnson, 640 F.3d \n195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011). Another enumerated factor tells \na court how to carry out that analysis. Under \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(4)\n(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing Commission\u2019s \nsupervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies \nhow \u201cserious\u201d these violations are and then uses the \ncategorization to determine the length of any prison \nsentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4.\n\nAppendix D\n130a\nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another \nway. Recall that Congress requires courts to consider \nthe same set of factors when first imposing a term of \nsupervised release as when revoking one. 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade \ndistrict courts from considering anything related to \n\u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an \ninitial sentencing either. How would this work? Would \nthe sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after \nimposing a sentence? Then, would she have to start over \nwith a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly \nor implicitly, of considerations related to, say, the \u201crule of \nlaw\u201d? Congress could not have expected courts to wipe \ntheir minds of these concerns when they move from one \ntype of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization. If anything, the \nlanguage points the other way. It specifically allows courts \nto account for the length of a supervised-release term \n\u201cin imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(a).\nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not \nchange matters. 564 U.S. 319, 131 S. Ct. 2382, 180 L. Ed. \n2d 357 (2011). It did not, most critically, arise under this \nstatute. The case dealt with a different sentencing law, one \nwith explicit directions, not uncertain implications. The \nstatute in no uncertain terms says \u201cthat imprisonment is \nnot an appropriate means of promoting .\u00a0.\u00a0. rehabilitation.\u201d \n\nAppendix D\n131a\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a). Consistent with that directive, Tapia \nruled that the statute precludes courts from considering \n\u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time. \u201cOur \nconsideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with \nthe text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a)\u2014and given the clarity of \nthat provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 326.\nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said \nin dicta that \u201ca court may not take account of retribution\u201d \nwhen it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d Id. But \neven taken at face value, this reference does not undermine \nthe district court\u2019s sentence. The provision confirms two \nthings. First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-\nrelease term, retribution should not guide the decision. \nNo one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the \nsort at that point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise. \nSecond, if the defendant violates a term of supervised \nrelease or commits a new crime, the government is put to a \nchoice. If it wishes to exact retribution for the new offense, \nnew charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order. Otherwise, the district court should focus on \nnon-retributive factors in deciding the new sentence and \nthe new term of supervised release. But the district court \nin this instance did not claim a right to exact retribution \nfor this violation or for that matter use the word. As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2) are \nhopelessly over-inclusive, and mere references to things \nlike the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap \nwith it\u2014do not create a procedurally unreasonable \n\nAppendix D\n132a\nsentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence. No such evidence \nexists here. In fact, Tapia confirms the point. It ruled \nfor the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \n\u201cnumber one thing [was] the need to provide treatment\u201d \nand so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d \nId. at 334 (quotations omitted).\nThis understanding of \u00a7\u00a03583(e) accords with the \nanalysis of most other circuits and the outcomes of all of \nthem. The general rule is that courts may invoke factors \nrelated to the three general considerations in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\n(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence. \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st \nCir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) incorporates by \nreference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain \nenumerated subsections of section 3553(a), it does not \nforbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) \nfactors.\u201d); United States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 \n(2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably be \ninterpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness \nof the releasee\u2019s violation, given the other factors that \nmust be considered.\u201d); United States v.

The circuits that have \ndescribed the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible \nwhen used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.

Even under these decisions, \nJudge Pearson acted properly when she considered the \nneed to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d alongside \nthe enumerated \u00a7\u00a03553(a) factors. This \u201chighly relevant\u201d \nconcern clearly speaks to the need to deter Esteras\u2019s \nmisconduct and protect the public from his disregard of \nthe rule of law, to say nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing \nGuideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust. Porter, 974 F.3d at 908-09. All \nin all, it is highly doubtful that the outcome in this case \nwould change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.\nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson \nused the word \u201cpunishment\u201d during the hearing. But this \nreference occurred at the beginning of the sentencing \nphase of the hearing and simply set the stage. In her \n\nAppendix D\n135a\nwords, \u201cI find that the new law violation\u201d occurred and that \nshe may \u201cconsider\u201d \u201cevidence\u201d of it \u201cin the punishment I \nwill issue today.\u201d R.439 at 81. This manner of speaking at \nthe beginning of a sentencing hearing does not remotely \nconvey an intent to impose a retributive sentence in \nthe context of a gun-possession violation that required \n\u201cpunishment\u201d\u2014the revocation of supervised release. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). Likewise, when the judge later \nused the word \u201cpunitive\u201d in describing the conditions of \nsupervised release, R.439 at 95, it was to ensure that \nthe sentence was not too long\u2014that the \u201cdeprivation of \n[Esteras\u2019s] liberty\u201d was \u201cno greater .\u00a0.\u00a0. than is reasonably \nnecessary for the purposes set forth\u201d in the enumerated \n\u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2) sections, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3583(d)(2). Surely, \nshorthand references to \u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d in \nthe context of ensuring a sentence is not too long do not \nconvey a forbidden focus on retribution.\nWe AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation order.\n\nAppendix E\n136a\nAPPENDIX E \u2014 ORDER OF THE UNITED \nSTATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE \nSIXTH CIRCUIT, FILED DECEMBER 20, 2023\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\nCase No. 23-3422\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\nv.\nEDGARDO ESTERAS,\nDefendant-Appellant.\nDecided and Filed: December 20, 2023\nOn Petition for Rehearing En Banc\nUnited States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Ohio at Youngstown.\nNo. 4:14-cr-00425-10\u2014Benita Y. Pearson, District Judge.\nORDER\nBefore: SUTTON, Chief Judge; WHITE and THAPAR, \nCircuit Judges.\nThe court issued an order denying the petition for \nrehearing en banc. MOORE, J. (pp. 3\u20139), delivered a \n\nAppendix E\n137a\nseparate opinion dissenting from the denial of the petition \nfor rehearing en banc. GRIFFIN, J. (pp. 10\u201311), also \ndelivered a separate opinion, in which BLOOMEKATZ, \nJ., joined, dissenting from the denial of the petition for \nrehearing en banc.\nORDER\nThe court received a petition for rehearing en banc. \nThe original panel has reviewed the petition for rehearing \nand concludes that the issues raised in the petition were \nfully considered upon the original submission and decision. \nThe petition then was circulated to the full court. Less \nthan a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing \nen banc.\nTherefore, the petition is denied.\nDISSENT\nKAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge, dissenting \nfrom denial of rehearing en banc.1 The top line of any \n1.\u2002 The court received a petition for rehearing en banc \nconcerning the original order in this case, which followed binding \nSixth Circuit precedent. The petition for rehearing en banc was \ncirculated to the entire court, and less than a majority of the judges \nvoted in favor of rehearing the original order en banc. Following \ncirculation to the full court of the en banc petition, however, the \npanel revised its prior order and circulated it to the en banc court. \nEn banc rehearing of the prior order was warranted, which is why \nI dissent from denial of rehearing en banc. And en banc rehearing \nremains warranted now that the panel is issuing an amended \n\nAppendix E\n138a\nsentence is generally the term of incarceration. What \ncatches the eye is how long the defendant will be in \nprison, not how long the defendant will remain under \ncourt supervision. But in the federal system, supervised \nrelease\u2014the often years\u2019 long period of court supervision \nand restrictions following incarceration\u2014comes with \nthe specter of more time in a cell. Judges may \u201crevoke\u201d \na defendant\u2019s supervised release if a defendant violates \ncourt-ordered conditions, sending the defendant back \nto prison for months or possibly years. After Edgardo \nEsteras spent twelve months in federal prison on his \noriginal term of incarceration, the judge in his case \nsentenced him to 24 more months in prison\u2014double his \noriginal sentence\u2014for violating conditions of supervised \nrelease. R. 439 (Revocation Tr. at 85:13\u201321) (Page ID \n#2887).\nRevocation of supervised release is immensely \nimpactful, and sometimes carries consequences even \ngreater than an original term of incarceration. In \nsentencing Esteras after revoking his supervised release, \nthe district court focused on the retributive purpose \nof the additional term of incarceration. See, e.g., id. at \n81:17\u201322 (Page ID #2883) (explaining what information \ncan be considered \u201cin the punishment I will issue today\u201d \n(emphasis added)); id. at 83:9\u201311 (Page ID #2885) (\u201c[W]\norder, because that revised decision likewise relies on the same \nmistaken precedent. Because both the original and revised orders \nrely on United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), I have \naddressed both in this dissent from denial of rehearing en banc. \nEsteras is of course free to petition for en banc rehearing again, \nnow that the panel has filed a revised and published decision.\n\nAppendix E\n139a\nhat\u2019s been done before isn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter you, \nto encourage you to be respectful of the law, to be law-\nabiding.\u201d (emphasis added)). But the supervised-release \nstatute tells district courts not to consider punishment \nas a purpose when imposing or revoking supervised \nrelease. When defense counsel objected to the district \ncourt\u2019s impermissible consideration of certain statutory \nfactors embodying retributive purposes, the district court \nconfirmed that it relied heavily on \u201cpromot[ing] respect \nfor the law\u201d in reaching its sentence, which represented \nan upward variance. Id. at 92:16\u201318 (Page ID #2894). In \neffect, there is a real chance that Esteras was essentially \npunished twice, raising concerns of a constitutional \ndimension and flagrantly violating Congress\u2019s intent \nin any event. Our precedent that allows district courts \nto consider unenumerated sentencing factors when \nrevoking supervised release, United States v. Lewis, \n498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), relies on atextual reasoning \ndirectly contrary to Congress\u2019s purposes. It is an outlier \namong the circuits. Our failure today to correct Lewis\u2019s \nbasic mistakes usurps Congress\u2019s role, runs afoul of \nrudimentary principles of statutory interpretation, and \nultimately undermines the purposes of supervised release. \nToday\u2019s decision in this case serves only to prolong our \nunfortunate adherence to a mistaken precedent.\nToday\u2019s opinion defends Lewis on two grounds: \u201cone \ntextual, [and] one contextual.\u201d Amended Order at 5. \nNeither ground supports Lewis or today\u2019s decision. The \nstatutory text is clear. It directs district judges to take \naccount of certain sentencing factors, but not others, when \nrevoking supervised release. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e), \n\nAppendix E\n140a\na court \u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d terminate, modify, extend, or revoke a \ndefendant\u2019s term of supervised release. Notably absent \nfrom this list is \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), which directs district \ncourts to consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote \nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the \noffense.\u201d Canons of statutory construction dictate that \nthis omission was intentional and command district courts \nnot to take account of the (a)(2)(A) factors when revoking \nsupervised release. See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant \nCnty. Narcotics Intel. & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. \n163, 168 (1993) (declining to extend Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading \nrequirements to complaints alleging municipal liability \nbecause \u201cthe Federal Rules do address in Rule 9(b) the \nquestion of the need for greater particularity in pleading \ncertain actions, but do not include among the enumerated \nactions any reference to complaints alleging municipal \nliability\u201d); id. (\u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d); \nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (\u201c[W]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it \nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally \nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d \n(quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, \n722 (5th Cir. 1972))).\nSimply put, Lewis and today\u2019s opinion offer no \nexplanation for why Congress deliberately chose to include \nsome, but not all, of the \u00a7\u00a03553(a) factors in \u00a7\u00a03583(e). \nToday\u2019s opinion declares that \u00a7\u00a03583 \u201cgenerally gives \n\nAppendix E\n141a\ncourts considerable discretion over supervised-release \ndecisions after considering the listed factors.\u201d Amended \nOrder at 5 (citing Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400). But neither \nLewis nor the instant opinion can ground this contention in \nthe statutory text. Rather, \u00a7\u00a03583(e) explicitly constrains \nthe exercise of discretion, directing district courts to focus \non only the enumerated factors. Had Congress wished \nfor district courts to consider the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors, \nit would have made \u00a7\u00a03583(e) coterminous with \u00a7\u00a03553(a). \nCongress did not. See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 \nU.S    , 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1813 (2019) (explaining that \ncourts should not rely on the \u201cdoubtful proposition that \nCongress sought to accomplish in a \u2018surpassingly strange \nmanner\u2019 what it could have accomplished in a much more \nstraightforward way\u201d (quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, \nLLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 647 (2012))).\nThe context follows from the text. In Tapia v. \nUnited States, the Supreme Court explained that 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(D) reflects \u201cthe four purposes \nof sentencing generally\u201d: \u201cretribution, deterrence, \nincapacitation, and rehabilitation.\u201d 564 U.S. 319, 325 \n(2011). The statute\u2019s \u201cprovisions make clear that a \nparticular purpose may apply differently, or even not at all, \ndepending on the kind of sentence under consideration.\u201d \nId. at 326. Following the statute\u2019s plain text, \u201ca court \nmay not take account of retribution (the first purpose \nlisted in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised \nrelease.\u201d Id. Section \u00a7\u00a03583(e), which pertains to revoking \nsupervised release, is the mirror-image of \u00a7\u00a0 3583(c), \nwhich pertains to imposing a term of supervised release. \nIt follows that both subsections direct district courts \n\nAppendix E\n142a\nnot to consider retribution when imposing or revoking \nsupervised release.\nFaced with this obvious hurdle, today\u2019s decision \nattempts to rewrite Tapia. Of course, I need not put \nmuch gloss on what Justice Kagan straightforwardly \nsaid in that opinion: a district court cannot rely on the \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors when making decisions concerning \nsupervised release. Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. Today\u2019s \ndecision attempts to skirt this plain statement through \ntwo paragraphs of explanation of what Justice Kagan \nsupposedly must have meant. I, like Justice Kagan, \nprefer to rely on the actual text of the statute. In any \nevent, today\u2019s attempt to square what the district court did \nwith Tapia is futile. For one, today\u2019s opinion gets its facts \nwrong. It says in conclusory words that no one has shown \nthat the district judge let retribution guide the decision. \nAmended Order at 7. Most obviously, Esteras has. Pet. \nRehearing En Banc at 10 (\u201cThe district court expressly \nrelied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014specifically, the \nneed to punish and to promote respect for the law\u2014when \nrevoking Esteras\u2019 supervised release.\u201d (emphasis added)). \nAnd this assertion of the panel is belied by the plain words \nthe district court used in the proceeding, which sounded in \nretribution. Like its take on Tapia, today\u2019s decision would \nrather reconceptualize the very words the district court \nused\u2014\u201cpunishment\u201d and \u201cpunitive\u201d\u2014and chalk them \nup to \u201cset[ting] the stage\u201d rather than an error on the \npart of the district court. Of course, \u201csetting the stage\u201d \nby thinking of the sentence in terms of punishment is \nprecisely what a district court must not do per the text of \nthe statute. To the extent that Tapia explains that taking \n\nAppendix E\n143a\nthe \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors into account necessarily means \ntaking retribution into account, today\u2019s decision\u2019s myopic \nfocus on a word here or there entirely misses the point.\nTapia is also instructive on statute-drafting more \nbroadly. But once again, today\u2019s decision would rather \nignore its clear import. Today\u2019s decision suggests that \nunless Congress enacts a separate statutory provision \nforbidding district courts to take account of certain \nfactors, as it did in \u00a7\u00a03582(a), the purposeful omissions \nin \u00a7\u00a03583(c) and (e) are meaningless. Yet Congress can \naccomplish its statutory purposes in a variety of ways, \nas Tapia recognizes. Again, the only understanding of \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e) that gives effect to its plain text is that explained \nby Tapia.\nThat retributive concerns are not to be taken into \naccount reflects Congress\u2019s judgment of the purpose \nof supervised release. The relevant legislative history \nexplicitly states that \u201cthe sentencing purposes of \nincapacitation and punishment would not be served by \na term of supervised release\u2014that the primary goal of \nsuch a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s transition into the \ncommunity.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98-225, at *124 (1983); see \nalso Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 708\u201309 \n(2000) (citing the Senate Report and discussing the \npurpose of supervised release). By contrast, taking the \nretributive \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account when \nimposing or revoking supervised release contravenes \nthis congressional purpose and also creates \u201cserious \nconstitutional questions .\u00a0.\u00a0. by construing revocation \nand reimprisonment as punishment for the violation \n\nAppendix E\n144a\nof the conditions of supervised release.\u201d Johnson, 529 \nU.S. at 700. The Sentencing Guidelines confirm this \nunderstanding: revocation of supervised release is not \nmeant to \u201csubstantially duplicate the sanctioning role \nof the court with jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s new \ncriminal conduct,\u201d but instead to \u201csanction primarily \nthe defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d U.S. Sent\u2019g Guidelines \nManual Ch. 7A Intro. (U.S. Sent\u2019g Comm\u2019n 2023).\nNo doubt, there is some level of overlap between \nthe factors district courts must consider when revoking \nsupervised release, and those that a district court cannot \nconsider. See Lewis, 498 F. 3d at 400 (explaining that a \ndistrict court likely takes into account the seriousness of \nan offense when considering the nature and circumstances \nof the offense). But today\u2019s opinion treats this reality\u2014\nthat there is some degree of overlap\u2014as a virtue, \nmanifestly dishonoring Congress\u2019s decision to omit the \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors from consideration. Amended \nOrder at 6 (\u201cTo think about the one requires the judge to \nthink about the other.\u201d); id. (\u201cTo neglect the one dishonors \nthe other.\u201d). That a district court may consider, to some \ndegree, the seriousness of the offense, however, does not \njustify allowing district courts to disregard Congress\u2019s \nmandate that retributive concerns should not influence \nthe overall sentence. Put differently, the overlap problem \nfirst identified by Lewis is exaggerated to the extent that \na district court can avoid running afoul of the statute \nby avoiding viewing revocation of supervised release as \nretribution.\n\nAppendix E\n145a\nPerhaps recognizing the futility of any text-based \nargument, today\u2019s decision reinvents the overlap argument \nin the form of a strawman. It suggests that Congress \ncannot possibly have meant that district courts should \nnot rely on the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking \nsupervised release, because \u201cCongress requires courts to \nconsider the same set of factors when first imposing a term \nof supervised release as when revoking one.\u201d Amended \nOrder at 6. Per today\u2019s decision, district courts would be \nforced to \u201cadjourn the hearing after imposing a[n] [initial] \nsentence\u201d and \u201cstart over with a new unblemished inquiry \ninto the right term of supervised release\u201d so as to not \nmistakenly consider the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. This \nargument is disingenuous. What the statute requires\nis that district courts not view supervised release as \nan additional punishment, and that district courts adjust \ntheir rationale and considerations accordingly when \nimposing or revoking supervised release. The district \ncourt manifestly failed to do that here.\nWhat is more, some degree of overlap cannot explain \naway Congress\u2019s explicit choice to omit certain sentencing \nfactors from consideration when revoking supervised \nrelease. In this way, the analyses of Lewis and today\u2019s \nopinion are self-defeating. If Congress believed that courts \nwould inevitably consider the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nrevoking supervised release, it would not have omitted \nsuch factors from \u00a7\u00a03583. Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400. The same \nis true if Congress affirmatively wanted district courts \nto consider such factors. Id. at 399\u2013400. Regardless, \nbare judicial pragmatism cannot overcome the plain text \nof the statute, which directs district courts not to take \n\nAppendix E\n146a\nretributive sentencing factors into account. United States \nv. Tohono O\u2019Odham Nation, 563 U.S. 307, 317 (2011) (\u201c[C]\nonsiderations of policy divorced from the statute\u2019s text and \npurpose could not override its meaning.\u201d).\nBeyond these fundamental errors, en banc \nreconsideration is warranted because the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \napproach is an outlier among the circuit courts. Lewis and \ntoday\u2019s opinion are entirely untethered from the statutory \ntext, and it would appear that they allow a district court \nto rely exclusively on the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nrevoking supervised release. Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399\u2013400 \n(holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to \nconsider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for \nviolation of supervised release, even though this factor \nis not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a03583(e)\u201d). In other words, our \ncases contain no limits and allow district courts to \ndisregard \u00a7\u00a03583(e) in toto. Though there is a circuit split \non this issue, most circuits would find that a revocation of \nsupervised release principally based on the \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\n(A) factors is procedurally unreasonable. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1260 (10th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[I]t \nis procedural error to consider an unenumerated [\u00a7\u00a03553(a)\n(2)(A)] factor.\u201d); United States v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173, \n1182\u201383 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201cmere reference\u201d \nto unenumerated \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be \nreversible error, but that further consideration of such \nfactors when revoking supervised release is procedurally \nunreasonable); United States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012, \n1017 (5th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[A] sentencing error occurs when an \nimpermissible consideration is a dominant factor in the \ncourt\u2019s revocation sentence.\u201d); United States v. Young, \n\nAppendix E\n147a\n634 F.3d 233, 241 (3rd Cir. 2011) (recognizing that \nconsideration of unenumerated \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwould not be reversible per se error, but that \u201cthere may \nbe a case where a court places undue weight on the\u201d \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors); United States v. Webb, 738 F.3d \n638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominately on the \n[\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude that mere reference \nto such considerations does not render a revocation \nsentence procedurally unreasonable.\u201d); United States v. \nClay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e now join \nthe majority of circuits that have faced this issue and rule \nthat this subsection [\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)] may be considered so \nlong as the district court relies primarily on [enumerated] \nfactors.\u201d (emphasis added)). Lewis appears expressly \nto adopt punishment as a valid rationale for revoking \nsupervised release, directly contrary to the statute and \nCongress\u2019s intent. 498 F.3d at 400 (\u201c[A]lthough violations \nof supervised release generally do not entail conduct as \nserious as crimes punishable under the \u00a7\u00a03553(a) regime, \nrevocation sentences are similarly intended to \u2018sanction,\u2019 \nor, analogously, to \u2018provide just punishment for the offense\u2019 \nof violating supervised release.\u201d).\nLewis and today\u2019s decision bulldoze over each \nand every indication of congressional intent available \nin favor of an explicitly policy-driven outcome. That \nincludes plain text, legislative history, and information \nfrom the Sentencing Commission. \u201c[D]eference to the \nsupremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that \nCongress[members] typically vote on the language of a \nbill, generally requires us to assume that \u2018the legislative \n\nAppendix E\n148a\npurpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the \nwords used.\u2019\u201d United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 \n(1985) (quoting Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 9 \n(1962)). Here, this deference requires that district courts \nhonor Congress\u2019s explicit choice that supervised release \nnot be an additional punishment, and that district courts \nadjust their rationale and considerations accordingly. \nThe district court failed to do that here. It plainly viewed \nrevocation of supervised release as punishment, and \nsentenced Esteras to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment based on \nimpermissible sentencing factors.

DUSTIN: And I think we previously\u2014and I \nwould formally, on the record, dismiss violation number \nthree with respect to the cocaine for Mr. Watters. \nTHE COURT: Because?\nMS. DUSTIN: Because it was in a common area in \nthe house where there was a lot of people in and out, so I \ndon\u2019t think we can necessarily prove it.\nTHE COURT: Even constructive?\nMS. DUSTIN: I think it would be best to let that one \ngo.\nMR. SCHUMAN: We expressed some reservation \nabout it too in the bond hearing.\nMS. DUSTIN: There was construction workers in \nand out, it was on top of a cabinet, so there were a lot of \npeople in the house.\nTHE COURT: What was it they were convicted of?\n\nAppendix G\n157a\n[3]MS. DUSTIN: Both of them, they were indicted \nfor felony position of marijuana. They pled guilty to \nmisdemeanor possession of marijuana. They were \nsentenced to 180 days.\nTHE COURT: Time served?\nMR. WAGNER: No contest plea.\nTHE COURT: Good enough.\nMS. STERLING: Judge, just to be clear, it\u2019s Alissa. \nEverything you just heard was accurate.\nTHE COURT: Believe it or not, unlike once before \nI can tell the difference.

STERLING: When Shawna was here, Judge \nnever knew if it was me or Shawna.\nMR. WAGNER: I spoke to him one time out of here \nfor about ten or 15 minutes, and he said, Pete, that\u2019s you, \nisn\u2019t it, and I had to remember what did I say.\n\nAppendix G\n158a\nMS. STERLING: So both of the defendants were\u2014of \ncourse they were together on the January 14th incident. \nThere are a number of violations for Mr. Carrizales \nrelated to that. He also entered a no contest plea to a [4]\nmisdemeanor and was convicted, but he has additional \nviolations that predate that. That includes a felony \nconviction that he went to jury trial on, and ultimately \nto prison. So I just want to make sure you\u2019re aware his \nguideline is different, and he has seven violations instead \nof three.\nTHE COURT: And the other thing is he\u2019s completed \nthe prison time?\nPROBATION: Yes.\nMS.

DUSTIN: We said that if he pled guilty, the \nmisdemeanor would be grade C. Doesn\u2019t mean the conduct \nwon\u2019t constitute something higher. It is technically a grade \nC, and I think probation will verify that. Doesn\u2019t stop me \n\nAppendix G\n159a\nfrom arguing for higher because technically his conduct \nwould be more, but technically, yeah, it\u2019s a grade C.\n(A brief recess was taken.)\n[5]COURTROOM DEPUTY: The Court is now in \nsession before the Honorable James G.

I\u2019ll swear you in.\nTIMOTHY WATTERS,\nJOSE CARRIZALES,\nwas herein, called as if upon examination, was first duly \nsworn, as hereinafter certified, and said as follows:\nTHE COURT: So you can remain seated.\nLet me say, where are we in terms of procedure? Have \nwe had probable cause, we\u2019re now at adjudication, or do I \n\nAppendix G\n160a\nbegin from square one? Doesn\u2019t matter to me, I just want \nto make sure I get the procedure right.\nMS. STERLING: It\u2019s my understanding we are ready \n[6]for adjudication. Mr. Carrizales waived his right to a \npreliminary hearing over a year ago.\nMr. Watters exercised his right to a hearing, and this \nCourt found probable cause.\nWe\u2019re now ready for adjudication on both cases.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And it\u2019s my understanding that \neach have been charged in a higher felony level, and each \npled to a reduced charge, got 180 days time served, and \nhere we are; is that correct?\nMR. WAGNER: That is correct, Your Honor, on behalf \nof\u2014\nTHE COURT: I can\u2019t quite hear.\nMR. WAGNER: I\u2019m sorry. Relative to Mr. Carrizales, \nwe did tender a plea in Lucas County Common Pleas Court \nto a misdemeanor and got time served, 180 days.\nTHE COURT: Now, it\u2019s my understanding that \nengaging the guideline range, I\u2019m not bound by whatever \nThe State Court did, but I can look to the actual conduct \nin terms of determining the guideline range. Ms. Sterling, \nis that correct?\n\nAppendix G\n161a\nMS. STERLING: That is correct, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And I\u2019ve read the violation \nreports, and you\u2019ve gone over the violation reports with \nyour clients, correct, Mr. Wagner and Mr. Schuman?\nMR. WAGNER: Yes, Your Honor.\n[7]MR. SCHUMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Carrizales, are you familiar with \nthe allegations contained in the violation reports? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Watters?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And are you each fully and \ncompletely satisfied that, Mr. Schuman, you, as to Mr. \nWatters, and you, Mr. Wagner, as to Mr. Carrizales, \neach of them has given you and your case enough time \nand attention to prepare you thoroughly for today\u2019s \nprocedures?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: You can remain seated, that\u2019s fine. If, \nfor no other reason, you\u2019ve got to be about this distance \n\nAppendix G\n162a\nfrom the microphone for anybody to hear anything, \nincluding myself, so I have to keep remembering to lean \nforward.\nAnd during the course of their work with you relative \nto these violations, have\u2014Mr. Watters, has Mr. Schuman \nat any time\u2014have you asked him to do something and he \nhasn\u2019t done it? Do you understand my question?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Oh, no, no.\nMR. SCHUMAN: That I failed to do.\n[8]THE COURT: Mr. Carrizales, how about yourself, \nany time, during the course of the pendency of these \nproceedings, have you asked Mr. Wagner to do something \non your behalf with regard to the pending allegations and \nhe simply refused or failed to do it?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: And Mr. Watters, are you satisfied that \nMr. Schuman has given you and this whole proceeding \nenough time and attention to prepare both himself and \nyou thoroughly for today\u2019s proceeding?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Carrizales, likewise, relative to \nMr. Wagner, are you thoroughly and completely satisfied \nthat Mr. Wagner has given you and your case enough time \nand attention to prepare both you and him thoroughly and \ncompletely for today\u2019s hearing?\n\nAppendix G\n163a\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: I gather, counsel, you\u2019ve had the \nopportunity to get together with the prosecutor and find \nout from the prosecutor, or otherwise, the underlying\u2014\nwhat contentions, what allegations support the allegations \nrelative to the alleged violations? In other words, have \nyou learned, to the best of your understanding, as much, \nor just about as much about what the government\u2014what \nthe government has in its hands by way of investigatory \nreports [9]and so forth relative to these allegations, that \nyou have learned, by examination of the prosecutor, \nmaterials, according to your understanding, what the \nprosecutor knows about the allegations and the incident?\nMR. WAGNER: Yes, Your Honor, on behalf of Mr. \nCarrizales.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Yes, Your Honor, on behalf of Mr. \nWatters.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Okay, so I think we now proceed\u2014\nand neither, I gather, is admitting the allegations, and \nthat\u2019s fine, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. No problem at all.\nMS. STERLING: That is actually not correct, Your \nHonor. I believe we have a resolution as to both cases. \nI\u2019m happy to put forth the resolution as it relates to Mr. \nCarrizales, and I believe Ms. Dustin can do the statement \nfor Mr. Watters.\nAs it relates to Mr. Carrizales, there were actually \nseven different violations contained in the reports. After \n\nAppendix G\n164a\ndiscussing the matter with his counsel Mr. Wagner, the \ngovernment, at this time, would move The Court to dismiss \nviolation number one and violation number six. And with \nthat, it\u2019s my understanding that Mr. Carrizales is going \nto enter an admission to the remaining violations. He \nunderstands that violation number [10]three in particular, \nwhich includes a felony conviction, does carry with it a \nstatutory maximum of five-years imprisonment. And \nadmissions to the remaining violations carries with it, I \nbelieve, a statutory of three years\u2014maximum of three \nyears.\nTHE COURT: Why don\u2019t we start with this, and I\u2019m \ngoing to ask Mr. Carrizales if it is correct that that\u2019s being \ndismissed, according to his understanding at least, the \ngovernment will move to dismiss it.\nAnd then as to each being admitted, if you\u2019ll recite \nwhat that is, and I\u2019ll ask whether or not that\u2019s being \nadmitted.\nAnd before I do that, Mr. Carrizales, did anyone \npromise you anything for whatever admissions you may \nbe making this afternoon relative to the alleged violations, \npromise you anything of benefit, promise anybody close to \nyou anything of benefit, anything of benefit at all?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: And did anybody threaten you with \nany kind of harm, or somebody close to you\u2014threaten \nsomebody close to you with harm, personal, physical, \n\nAppendix G\n165a\nfinancial, any sort of harm, to cause you to admit, if you \ndo so, whatever you admit to today?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: And promises weren\u2019t made of any sort \n[11]whatsoever to you, correct?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir. \nTHE COURT: Not by the government? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir. \nTHE COURT: By Mr. Wagner? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir. \nTHE COURT: By anybody else? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: Likewise, with threats, nobody from \nthe government made any threats; is that correct? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Wagner make any threats? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: And nobody else, correct? \n\nAppendix G\n166a\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Ms. Sterling, as to the first \nalleged violation?\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor. The first \nviolation, again, the government would move to dismiss.\nThe second violation\u2014\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m just curious, what is that? I don\u2019t \nhave them in front of me. I read them, but my memory\u2019s \nnot that good.\nMS. STERLING: Certainly, Your Honor. On \nSeptember 10th, 2018, Mr. Carrizales was arrested by \nthe [12]Perrysburg Police Department and charged with \nassault, domestic violence, theft, and robbery.\nTHE COURT: And that\u2019s being dismissed; is that \ncorrect?\nMS. STERLING: It is, Your Honor, because, as alleged \nin violation number three, he was in\u2014he was arrested on \nan additional felony charge, and the prosecutor there \nopted to proceed to trial on that charge. I do not see where \nthe indictment was ever returned on violation number one.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Was a charge filed?\nMS. STERLING: A charge was filed in the Municipal \nCourt. It appears it was bound over. But, again, I don\u2019t \nsee where it was ever presented to a grand jury.\n\nAppendix G\n167a\nTHE COURT: Okay. And there\u2019s no facts presently \navailable, to wit it\u2019s being dismissed, so on motion of the \ngovernment, that violation will be dismissed.\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAs to violation number two, on October 6th of 2018, \nMr. Carrizales was cited for operating a motor vehicle \nwhile under the influence, driving under suspension, and \nreckless driving. He later entered a no contest plea to an \namended charge, specifically a physical control of a vehicle \nwhile under the influence, a [13]misdemeanor of the first \ndegree in the Toledo Municipal Court, and was given a \nsentence of time served.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Carrizales, is that correct?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And at the time you were stopped or \nfound by the police, you, so far as you understood it, were \nabove the legal limit in terms of blood alcohol or whatever?\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, there were extenuating \ncircumstances, and if The Court would inquire.\nTHE COURT: Absolutely. I\u2019m just going through\u2014\nwe\u2019ll get to disposition when I decide what to do about \nit. But both defendants and both attorneys will have an \nopportunity to be heard, by all means. But you do admit \nthose all\u2014those allegations of fact as recited by the \nprosecutor, is that correct?\n\nAppendix G\n168a\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. There\u2019ll be a finding, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that is violations found to \nhave occurred.\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAs to violation number three, on November 22nd of \n2018, Mr. Carrizales was arrested by the Perrysburg \nPolice Department and charged with domestic violence, \nfelonious [14]assault, grand theft, assault, and aggravated \nmenacing. An indictment was later returned by the grand \njury in Wood County for felonious assault. Mr. Carrizales \nproceeded to jury trial on the matter and was found guilty \nof an attempted felonious assault, a felony of the third \ndegree. Later sentenced to serve a term of 36 months in \nthe Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections.\nTHE COURT: And that term has been served?\nMS. STERLING: Yes, Your Honor. He was released \nfrom that term, I believe, November 3rd of 2021.\nTHE COURT: At the time the incident that brings \nhim here, that violation number three, was he on any form \nof post release control, parole, whatever?\nMS. STERLING: He was on supervised release with \nthis Court. Are you asking me if he was on\u2014\nTHE COURT: State Court as well?\n\nAppendix G\n169a\nMS. STERLING: Yes, mandatory post release control, \nas I understand.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Do you know whether a detainer\u2019s \nbeen lodged with regard to that, or a violation notice as to \nthat been filed with the Adult Parole Board or whomever?\nMS. STERLING: I do not.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Wagner, do you know \nwhether your client is subject to\u2014\n[15]MR. WAGNER: No, he was released from custody, \nYour Honor, and we have no knowledge, nor have we been \nadvised as to any subsequent detention.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And is there any\u2014are you able \nto\u2014looking at the date, do you have the police reports \nof that incident, or can you represent to me, as an officer \nof The Court, your understanding of the underlying \nfacts, particularly with regard to any assaultive conduct \nupon the victim? Can you tell me a little bit about what \nhappened, please?\nMS. STERLING: I have\u2014I have not personally \nreviewed the police reports. I can tell you that the violation \nreport filed by this Court\u2019s probation department indicates \nthat police reports provided by the Perrysburg Police \nDepartment indicates that the police responded to a call \nof a fight between a male and a female at an address on \nOregon Road in Perrysburg Township. The officer spoke \nwith the victim, and she reported that she was punched \n\nAppendix G\n170a\nand choked by Mr. Carrizales, after which he took her \nkeys and left the residence with her minivan.\nTHE COURT: And Mr. Wagner, to the best of \nyour understanding, did Ms. Sterling substantially \nand accurately recite your understanding of what the \nPerrysburg Police Department report indicates?\nMR. WAGNER: We would not quarrel with the police \n[16]report. However, we have considerable mitigation with \nrespect to certain circumstances.\nTHE COURT: Sure. I\u2019ll hear you out on that in \nmitigation, okay. But in any event, as to violation number \nthree, is there any objection, Mr. Carrizales, to the \nrecitation of the violation itself, setting aside for now \nthe Perrysburg Police Department reports, that the \nviolation, as stated in the violation report, do you admit \nthose allegations?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes.\nTHE COURT: Pardon me?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. There\u2019ll be a finding as to that \nviolation.\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMoving on to violation number four. On January 14th \nof 2022, Mr. Carrizales was charged with trafficking with \n\nAppendix G\n171a\nmarijuana, a felony of the fourth degree. At that time \nthe case was charged in the Toledo Municipal Court, he \nwas subsequently indicted by the Lucas County grand \njury, and, as I believe you\u2019re aware, he recently entered \na no contest plea and was found guilty to an attempted \ntrafficking in marijuana charge, a misdemeanor of the \nfirst degree related to that case.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And Mr. Carrizales, is that [17]\ncorrect with regard to what she\u2019s just recited?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Now, if you can, can you please \ngive me the details about the government\u2019s understanding \nof the underlying conduct?\nMS. STERLING: Certainly, Your Honor. As if relates \nto Mr. Carrizales, appears that the Toledo Metro Drug \nTask Force completed a traffic stop on a vehicle that \nMr. Carrizales, Mr. Watters, and I believe Mr. Watters\u2019 \nbrother, Tommy Watters, were all three located in the \nvehicle, the vehicle being registered to Mr. Timothy \nWatters. Officers noted that the windows were down, \nand a scent that resembled marijuana was coming from \nthe vehicle. All three individuals were asked to exit the \nvehicle at that time. Located under the rear seat where Mr. \nCarrizales was seated was a large white garbage bag that \nwas seen in plain view which contained two large plastic \nbags filled with suspected marijuana, at which time all \nthree individuals were taken into custody.\n\nAppendix G\n172a\nThat marijuana was later sent to The State Crime \nLab, BCI, where it did return, after a chemical analysis, \na positive result of marijuana weighing just under a \nkilogram, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Wagner, does your client \ndispute the accuracy of that recitation?\n[18]MR. WAGNER: We do not dispute the accuracy \nof the police report.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Is that correct, Mr. Carrizales?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. There\u2019ll be a finding as to that, \nand also as to the facts recited about the nature of the \nsubstance and its weight.\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMR. WAGNER: And the disposition, Your Honor? \nTHE COURT: Pardon?\nMR. WAGNER: And the ultimate disposition? \nTHE COURT: Yeah, of course, and the ultimate \ndisposition, yeah. Yeah.\nMS. STERLING: As to violation number five, a \nrandom urinalysis drug test was administered by this \n\nAppendix G\n173a\nCourt\u2019s probation department on December 9th of 2021 \nwith presumptively positive for marijuana. Test was sent \nfor confirmatory testing and returned a positive result on \nDecember 30th of 2021.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Carrizales, is that correct?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Do you admit that violation? \nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\n[19]THE COURT: Okay. There\u2019ll be a finding.\nMS. STERLING: Again, Your Honor, as to violation \nnumber six, which had to do with failure to notify the \nprobation officer of a change of residence, government\u2019s \nmoving to dismiss that violation.\nTHE COURT: Okay. That will be dismissed.\nMS. STERLING: Finally, as to violation number \nseven, alleges contact with known felons or others \nengaged in criminal activity. That relates back to the \nJanuary 14th of 2022 traffic stop where the marijuana \nwas seized, because Mr. Carrizales was in the vehicle with \nMr. Watters and his brother, both of whom he knows are \nconvicted felons because they are co-defendants on the \nunderlying case in this matter.\nTHE COURT: That correct, Mr. Carrizales? \n\nAppendix G\n174a\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And, Mr. Carrizales, at the time did \nyou know that you were prohibited from possessing \nunlawful possession of Controlled Substances?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And did you also know that you were \nsupposed to report any contact with the police?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And also did you know you\u2019re not \nsupposed to be in the company of anyone known to you \nor [20]believed by you to be a felon?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And you also know that you were \nprohibited from committing any further violations of law? \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Did you understand, at the time, that I \ncould find a violation, regardless of whether other judicial \nproceedings had occurred relative to the underlying \nconduct?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir. \nTHE COURT: Pardon me?\n\nAppendix G\n175a\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Anything further I should ask with \nregard to his familiarity with the conditions of release, \nand, Ms. Sterling, whether or not his conduct\u2014so I can \nassess whether or not his conduct violated any such \ncondition?\nMS. STERLING: No, Your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: There\u2019ll be a finding that the referenced \nconditions\u2014the conduct as to which I found a violation, \nthere will also be a finding that the referenced conditions \nconstitute a violation of the terms and conditions of \nsupervised release. Again, we next will proceed as to \nMr. Carrizales with regard to the appropriate sanctions.\n[21]Now as to Mr. Watters?\nMS. DUSTIN: Your Honor, I\u2019ll address Mr. Watters.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMS. DUSTIN: Mr. Watters was originally charged in \na violation report with four violations.\nThe first violation was a new law violation that \nessentially cited that on January 14th, 2022, Mr. Watters \nwas charged with trafficking in drugs marijuana, a felony \nof the fourth degree, and trafficking in drugs, cocaine, \nfelony of the fourth degree in Toledo Municipal Court.\n\nAppendix G\n176a\nUltimately the defendant was only indicted for \nthe trafficking in marijuana. He was not indicted for \ntrafficking cocaine in Lucas County Common Pleas Court. \nAnd on February 6th, 2023, Mr. Watters withdrew his plea \nof not guilty and entered a plea of no contest to the lesser \nincluded offense of attempted trafficking in marijuana, \na misdemeanor of the first degree. He was found guilty, \nand he was sentenced to 180 days with credit for all time \nserved, and he agreed to forfeit $740.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Watters, do you acknowledge \nthat occurred?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And do you, likewise, acknowledge \nthat, at the time of that conduct, you knew [22]that you \nwere prohibited from possession of any Controlled \nSubstance?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And that, likewise, you were prohibited, \nunder the supervised release requirements, from \ncommitting any further violation of law?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And do you, likewise, agree that the \namount of Controlled Substance was as Ms. Sterling has \npreviously indicated?\n\nAppendix G\n177a\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN: Yes, Your Honor. We would rely on \nthe recitation of facts that AUSA Sterling provided with \nrespect to Mr. Carrizales.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Excuse me, there will be a \nfinding as to that violation.\nMS. DUSTIN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWith respect to the next violation, he was in association \nwith convicted felons. Mr. Watters\u2019 violation states that \non January 14th, Mr. Watters was alleged to be found in \na vehicle with Tommy Watters and Jose Carrizales, co-\ndefendants from the instant offense, the original offense \nthat he was on supervised release for. It\u2019s my recollection \nit\u2019s been, you know, probably a year since this started, \nthat Mr. Watters may have already admitted to [23]this \nviolation. Is that right, Mr. Schuman, at some point? But, \nif not, we should make the record clear.\nTHE COURT: Why don\u2019t we assume not just for the\u2014\nMR. SCHUMAN: I did it in a pleading, Your Honor, \nbut we\u2019ll admit today it was a matter of legal strategy. \nTHE COURT: Okay. Well, in any event, Mr. Watters, \nyou were in the company of Mr. Carrizales; is that correct?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix G\n178a\nTHE COURT: You knew him to be a felon?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And you also were in the company of \nyour brother who you knew to be a felon?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Quite candidly, I never thought about \nthis before, but when one has a sibling, I would assume \nif they were living together or whatever\u2014I\u2019m not going \nthere, obviously, you were abroad in the night season \nengaged in other illegal conduct, but there will be a finding \nas to that violation under the circumstances here. If they \nwere found together living in the same family home or \nwhatever, but that\u2019s not what we have here, so there\u2019ll be \na finding as to that conduct and those violations.\nMS. DUSTIN: The next violation, number three, \n[24]was possession of a Controlled Substance. This, in \nsummary, charged that Mr. Watters\u2014there was some \ncocaine, multiple baggies of cocaine base located at his \nresidence on Lewis Street in Toledo on January 14th, 2022. \nAt this time we would move to dismiss that violation. I also \nhad indicated the government would do so in document\u2014\nTHE COURT: I couldn\u2019t quite hear you, also \nindicate\u2014\nMS. DUSTIN: We had indicated\u2014the government \nindicated in document 356, filed on July 1st, 2022, that \nwe would dismiss that violation.\n\nAppendix G\n179a\nTHE COURT: Okay. That relates to the cocaine found \nat the residence, but I believe it was on the record before \nwe formally began the proceeding, that you indicated \nthat there was simply no way one could properly or \nlawfully, although arguably, attribute the possession of \nthat contraband to Mr. Watters, and that\u2019s fine. So that \nwill be withdrawn and dismissed.\nMS. DUSTIN: Next, with respect to violation four, \npossession of drug paraphernalia. The report charges that \na search warrant was executed on Mr. Watters previous \naddress of 5437, 311th Street, Toledo, Ohio on January \n14th, 2022. And during the search, officers located a press. \nEssentially, this would be a press that\u2019s [25]often used \nin drug trafficking. It\u2019s considered drug paraphernalia \nused to press drugs. And Agent Fulmer, who\u2019s here today, \ncan testify that that press was swiped with a\u2014it\u2019s called \na NIK test, and it returned showing the presence of a \nControlled Substance, specifically cocaine. We have a\u2014we \nhave photographs of the press with a photograph of the \nwipe next to it if this Court would like to see it.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Has that been marked? \nMS. DUSTIN: Yes.\nTHE COURT: First of all, has it been shown to \ndefense counsel?\nMS. DUSTIN: They have had complete discovery in \nthis case.\n\nAppendix G\n180a\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Schuman, you know what \nshe\u2019s talking about?\nMR. SCHUMAN: Yes, I do, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Any objection to having the photograph \nmarked and admitted?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Is there\u2014you indicated there was a \ntest or formal test results?\nMS. DUSTIN: They\u2019re not formal test results, Your \nHonor. In fact, they\u2019re Exhibits 3 and 4 that were E-mailed \nto Ms. Damoah earlier today or yesterday. I do [26]have \na copy if The Court would like to look at it. There is an \nexhibit\u2014Government\u2019s Exhibit 3 depicts the press in the \nbasement of the residence. Government Exhibit 4 depicts \nthe wipe that shows a different color on top of a press. And \nI can present those to you if you\u2019d like. Agent Fulmer is \nhere if you\u2019d like any explanation.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Any objection to those being \nmarked as exhibits and being viewed by me?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Schuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, Your Honor. Thank you. \n\nAppendix G\n181a\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY: I\u2019m sorry, Judge, I never \nreceived those documents.\nTHE COURT: I think they\u2019re coming right now.\nMS. STERLING: They were sent to chambers, ladies, \nI think last night, like\u2014I sent them to counsel at the same \ntime. I\u2019m not sure\u2014towards the end of the day.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019ll see them in a little bit \nout of the corner of my eye with my glasses.\nMS. STERLING: Tina, I\u2019m happy to resend if you \ncan pull it up for Judge.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Schuman, have you seen these? \nMR. SCHUMAN: I have, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN: Judge, the NIK test is like a field [27]\ntest. It\u2019s not\u2014\nTHE COURT: Sure. I understand.\nMS. DUSTIN: It\u2019s not formal.\nTHE COURT: And indicated the presence of what? \nMS. DUSTIN: Cocaine.\nTHE COURT: Cocaine, okay. Any objection to my \nconsideration of these exhibits?\n\nAppendix G\n182a\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: I just want the record to show, as you \nall know, I\u2019ve got a pretty severe vision issue. What\u2019s right \nin front of me, these are large exhibits, and I can see them \njust fine. Thank you.\nJust for the record, if you can just tell me, and also, for \nthe record, I just want to make sure\u2014Number 3 I gather \nis what? The press?\nMS. DUSTIN: Yes, and then 4 has the swipe that \nshows\u2014\nTHE COURT: Right.\nMS. DUSTIN:\u2014the top of the press where it was\u2014\nwhere it was\u2014where it returned as positive.\nTHE COURT: And that\u2019s the indicator of the presence \nof cocaine?\nMS. DUSTIN: A field test, yes.\nTHE COURT: Thanks. They\u2019ll be admitted. Okay. \nMS. DUSTIN: And that\u2019s the only violation left [28]\nwith respect to Mr. Watters.\nTHE COURT: Okay. And which violation was that \nagain?\n\nAppendix G\n183a\nMS. DUSTIN: That was number four.\nTHE COURT: And there will\u2014any objection to my \nmaking a finding as to violation four, that\u2019s the allegation \nby the government, in light of those allegations, a finding \nof violation of the prohibition against the possession of \nControlled Substance?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No objection.\nMS. DUSTIN: I think Mr. Watters has to formally \nadmit to that violation.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN: Mr. Watters I don\u2019t believe has formally \nadmitted to that violation.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Watters, do you admit to that \nviolation?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. So in light of the evidence, the \nviolations, and the findings of violations of conditions of \nsupervised release, I think we next proceed to consider \nwhat I do about it. Correct me\u2014the guideline range as \nto each defendant is?\nMS. STERLING: Your Honor, as to Mr. Carrizales, \nthe guideline range for violation number three, which \nwas [29]the felony, attempted felonious assault, 51 to the \n\nAppendix G\n184a\nstatutory maximum of 60 months. As to the remaining \nviolations for Mr. Carrizales, the guideline range is 33 to \n41 months.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Carrizales, you understand \nthat I am to look at the Federal Sentencing Guidelines? I\u2019m \nnot bound to them. I cannot go higher than the guideline \nrange as to the possession counts simply because that\u2019s the \nmaximum, 60-month maximum. But do you understand \nthat, in considering, I have to look at the\u2014I have to \nconsider whether or not you remain in the range; and as \nto the other one, go higher, or as to both of them impose a \nsanction of less than the guideline range? You understand \nthat\u2019s my discretion?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m required by federal law to look \nat them, consider them, and go from there. Do you \nunderstand that?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Watters\u2014as to Mr. Watters, the \nguideline ranges are\u2014is or are?\nMS. DUSTIN: The most serious with respect to \nthe new law violation, it\u2019s up to five years, the statutory \npenalty. And if this Court considers the misdemeanor as a \ngrade C violation, it would be 8 to 14 months. The conduct \n[30]underlying it would be 51 to 63 months because Mr. \nWatters\u2014\n\nAppendix G\n185a\nTHE COURT: Excuse me for interrupting, but I have \nfound that\u2014I\u2019m finding the alleged underlying conduct not \nto whatever the reduced plea was in Common Pleas Court.\nMS. DUSTIN: And that would be 51 to 63 months.\nTHE COURT: If I can make it clear for the record, \nI believe I am absolutely entitled to look at what really \nhappened rather than a disposition in another court. And \nif either of you want to make an objection to that, fine, \nfor purposes of preserving that on possible appeal. Mr. \nSchuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN: Object for purposes of preserving \nfor appeal.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Wagner?\nMR. WAGNER: We have no objection, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Okay.\nOkay, let\u2019s take Mr. Carrizales first as to him. \nGovernment\u2019s position? And then I will hear from Mr. \nWagner and Mr. Carrizales.\nMS. STERLING: Thank you, Your Honor. It\u2019s my \nunderstanding in speaking with the probation officer, \nspecifically Probation Officer Cordova who supervises \nMr. Carrizales who\u2019s not able to be present here today, \n[31]that he is recommending revocation and a guideline \nsentence of 60-months imprisonment. And we concur \n\nAppendix G\n186a\nwith that recommendation, not just for the conduct, but \nI think it\u2019s important that the record reflect the pattern \nof behavior here.\nMr. Carrizales was convicted in this court back in \n2011 with participating in a drug conspiracy, as well as \ndistributing cocaine. He was sentenced to a ten-year \nterm of imprisonment, which he served and began his \neight-year term of supervised release in May of 2018. \nWithin four months, Your Honor, he was arrested on \nanother felony charge, albeit an offense of violence that is \ninvolving a felony domestic violence and felonious assault. \nHe ultimately proceeded to trial, was convicted of a lesser \noffense, although still a felony of the third degree, and \nwas sentenced to three years imprisonment with The \nState of Ohio. He ended that prison term in November of \n2021. A violation report was filed with this Court, and he \nappeared in front of you on those violations, I believe, on \nNovember 8th of 2021. He was advised of the violation and \nthe potential penalties, and the matter was deferred for \napproximately a month. At that time he tested positive for \nmarijuana, was referred to the Zepf Center for counseling, \nand, again, the case was continued for approximately\u2014\nTHE COURT: And he had been released at the time?\n[32]MS. STERLING: Correct. At that time, of course, \nin January, specifically January 14th, of 2022, after all of \nthat, committed the new law violation involving the almost \nkilogram of marijuana, during which he was arrested with \nMr. Watters and his brother Tommy Watters, again, as \na reminder, those being co-defendants in his underlying \n\nAppendix G\n187a\ncase. And he subsequently entered a no contest plea and \nwas convicted to trafficking in that amount.\nSimply, Your Honor, he has completely and in every \nway possible ignored and disregarded the orders of this \nCourt and those of the probation department officer who \nhas tried to assist him. We believe at this time he should \nbe revoked and returned to the institution for 60 months.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Mr. Wagner, on behalf of your \nclient? Of course you may remain seated by all means.\nMR. WAGNER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: If you\u2019ll just pull the microphone about \nthis close to you so everyone can hear you.\nMR. WAGNER: Is this fine with The Court? Can The \nCourt hear me now?\nTHE COURT: Can you get the microphone a little \ncloser?\nMR. WAGNER: Testing one, two, three.\nTHE COURT: That\u2019s fine.\n[33]MR. WAGNER: Judge, I\u2019m sure doesn\u2019t come as \nany surprise to The Court that we take exception to the \nintent of the defendant. I will have him speak relative to \nmitigation, but I think it\u2019s important to note that when he \nwas arrested on December 10th of 2018, this was a dispute \n\nAppendix G\n188a\nwith respect to a girlfriend. He did tender a plea of not \nguilty. It was tried by The Judge\u2014by the jury, excuse me. \nAnd the results were a finding of not guilty of the charge, \nbut guilty of the lesser-included offense. He was given\u2014\nTHE COURT: I apologize, what\u2014so what\u2014of what \nwas he convicted?\nMR. WAGNER: Attempted felonious assault\u2014\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMR. WAGNER:\u2014resulting from a dispute and a\u2014and \na\u2014dispute. In that regard, Your Honor\u2014\nTHE COURT: Would that finding by the jury \nindicate\u2014I just want to know\u2014I assume that the \nattempted felonious assault means that the jury could \nnot find beyond a reasonable doubt that there had been \ncontact between him and the victim\u2014\nMR. WAGNER: Without\u2014\nTHE COURT:\u2014if you know?\nMR. WAGNER: Without retrying the case or \nlooking\u2014\n[34]THE COURT: I just want to know as a matter of \nlaw in Ohio, and if you don\u2019t know that\u2019s fine.\nMR. WAGNER: Well, my general sense impression, \nYour Honor, is an attempted assault is not a completion \n\nAppendix G\n189a\nof the assault.\nTHE COURT: Right. And, Ms. Sterling, you\u2019re a \nformer state prosecutor, I\u2019ll take judicial notice of that, do \nyou know? I mean, it\u2019s my understanding that an attempt \nmeans that you were unsuccessful in completing whatever \nattempt was\u2014whatever the intent\u2014the attempt was.\nMS. STERLING: I think that\u2019s accurate. Although, \nI want to clarify, I don\u2019t know that we could sit here and \npresume that the jury found that there was no contact with \nthe victim. It could also be that the finding was related to \nthe nature of the harm because a felonious assault in The \nState of Ohio requires a result of serious physical harm. \nThey could have found, for example, that he intended to \ncause her serious physical harm, but it only resulted in \nphysical harm, so I wouldn\u2019t want us to impose upon the \njury\u2019s finding.\nMR. WAGNER: If I might, Your Honor?\nTHE COURT: Absolutely.\nMR. WAGNER: We\u2019re talking about inferring the \nintent of the defendant. I think that the\u2014not only the \nfinding of the jury, but the imposition of the sentence [35]\nspeaks to the issue of it was not a completed felonious \nassault.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMR. WAGNER: Although we\u2019re not certainly here \n\nAppendix G\n190a\nto try the entire question of fact, and I appreciate that.\nTHE COURT: Okay. For purposes of this proceeding, \nhowever\u2014I will assume, without finding one way or the \nother, somehow\u2014know that there was no physical contact \nbetween your client and the victim.\nMR. WAGNER: Was?\nTHE COURT: That there was not?\nMR. WAGNER: Yes, Your Honor.\nRelative to the disposition\u2014disposition of The Court, \nthis case was subject to supervised release on November \n3rd of 2021, and there have been no further\u2014there\u2019s been \nno further activity with respect to the defendant and that \nindividual. And I would submit that this was an isolated \ncase with respect to two people who were very close at \none time. It was not a\u2014\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m setting that to one side entirely.\nMR. WAGNER: Please?\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m focused much more on the\u2014on \nthe\u2014the possession of the substantial quantity of illegal \ndrugs while in the company of others\u2014\n[36]MR. WAGNER: I appreciate, Your Honor\u2014\nTHE COURT:\u2014with whom he should not have been\u2014\n\nAppendix G\n191a\nin whose company he should not have been.\nMR. WAGNER: If The Court would want to hear \nanything with respect to the second violation, the driving \nwhile intoxicated, that was amended to a physical control. \nThere was an issue as to how it had been administered to \nthe defendant as to whether he was aware at the time that \nhe had consumed any alcohol, and the Municipal Court \ngave time served, which shows, once again, this is not a \ncontinuous course of conduct.\nTHE COURT: Let me ask the officer because I can\u2019t \nrecall, Officer Hagins, was there a no-alcohol condition?\nPROBATION: He does not have one, Your Honor.\nMR. WAGNER: But to buttress the argument, Your \nHonor, the lowering of the charge was based on the dispute \nas to whether or not defendant had been aware of the \nconsumption of alcohol as opposed to having been given a \ndrink without his knowledge of the alcohol content, which \nwas the basis of the lowering of the charge.\nI believe the only remaining case in which\u2014and I\u2019m \nsure The Court is concerned, is the contact with the known \nfelon, i.e., the co-defendant. Albeit that, in that regard, \nas The Court has been advised, the Common Pleas [37]\nCourt of Lucas County just accepted a plea of no contest \nto the misdemeanor\u2014amended misdemeanor count and \ngave the defendant time served. He was in custody as a \nresult of the holder from this Court. So the time served \n\nAppendix G\n192a\nwas\u2014was reflected.\nBeyond that, Your Honor, we have no further \nstatements.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Carrizales, you have the right to \nspeak on your own behalf before I decide what I\u2019m going \nto do by way of disposition.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And please get the microphone real \nclose.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Perfect.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I want to come to The Court \nand tell you when I got released from federal custody, \nI came from the RDAP program. When I went to the \nhalfway house, I really wasn\u2019t using the tools that they \nprovided for me during that program. At the same time, \nmy mother was in Hospice, and she was passing away, so \nit really took a toll on me. She\u2014going to her funeral and \nlooking at the memory, pictures, and seeing her grow with \nmy kids, and her grandkids, and my sisters and brothers, \nI wasn\u2019t in none of them because I had missed the majority \nof their lives.\n[38]As a young\u2014as a young child, I was in a gang. \nI was affiliated with a gang and so forth. It was just my \n\nAppendix G\n193a\nupbringing. It was not a household. You know, I\u2014I took \nto the streets of Toledo, Ohio. And my record shows that \nI\u2019m\u2014I look like a menace, I look terrible. I look horrible. \nAnd the day of question, right after that I started \ndrinking, of being released. On my own I went to the Zepf \nCenter, the 30 day in-house patient because I ended up \nin the hospital for the OVI. I don\u2019t know what occurred. \nI believe somebody slipped me a Mickey or something \nbecause I don\u2019t recall nothing. I just recall waking up in \nthe hospital bed with an IV in me looking at the side and \nlooking at an OVI picture and police report saying that I \ntotaled the car I was in.\nAnd from there I started, you know, really thinking \nabout myself and my children because they missed so \nmuch out of me. I got five children that they don\u2019t know \nme. They don\u2019t\u2014they know I\u2019m their dad, but they don\u2019t \nknow me because I was always incarcerated. I was always \ndoing the wrong thing. And I got out\u2014I got out of the\u2014I \ngot out of the hospital, went to rehab, and still lost. I was \nstill\u2014I was still lost.\nAnd the assault, felonious assault, at the time\u2014at \nthe time I don\u2019t know what occurred. It happened on \nThanksgiving. It happened on Thanksgiving. I [39]asked \nher not to drink, but my fiancee at the time wanted \nto drink or whatever. I woke up, I did not know what \nhappened. And\u2014and when I went to trial, that was my \nwhole defense is I didn\u2019t know what happened. But I know \nI didn\u2019t\u2014I wouldn\u2019t beat her. My mom didn\u2019t raise me like \nthat. I wouldn\u2019t do that. And when I got arrested right \nnow, and when you told me\u2014when I came to the street \n\nAppendix G\n194a\nand you said you\u2019re a woman beater and all that, that \nhurted me, that really hurted me. You really hurted me. \nThat hurt\u2014that killed me. I wanted to take my life that \nday, you know, as, like, damn, is this\u2014is this really me, \nlike\u2014and it\u2019s sad, it\u2019s really sad. But like I told The Judge \nwhen I got convicted of the attempted felonious assault, I \nasked to be sentenced right then and there. I could have \nfought the appeal, but Covid came and I was already in \nprison. And going to prison, I know what it was.\nSo they put me in prison, right. They put me in prison, \nin state prison where there\u2019s more drugs in the prison than \nout here on the streets. There\u2019s more chaos in\u2014in\u2014it\u2019s, \nlike, the streets, it\u2019s like the streets with no family. It\u2019s \nno help. It\u2019s not help. It\u2019s hard out here. It\u2019s easy in there \ndoing the\u2014doing your days, you know, getting fed, you \nknow, there\u2019s no bills, there\u2019s no responsibilities. There\u2019s \nnothing\u2014there\u2019s nothing [40]that is occurring, you know, \nand it\u2019s hard out here.\nAnd I\u2014and I\u2014I don\u2019t want to\u2014I want to say I\u2014I \napologize for even coming to this point in my life. I\u2019m \ntired of the walls, I\u2019m tired of being locked up. I want to \nbe a law abiding citizen, sir, and abide by the\u2014by these \npapers, by my actions, though, that I never showed that. I \nnever\u2014I showed nothing but ignorance, and it hurts. And \nmy kids look at that, and I got five of them, and they\u2019re \ngrowing\u2014almost grown adults that I never had no part, \na dead beat father. I can change that, sir. I can be the \nspokesperson that people to be looking through my eyes, \nlook at what it is. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard. I know it\u2019s hard on \npeople going on day-to-day and doing their jobs and stuff \n\nAppendix G\n195a\nproviding for their family. It\u2019s easy in jail, but there\u2019s no \nhelp. In every\u2014in every institution you go to, there\u2019s\u2014the \nratio of correctional officers is crazy. I know I can be a \nproductive citizen if you allow me to. And I am so sorry, \nand if I ever\u2014if you give me a chance, and if I ever come \nbefore you again, I will let you give me life in prison. I \nwould deserve life in prison if I ever come back to you and \nyou see my face again because I don\u2019t deserve it.\nAnd for me coming out in 2021, yes, I was doing \ndrugs in prison. That\u2019s why I came out dirty. That\u2019s why \n[41]I came out dirty. But if they looked at my counts, my \nurine counts because I did nothing wrong, except I did \nsomething wrong. My aunt passed away, I was helping my \ncousin, and there was some substance in the car. And I \ntold you that day in court, like, I did not\u2014I did not know. \nI wouldn\u2019t have put myself in that predicament to lose my \nkids again, to see the pain in their face of me going again. \nI never had a life. I don\u2019t have a life. I\u2019m not asking you \nto just let me free. I can do steps. I can\u2014if you put me \nin a halfway house for a year or so or do something\u2014and \nI apologize. I just say I apologize from the bottom of my \nheart. I know on those papers and when people look at me, \nand when people Google me and all this, it\u2019s terrible, Your \nHonor. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s terrible. I want\u2014I\u2019m asking The \nCourt, and I\u2019m asking you for mercy, mercy, and mercy, \nYour Honor.\nTHE COURT: You can be seated, whichever makes \nyou more comfortable. I do have a question because I \nsimply don\u2019t know. At the time you were arrested, were \n\nAppendix G\n196a\nyou working?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, Your Honor. \nI was working at the Huntington Center downtown. \nThe money that they seized, the $388, is a check that I \njust\u2014just cashed. The check stub\u2019s in my wallet that the \ngovernment\u2019s going to get to me once I\u2014\n[42]THE COURT: What were you doing at night with \ntwo people you knew were felons? You knew you shouldn\u2019t \nhave been with them. You\u2019ve admitted to the misdemeanor, \nthe possession of a substantial quantity of marijuana?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Your Honor, it was \njust, like, I wanted to say, like, I gave up. I wanted to go \nto trial. I told my lawyer I did want to go to trial. I did \nwant to go to trial because it took\u2014it took a lot out of\u2014I \nhad\u2014I had to admit to something that\u2014\nTHE COURT: Well, candidly, you can tell me you \ndidn\u2019t know it was in that garbage bag and try to convince \nme, but I\u2019ll tell you right now that would be kind of hard \nto believe that you wouldn\u2019t have gotten in the car and \nasked Tommy what is that, or, Timmy, what is that stuff \nin there. And even if you had no other connection with it, \nyou were in possession of it because it\u2019s right next to you\u2014\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir, and that\u2019s \nwhy\u2014\nTHE COURT:\u2014and that constitutes possession. I \n\nAppendix G\n197a\ndon\u2019t have my glasses in my hand. They\u2019re over there a few \nfeet from me. I don\u2019t have possession of my coat upstairs. \nI don\u2019t have it on, or my briefcase, but I have possession \nof it as a matter of law.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, Your Honor.\n[43]THE COURT: And I\u2019m sorry, sir, but you knew \nyour circumstances, you knew the conditions. I don\u2019t know \nif you\u2019ve ever heard about me and violations of supervised \nrelease, but I take them very seriously. You previously \nhad a conviction for being in physical control of a vehicle \nwhile intoxicated. And I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019m letting you \nknow what is of concern to me.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: I understand.\nTHE COURT: And I\u2019ll let you know, I am setting \naside whatever the encounter was with the young woman. \nI\u2019m sure Mr. Wagner has told you, that\u2019s the one thing \nnobody on supervised release wants to do in front of Judge \nCarr because he asks\u2014establish domestic violence, if any \nman on supervised release has touched any woman with \nanything but affection, my question is how high can I go. \nIt\u2019s not the Toledo Municipal Court, or Perrysburg, or \nwhatever. I want to assure you, that didn\u2019t occur, okay.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: There\u2019s no evidence and reason for me \nto believe\u2014I\u2019m about to do anything to anybody when \nit comes time to sentence them with (indicating), I just \n\nAppendix G\n198a\nwant to assure you of that. That\u2019s why I run through \nthat discussion I did earlier. So what I\u2019m focused on the \npossession after your prior conviction, serious convictions. \nYou\u2019re in the company of somebody, and I\u2019ll [44]get to \nthis shortly, who not only has been convicted, but has \npreviously been revoked by me for noncompliance with the \nsimple requests of the probation officer basically coming \nin here with a cockamamie story about this, that, and \nthe other thing. You\u2019re in his company\u2014I cannot recall, \nI don\u2019t think Mr. Tommy Watters has been before me \non a violation, but Mr. Timmy Watters has. I don\u2019t know \nwhether you knew that at the time.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: No, Your Honor, I \nhaven\u2019t.\nTHE COURT: Okay. But you\u2019re in the car, a substantial \nquantity of marijuana, I\u2019m going to find that you knew, or \nhad reason to know that that was contraband, that you \nhad no business being in possession of it and you were. \nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing on.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Particularly in light of your prior \nfederal conviction in this court. I\u2019ll be very candid with \nyou, very honest, you know what, you should have been \nhome that night with your kids.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: You\u2019re absolutely \nright, sir.\n\nAppendix G\n199a\nTHE COURT: And that\u2019s\u2014I can\u2019t recall because I did \nnot look, though I usually do, but in this instance I looked \nthe Presentence Reports. That\u2019s my custom and practice. \nSo I don\u2019t recall how many children you have, or [45]the \nages or whatever, but I get it, old guy telling you this, but \nyou want to stay away from me, and Ms. Sterling, and Ms. \nDustin, and the police officers, get a job. You had a job. \nGo to the job, do the job, go home, close the door, and Mr. \nTimmy Watters, Mr. Tommy Watters, comes knocking at \nyour door, don\u2019t open it.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Very simple moralistic, simplistic \nlecture. That\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s the way you avoid being where \nyou are.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: You\u2019re absolutely \nright, sir.\nTHE COURT: And I assume your kids are all pretty \nwell grown, teenagers or whatever?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: And you\u2019re right, you missed\u2014candidly \nyou missed the majority of your life with them. \nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: The older they get, kids grow and go. \nThe older they are, the less chance you have to form that \nrelationship with them.\n\nAppendix G\n200a\nEnough with the lecture. Mr. Watters (sic), I want you \nto know that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned about. By all means, you \nmay continue if you desire. I did not mean to cut you off.\n[46]MR. WAGNER: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Pardon me?\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, I think his recitation is \ncompleted on behalf of Mr. Carrizales.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Carrizales, I\u2019m sorry.\nMR. WAGNER: I think we presented our case. \nTHE COURT: If you\u2019ll move the microphone a little \ncloser.\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, we\u2019ve completed our \npresentation.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Pursuant to the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984\u2014anything further on behalf of the \ngovernment?\nMS. STERLING: No, Your Honor, but I do want to \nremind The Court that in the violation report that Mr. \nCordova filed, he indicated that he did not know where Mr. \nCarrizales had been residing, that, to his knowledge, he \nwas unemployed. And although he had connected him with \nthe Zepf Center, when he spoke to the counselor there, she \nsaid that when Mr. Carrizales shows up, he\u2019s polite and \n\nAppendix G\n201a\ncourteous, however, he misses more appointments than \nhe actually shows up for.\nTHE COURT: Thank you for reminding me of that. In \nthis instance, Mr. Carrizales, those other circumstances \nwould be, in this instance, ultimately what I am responding \n[47]to is being in the presence of two convicted felons, \nthemselves, I believe, former drug dealers, and with \na substantial quantity of marijuana. I\u2019m sure you\u2014\nmarijuana, wasn\u2019t Fentanyl, Judge, that\u2019s okay, but, still, \nwhen you\u2019re subject to conditions of supervised release, \nthere is nothing that\u2019s optional because every one of those \nconditions is a court order. It\u2019s not something that the \nprobation officer makes up and wants you to do or would \nlike to see you do, which I do too, but when it comes to me, \nthere are no options. And I believe, quite candidly, in light \nof the evidence in front of me, you guys were out there \nbroad, in the nighttime, headed somewhere to distribute \nthose drugs. I see nothing in this record to conclude to the \ncontrary. That may not have been what you were about, \nbut, based upon the totality of the evidence, I think, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, it\u2019s fair for me to conclude \nthat. And that is conduct that cannot, should not, and will \nnot be tolerated.\nSo pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and \n18 U.S. Code Section 3553(a), judgment of this Court the \ndefendant be and hereby committed to the custody of the \nBureau of Prisons to serve a term of 60 months. That will \nbe followed by a six-year term of supervised release. Put \nyou back on supervised release because I want this Court, \nwhether it be I or another Judge, to have the ability and \n\nAppendix G\n202a\n[48]opportunity to do two things; to see to it that you have \nthe opportunity to succeed, and to show this Court and \nthe community that you can comply with the law. And I \nexpect you to work with the officer and to be honest with \nthe officer.\nAll of the previous conditions of supervised release \nwill be imposed. And you\u2019ll also be prohibited from the \nuse of alcohol.\nYou\u2019ll also be required to diligently seek, and if you \nobtain, diligently to maintain lawful, gainful employment. \nYou should cooperate with the probation officer with \nregard to any efforts that the officer makes on your behalf \nin that regard.\nIn addition to all the other conditions of supervised \nrelease, within 72 hours of your release from your custody \nof the Bureau of Prisons, you shall report in person to \nthe pretrial service and probation office in this district to \nbegin serving that term of supervised release.\nAnd let me ask the officer, is there anything further \nthat I should include by way of special conditions of \nsupervised release?\nPROBATION: Your Honor, I just wanted to make The \nCourt aware that he already had a no alcohol condition.\nTHE COURT: That\u2019s what I thought. It\u2019s unclear in \nmy colloquy whether that was so, but I want that.\n\nAppendix G\n203a\n[49]Mr. Carrizales, let me give you a bit of advice. \nI\u2019ve already said what I\u2019ve said. When you come out, \nget a job. Some years ago I tried to meet the folks \ncoming out of federal custody coming home. And I say as \nemphatically as I can, get a job. There are times when it\u2019s \nvery difficult, but\u2014and I hope that this remains, people \nthat have been convicted with the offenses that you\u2019ve \nbeen convicted of with the kind of record that you have \ncan get jobs. Employers are begging for people to go to \nwork that want to go to work. I remember vividly there \nwas a gentleman sitting in the corner there in the jury \nbox, and I was making the same speech to that group. \nThis gentleman raised his hand, he was talking to me, but \nhe was speaking to the people in the jury box. He said, \nJudge, I just got out of federal prison after 27 years, and \nI have a job. I seldom recall who he was, he was one of the \nWalton brothers. I don\u2019t know, Pete, if you know who\u2014or \nthe Warner brothers, back in the day when the guidelines \nwere mandatory and I handled all pretrial matters. He \ncan get a job, I hope you can get a job. I hope you listen \nto this old guy when he tells you get a job. Get up in time \nto get to the job, do the job, go home. Whether you\u2019ve got \na girlfriend, a spouse, somebody whose record is entirely \nclean, or hopefully your own adult kids, and maybe even \ngrandchildren. Be with them, to the extent that you can, \n[50]try to establish a relationship and be the kind of dad, \nand maybe, God willing, a grandfather that you\u2019d like to \nbe. That way we\u2019ll never see each other again.\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\n\nAppendix G\n204a\nTHE COURT: We\u2019ll never see each other. And if \ndrinking\u2019s a problem, temptation, talk to the officer. Tell \nhim. Try A.A. People\u2014I\u2019ve known several in it, they say \nit works somehow. I don\u2019t know.\nAnd finally, be honest with your officer because if the \nofficer can\u2019t trust you, ultimately I can\u2019t trust you. That\u2019s \nwhat this is all about.\nThe 3553(a) factors, I\u2019ve considered the history \nand char\u2014personal characteristic of this defendant, \nprincipally his prior criminal record. It\u2019s quite clearly\u2014\nthat evening intending to distribute marijuana. Sure it \nwas not cocaine, sure it\u2019s not Fentanyl, sure it\u2019s not heroin, \nbut, nonetheless, is a Controlled Substance that\u2019s against \nthe law to distribute.\nUltimately what I\u2019m trying to accomplish is not only \nyour rehabilitation so that you understand that if you want \nto avoid going to prison forever increasing lengths of time, \nyou\u2019ve got to stop violating the law. My purpose is to see to \nit that that happens, your interest, your family\u2019s interest, \nand ultimately the community\u2019s interest.\nI do think that an objective observer would say [51]that \nthe sentence is just, and it\u2019s not greater than necessary \nto accomplish its purposes, as Mr. Carrizales indicated \npersonal rehabilitation, and protection of the community.\nMs. Dustin, Ms. Sterling, is there anything you want \nme to stay about the 3553(a) factors?\n\nAppendix G\n205a\nMS. STERLING: Perhaps. Your Honor, I assume your \nsentence also includes, although you listed your primary \nconcerns, also includes awareness or concerns for general \ndeterrence, particularly given Mr. Carrizales\u2019\u2014\nTHE COURT: And individual deterrence, absolutely. \nThank you very much. That\u2019s kind of always the case, but \nalso want to let others know, Mr. Carrizales, when you\u2019re \non supervised release in a Federal Court, there\u2019s no free \npass. Sure, minor violation, we\u2019ll work with you. Something \nmajor exists, no. If you haven\u2019t learned from your prior \ncriminal convictions that you\u2019ve got to follow the law, and \nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to emphasize and make clear to \nyou, you\u2019ve got to follow the law.\nAnything further in that regard, Ms. Sterling? Thank \nyou very much.\nMS. STERLING: No, thank you.\nMR. WAGNER: Your Honor, I apologize.\nTHE COURT: Of course.\n[52]MR. WAGNER: Could The Court advise as to the \nimmediate incarceration sentence?\nTHE COURT: Pardon? Place of incarceration? \nMR. WAGNER: Yeah\u2014no, no, the amount of time \nimmediately.\n\nAppendix G\n206a\nTHE COURT: 60. I will recommend, I don\u2019t know if \nyou qualify, Mr. Carrizales, but I certainly will recommend \nthat the BOP keep you and place you in a facility as close \nto Toledo as possible so that whatever bonding connection \nyou may be able to form or formulate with your family, it \nwill be easier for them to do so. I have no control over that. \nI don\u2019t know whether, given your criminal history, you \nqualify for that. I don\u2019t know\u2014that would be emphasized \nin the judgment entry.\nYou do have a right to an appeal. Talk that over with \nMr. Wagner whether there are grounds for you to appeal \nwhat I\u2019ve done today by the way of finding the violations \nand also the sentence that I\u2019ve imposed. If grounds to \nappeal appear to exist, have Mr. Wagner file a notice of \nappeal on your behalf within 14 days, or you will lose \nyour right you might otherwise have to challenge your \ndisposition and sanctions that I\u2019ve imposed today. And \nthat\u2014and then if Mr. Wagner represents you, or if you or \nhe would prefer, you can have another attorney appointed \neither by me or The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The \n[53]most important thing is you must file a notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days, or you lose forever whatever opportunity \nyou might otherwise have to challenge your adjudication \nand disposition. Do you understand that?\nDEFENDANT CARRIZALES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Okay. All of that will be without cost \nto yourself, including preparation of the record of these \nproceedings.\n\nAppendix G\n207a\nDoes either party have any objection to any part of \nthese proceedings not previously made?\nMS. STERLING: Not on behalf of the government. \nMR. WAGNER: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: That will conclude this proceeding.\nNow on behalf of Mr. Watters. Ms. Dustin?\nMS. DUSTIN: Yes, Your Honor, I just wanted to touch \nbriefly on how we got here today, to remind The Court \nMr. Watters was convicted of drug conspiracy in 2015 and \nwas sentenced to 120 months. He served his sentence, and \nwhen he was released on supervised release, in August \nof 2019, he was ultimately violated. And those terms that \nhe was violated on, he was found to have drug\u2014drug use \nand failed to truthfully answer questions by his probation \nofficer.\nAnd I wanted to remind The Court of the hearings we \nhad with Probation Officer Dawn Robinson at the time. \n[54]And\u2014\nTHE COURT: Excuse me, Ms. Dustin, I remember \nthem vividly. I remember the problem, the extent to which \nshe had to go\u2014because he simply was not forthcoming \non his financial situation and circumstances. I think I\u2019m \ncorrect about that.\nMS. DUSTIN: Yes, you\u2019re right. In fact\u2014\n\nAppendix G\n208a\nTHE COURT: She went above and beyond.\nMS. DUSTIN: In fact, he also was\u2014he also failed \nto disclose expenditures over $500, and ultimately you \nimposed a sanction\u2014you revoked his supervision, imposed \n14-month imprisonment.\nTHE COURT: And reinstated his term of supervised \nrelease.\nMS. DUSTIN: And you did, Your Honor. And now we \nare here again on another violation of supervised release, \nand ultimately the defendant sits before you today on \nthese violations. And if The Court would recall, we had \na preliminary hearing in this case to establish probable \ncause for the violation, and that occurred on February \n15th, 2022. I think it\u2019s relevant because earlier, during his \nallocution, Mr. Carrizales referred to being with his cousin, \nand his cousin was moving and his aunt had died, and he \nwas helping his cousin move. And they were\u2014and kind \nof insinuating the marijuana was in [55]the car because \nI believe when he said he was helping his cousin move \nhe was referring to Mr. Timothy Watters. I was looking \nback at the transcript of the probable cause hearing, and \nMarjorie Rosales testified, and, on cross-examination, I \nbelieve that is Mr. Watters\u2019 wife or girlfriend, on cross-\nexamination she was asked if she remembered the day he \nwas arrested, and she said, yes, it was January 14th. And \nI asked, do you know or recall whether or not he worked \nthat day, and she indicated that he was off because the \naunt had died and the whole family needed to be in the \nhospital. And I asked if he was off on January 14th, and \n\nAppendix G\n209a\nshe said yes. And I said, would you tell us how long had \nyou lived at the address on Lewis. When did you move to \nLewis? And she responded the same day when we\u2014when \nhe was pulled over that day moving stuff to the house, and \nI was supposed to stay that night in the house. And I asked, \nyou were moving to the Lewis address on January 14th, \n2022. And she said, yes, ma\u2019am. And I asked where did \nyou move from, and she said the residence at Point Place.\nSo my point is, he pretty much corroborates that the \naunt died, he was helping Mr. Watters move, Mr. Watters \nwas driving the car, and in the car was almost a kilo of \nmarijuana. And back at the previous house, the house they \nwere moving from, as you saw in the photographs today, \n[56]there was what can be used as a press for cocaine \nwhich NIK tested positive. Those are serious violations. \nAnd, as this Court noted at the time of the prior hearing, \nyou know, when he was found guilty of the prior violations, \nthat\u2019s\u2014that was serious conduct. Apparently Mr. Watters \ndoesn\u2019t learn, and he is not deterred by this Court.\nI also came across a Toledo Blade article that \nreferenced Mr. Watters. And I thought I would bring this \nto this Court\u2019s attention.\nTHE COURT: Have you shown that to Mr. Schuman? \nWhy don\u2019t you take a moment to do so please. And if you \nwant, you can mark it as an exhibit if you wish to offer it, \nwhatever you and Mr. Schuman have to say.\nMr. Schuman, any objection?\n\nAppendix G\n210a\nMR. SCHUMAN: Judge, having just seen it, I guess \nI would object for the record.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nMS. DUSTIN: This appeared in the Toledo Blade on \nDecember 21st, 2022. If you don\u2019t need to hear it, I will \nnot reference it.\nTHE COURT: Apparently Mr. Schuman did not have a \nchance to see it beforehand. No problem. It\u2019s fairly recent, \nbut that\u2019s okay. Go ahead.\nMS. DUSTIN: Your Honor, this sentence that you \nimpose today should reflect the serious nature of the \n[57]offense, the fact that the defendant was previously \nconvicted of a drug conspiracy, he was on supervised \nrelease, and he\u2014and he was in a car with other felons \nwith a large amount of marijuana and what appears to be \na cocaine press at his previous residence. Your sentence \nshould reflect the history and characteristics of this \ndefendant, who seems to not be able to follow the law or \nthis Court\u2019s orders. And your sentence should deter him \nbecause nothing seems to deter him, and deter others from \nsimilar conduct. We ask you to impose a sentence\u2014the \nlast time you imposed a sentence of 14 months, and that \ndid not deter him. And we ask that you impose a sentence \ncloser to the statutory maximum in this case in order to \ndeter him and others.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Schuman, Mr. Watters, you have \nthe right to speak. Mr. Schuman?\n\nAppendix G\n211a\nMR. SCHUMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. Your \nHonor, when I was a state court prosecutor I tried to find \nsomething positive to say about defendants at sentencing, \nat least that\u2019s my memory. Naturally, and hopefully, I \ncontinue to do that in my role as a defense lawyer. I can \nsay that Mr. Watters has worked, he has a work history, \nI find him to be very intelligent. He\u2019s had 13 months to \nreflect on his conduct in this case. He\u2019s an intelligent \nperson. He has the capability of making a contribution to \n[58]society. He has finished cognitive behavioral therapy. \nHe was enrolled in counseling at the Zepf Center at the \ntime of his arrest. He was employed at C & J Complete \nAuto. He resides with his wife, I believe, at 6015 Lewis \nhere in Toledo. She\u2019s present here in the courtroom today. \nWe have a slight difference of opinion, I realize, Your \nHonor. I would encourage The Court to treat this as a \nclass C violation that does not require revocation, impose \na 14-month sentence, or 13-month sentence, give my client \ncredit for time served and continue him on supervised \nrelease.\nA few more comments, if I may, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT: Sure. Of course.\nMR. SCHUMAN: My client took responsibility for \nthe drug charges both here and in State Court. He took \nresponsibility for the press. He took responsibility for the \ncharge of associating with felons. He could have taken it \nto hearing. As I said, he took responsibility. He realizes \nhe made mistakes. He\u2019s been sitting for 13 months in \ncustody on this charge thinking about that. My client \n\nAppendix G\n212a\nindicates that he filed reports indicating he had contact \nwith felons, namely his brother, Timothy Watters (sic), and \nMr. Carrizales, who I understand to be a cousin related \nby marriage. He said his supervisors never had an issue \nwith this.\n[59]I find The Court\u2019s point interesting against his \nbrother, maybe they live together, I don\u2019t know, Your \nHonor. I\u2019m not arguing with you, Judge, that there were \ndrugs in the car. That\u2019s not a legitimate purpose to be \nhanging around your brother, but\u2014\nTHE COURT: Or your cousin.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Or your cousin. However, it was \nconduct on multiple occasions, most of the rest of that time \nthat he had conduct with these people, I don\u2019t know that \nthere was criminal behavior.\nTHE COURT: That doesn\u2019t bother me at all. That\u2019s \nsomething\u2014if the officer was aware of it, fine. Again, \nthe fact that you have family members who are\u2014I don\u2019t \nthink\u2014the no-contact requirement is intended to make \nsure that the kind of contact and conduct that occurred \nwhen they were together when they were stopped doesn\u2019t \noccur. So that\u2019s why\u2014that\u2019s the aspect, or the situation, \nthat I consider to violate that prohibition. What happened \nwas had he paid attention to that prohibition, we wouldn\u2019t \nbe here today. But he didn\u2019t, and it was a serious violation. \nOthers, no. That\u2019s why I tried to allude to earlier, kind of \nan odd thing you can\u2019t have contact with your brother or \ncousin or whatever. I mean, that\u2019s not the kind of contact \n\nAppendix G\n213a\nwe\u2019re talking about, and that\u2019s not the kind of contact that \nwas going on that [60]night.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Understood.\nTHE COURT: They were abroad with a lot of \nmarijuana, and I believe, and I think that the record \nprovides me with an ample basis for doing so, at least by \na preponderance of the evidence, which is the standard \nhere, that they weren\u2019t going to find a pipe and smoke it on \ntheir own, going to roll it in a cigarette or whatever they \ndo. They were going to distribute it, and they were going \nto make money distributing. Society increasingly shrugs \ntheir shoulders about marijuana, but I can\u2019t and don\u2019t. It\u2019s \na violation of the conditions of supervised release, and a \nserious one. But go ahead, I just want you to understand \nthe context. Go ahead.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. I \nunderstand. One moment, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Of course. Absolutely.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Your Honor, thank you. I will rest \non those comments.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Watters, you have a right to speak \non your own behalf before I decide what I\u2019m going to do.\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor. I\u2019ll try \nto make this brief.\n\nAppendix G\n214a\nTHE COURT: You\u2019re welcome to speak as long as [61]\nyou want. My time is your time.\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: You made it clear I tend \nto dig myself a bigger hole, so I\u2019ll just get to the point. \nNo excuses for anything that\u2019s gone on. Maybe an apology \nis in order, a couple of them, and one to Mr. Carrizales \nhere, an apology to him. And, secondly, an apology to my \nwife because I failed her as a husband by putting myself \nin this predicament again. I remember you saying that I \nwas incorrigible. I don\u2019t believe that to be true, but in this \ncircumstance it could obviously seem that way.\nAnd to address what Ms. Dustin was trying to bring \nto light about the article in The Blade, well, I was in a \nsituation there where\u2014\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know anything about it, Mr. \nWatters. You\u2019re welcome to tell me about it.\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: I\u2019ll keep it pretty brief. \nSometimes you get in relationships with people when \nyou\u2019re in jail more than you do with people on the outside.\nTHE COURT: Sure, you\u2019re with them more.\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yeah. A guy that I know \nin there\u2014a guy that I knew in there asked me if I knew a \nperson and said his kids were missing. And I said I will try \nto see if I can help him. I didn\u2019t call no police, I didn\u2019t call \nno\u2014Ms. Dustin. I didn\u2019t call nobody. I made a phone call \nto somebody I knew to see if there was a [62]way to bring \n\nAppendix G\n215a\nthem kids back home to their parents. Unfortunately I was \ntoo late. And, yes, it was put in The Blade, but it didn\u2019t \nhurt me at all, Your Honor, because I have no connection \nto the streets anymore. So, like I said, I put myself in a \nvery bad situation time and time again. It\u2019s not your fault, \nit\u2019s not Ms. Dustin\u2019s fault, nobody\u2019s fault but my own. I\u2019m \njust sorry that I\u2019m dragging down people that are close to \nme and people who I do\u2014I do care about and love, that I \naffect their lives as well. So as of\u2014since the beginning of \nall of this, I\u2019ve taken my own\u2014when I\u2019m in the wrong, I \ntake responsibility and I keep on moving. And with that, I \nagree with whatever you give me, Your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Schuman, anything further?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Anything further from the government? \nMS. DUSTIN: Nothing, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform \nAct of 1984 and 18 U.S. Code Section 3553(a), judgment \nof this Court that defendant be and hereby committed to \nthe custody of the Bureau of Prisons to serve a term of \n60 months.\nUpon completion of that term, you should report \nwithin 72 hours U.S. Pretrial and Probation Office in this \ndistrict or U.S. Probation Office in whatever district you \nare released.\n\nAppendix G\n216a\n[63]I will, likewise, strongly encourage the Bureau to \nlet you serve your time in Milan. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a \nthreat, or security issue, or anything else. To the extent \nthat their mechanistic computation might put you at a \nhigher security level, I would encourage them to look past \nthat and enable both of you to remain in contact with your \npeople here in Toledo.\nI\u2019m going to place you, likewise, on a period of six \nmore years of supervised release. I\u2019ll be very candid with \nyou, I\u2019m going to be very candid with both of you, I want \nthis Court to have that string. And if you can\u2019t abide by \neach term and condition of supervised release, you\u2019ll be \nright back in front of me or another Judge. And you\u2019ll \nwind up, yet again\u2014but you\u2019ve shown that basically, now \ntwice, the terms and conditions of supervised release are \noptional. And they are not optional. And I want to make \nsure, in terms of your own interest, and the interest of \nthe community, and to protect the community, and also \nanybody who knows what\u2019s happening here today gets it \nthat disregarding the terms and conditions of supervised \nrelease, particularly in the quantity\u2014if large quantity \nof Controlled Substance is involved, you\u2019re going to get \npunished. You\u2019re going to pay a severe consequence. I \nhope you understand that, Mr. Watters. You\u2019ve went \nthrough it, I remember it [64]vividly, I remember correctly \nOfficer Robinson was just trying to get some financial \ninformation, you were providing her with statements about \nyour employment and occupation and so forth. She wanted \nto know. And if I recall correctly, she had to go knocking \non doors of banks. It was an exhaustive time consuming \neffort on her part that should not\u2014she should not have \n\nAppendix G\n217a\nhad to take the time to get the information she did had \nyou been honest with her. You blew her off, you blew off \nthe conditions of supervised release about responding to \nthe request for financial information. And at least that \nnight when you\u2019re out there with your brother and Mr. \nCarrizales and the garbage bag with a lot of marijuana \nin it, upward of a kilo, once again, you were paying no \nattention to the terms and conditions of supervised \nrelease. And my lengthy term of continued supervised \nrelease is to try to see to it that, at long last, you get it, \nand also to serve\u2014not just try to see to it that you do, but \nthat you learn to comply with what The Court and the law \ntells you you have to do.\nAlso to make clear to the public generally that \nsomeone like yourself doesn\u2019t get it, then they\u2019re going \nto get prison time, and a lot of it. That\u2019s the purpose of \nmy sentence.\nYou will report to the pretrial service and probation \noffice. All of the previous terms and conditions [65]will \nbe reimposed.\nAnd Officer Hagins, is there anything else at this \ntime? There\u2019ll be the special condition about undertaking \nto obtain and maintain lawful gainful employment, and \nto cooperate with the probation officer and your officer\u2019s \nefforts in that regard.\nOnce again, you\u2019ll be required to provide, promptly \nand accurately, any requested financial information that \nthe probation officer may ask you to provide.\n\nAppendix G\n218a\nOfficer Hagins, any further special conditions you\u2019d \nlike me to impose or reimpose?\nPROBATION: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. I believe I expressed my\u2014the\u2014\nmy reasons for imposition of this sentence. They are to \nprotect the public. They are to encourage understanding \nof compliance of the terms and conditions, individual \ndeterrence, and public deterrence. In this Court there\u2019s \nno such thing as an optional condition of supervision, just \nas there\u2019s no optional condition when you\u2019re on pretrial \nrelease. They\u2019re court orders, and this is a consequence of \nnot obeying a court order. I told you before, Mr. Watters, \nyou\u2019re not in The State system anymore. We care, we pay \nattention, and we respond.\nI have considered your background, history and [66]\ncharacteristics, your prior criminal record with which I\u2019m \nobviously quite familiar. And I do think that somebody \nlooking at this with the overall circumstances would find \nthat this is both a just and deserved sanction, and would \nhope that it would enhance respect for the law.\nMs. Dustin, anything further you want me to say about \nthe 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN: Perhaps just addressing the deterrence \nfactor.\nTHE COURT: I can\u2019t quite hear you.\n\nAppendix G\n219a\nMS. DUSTIN: Perhaps address the deterrence factor, \nYour Honor.\nTHE COURT: I thought I had, both individual and \npublic deterrence. I hope others hear about this. When \nyou come to Federal Court, you\u2019re in the big leagues. \nWe play hard ball. There\u2019s no paddle ball here, okay, no \nshrug of the shoulders. We give you a chance at a break, \nyou don\u2019t take that chance, we move things up a notch. \nAnd you\u2019re really Exhibit A in that regard, Mr. Watters. \nI\u2019m sorry that you are, but I think it\u2019s necessary that you \nbe so that people understand they can\u2019t be out abroad in \nthe company of people you shouldn\u2019t be with doing things \nthat the law prohibits and expect\u2014if you get caught, we\u2019ll \nsimply reinstate the terms and conditions of supervised \nrelease and tell you to behave, tell you to do that, [67]\nbecause that\u2019s the bottom line when we get right down to it.\nI do believe that the sentence is sufficient but not \ngreater than necessary to get your attention, to see to it, \nI hope, that once you are out, you will, at long last, learn \nthat lesson. You\u2019ve got to do, no matter how much you don\u2019t \nwant to do it, you may desire to do something else, as long \nas you\u2019re on supervised release for this Court, you\u2019ve got \nto do what this Court, myself, and the probation officer \nsays. That\u2019s your only option. Because if you don\u2019t and \nyou come back, whoever sees you then, whether it\u2019s I or \nsomebody else, is going to look at this, and they\u2019re going \nto ask, just as I did, implicitly, how high is up, because \ngoing up as high as I can so that I believe it\u2019s necessary, \nparticularly in your circumstance, to make clear that \nyou\u2019ve got to do what the law and The Court requires. If \n\nAppendix G\n220a\nyou don\u2019t, this is what\u2019s going to happen to somebody else \nwho hears about it. They\u2019ve got a similar situation, I hope \nthey get the lesson that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to \nthem. Ultimately I\u2019m protecting the community.\nAnything further you want me to say, Ms. Dustin, \nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN: No, Your Honor. Thank you.\nTHE COURT: You have a right, as I\u2019ve indicated \n[68]to Mr. Carrizales, to appeal. Talk to Mr. Schuman, \nyour very capable lawyer, as that Mr. Wagner is, and if \ngrounds to appeal appear to exist, by all means within \n14 days file a notice of appeal. If you decide to have him \nand he desires to continue to represent you, he\u2019ll do so \nwithout cost to yourself. The record will be prepared \nwithout cost to yourself. And if either you or he wants \nyou to have another attorney, different attorney, we\u2019ll \nmake that request known to either me or to the Court of \nAppeals. Do you understand all that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Within 14 days, 14 days. It\u2019s a very \nshort timeframe. After that, you will lose\u2014if you haven\u2019t \nfiled a notice of appeal, you will lose any and all right you \nmight otherwise have to challenge what I\u2019ve done today, \neither by way of direct appeal, post-conviction relief, or \nhabeas corpus. Do you understand that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS: Yes, Your Honor.\n\nAppendix G\n221a\nTHE COURT: I want to repeat that to you too,\nMr. Carrizales; 14 days, otherwise you lose the \nopportunity to challenge whatever.\nDoes any party have any objection to any part of these \nproceedings not previously made?\nMR. WAGNER: No, Your Honor.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Your Honor, few remarks if I may. \n[69]I have a few requests if I may.\nTHE COURT: Sure.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMy client wishes to have the no contact order with Mr. \nCarrizales removed; credit for 13 months in custody on \nthis violation, which I think is appropriate. He requested \n14-months credit for the time served on the earlier \nviolation. He notes he had three years of supervised \nrelease previously.\nI object, for the record, to the sentence imposed for \npurpose of appeal.\nMy client also notes that his proper last name now \nis\u2014I hope I say it correctly, Jaimez J-A-I-M-E-Z. His \nname was legally changed in State Court in Ohio some \nyears ago.\n\nAppendix G\n222a\nTHE COURT: I think\u2014you know, I think that had \noccurred before, but it wasn\u2019t brought to my attention. I \nwill note that. Let me only say I\u2019m going to refrain from \nmaking any recommendation as to what the Bureau of \nPrisons should do in terms of his computation for time \nserved. That\u2019s entirely within the province of the Bureau \nof Prisons.\nCorrect, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. DUSTIN: Your Honor, I believe he would not get \ncredit because he was already serving time on The State \n[70]offense. I think he was being held with\u2014he already \ngot credit for that time. He did not have to serve the 180 \ndays because they gave him credit for the 180 days.\nTHE COURT: All I\u2019m saying\u2014I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s really \nout of my hands. I can sit and try to do a computation. I will \nsimply say that I expect that, both Mr. Carrizales and he, \nshall oversee what the Bureau of Prisons will be attentive \nand accurately calculate the time served credit as to the \nsentence that I\u2019ve imposed. Beyond that, I can\u2019t\u2014I have \nno authority to\u2014Ms. Sterling, you and I have had a couple \nof occasions where it was made very clear to me that that \ncomputation, whether a defendant believes it\u2019s correct or \nnot, cannot come back to me to secure any kind of\u2014is that \nright, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. STERLING: That is correct, Your Honor. I \nthink there\u2019s a distinction here, although it\u2019s one without \na difference, and that is this; if a defendant is being held \nsolely on this Court\u2019s violation order, then he would get \n\nAppendix G\n223a\ncredit. However, at least six months for these gentlemen, \nbecause they received credit for six months on The State \ncase, they would not get credit for. And the way The Court \nis supposed to accomplish that is by imposing a higher \nsentence than what you normally would have, but you can\u2019t \ndo that here because you sentenced them at the statutory \nmaximum. So I think for the record that explains [71]that.\nWith regard to the protection order issue that Mr. \nSchuman raised between the two; again, that is a matter \nthat will be addressed by the BOP relative to their security \nconcerns.\nTHE COURT: Right. I do hope both of you gentlemen \nare up the road rather than some distant isolated federal \nfacility that, from a practical standpoint, will make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to bring your family to have a \nface-to-face visitation or contact. I think, candidly, with \njust about everybody who comes before me, confining them \nas close to home as possible is an important component \nultimately of reentry and rehabilitation. Family contact is \nand remains, in my view, important. But, once again, Mr. \nSchuman, that\u2019s all that I can do. I\u2019ll take note of that. I\u2019ll \ncertainly expect the Bureau of Prisons to accurately and \nattentively calculate the proper credit for time served.\nMR. SCHUMAN: I understand, Your Honor.\nMy only last comment is my client indicates that The \nCourt previously directed the Marshals to correct his last \nname to Jaimez. Apparently it didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll leave it \nat that.\n\nAppendix G\n224a\nTHE COURT: I will so instruct the Marshals. May \nI suggest that you go on upstairs and get in touch with \n[72]Alex and both, formally and informally, make that \nrequest. I also suggest that you send a copy of that\u2014CC \nthat request to Pete Elliot, who\u2019s the U.S. Marshal. And \nI also suggest, follow up on it.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: In that respect, a phone call from me \nto anybody needing my help, I\u2019m glad to do that. I really \nam. I now remember I think that had occurred before the \nlast\u2014the last supervised release proceedings.\nMR. SCHUMAN: I think so, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And I apologize, I had forgotten that. \nMr. Watters is still\u2014Mr. Jaimez.\nMR. SCHUMAN: Jaimez.\nTHE COURT:\u2014is still being considered to be Mr. \nTimothy Watters. So that\u2019s why\u2014\nMR. SCHUMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN: Your Honor, I think we were having a \ndiscussion, and I don\u2019t think Mr. Schuman answered the \nBostic question.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\n\nAppendix G\n225a\nMS. DUSTIN: I don\u2019t think Mr. Schuman answered \nthe Bostic question.\nTHE COURT: Okay. Any other objections not \npreviously made, Mr. Schuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN: No, Your Honor.\n[73]MS. STERLING: Mr. Wagner, once again?\nMR. WAGNER: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Okay. That will conclude this \nproceeding.\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY: Your Honor, there\u2019s a \npending motion to be addressed on the record about Mr. \nWatters.\nTHE COURT: You have some motions, Mr. Schuman, \npreviously made that are going to be withdrawn; is that \ncorrect?\nMR.

WATTERS, \nDefendant-Appellant.\nAppeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Northern District of Ohio at Toledo. \nNo. 3:10-cr-00004-2\u2014James G. Carr, District Judge.\nDecided and Filed: March 12, 2024\nBefore: GRIFFIN, THAPAR, and \nNALBANDIAN, Circuit Judges.\nOPINION\nTHAPAR, Circuit Judge. Timothy Jaimez pled guilty \nto federal drug charges. After his second supervised-\nrelease violation, the district court sentenced him to \n\nAppendix I\n230a\nsixty months\u2019 imprisonment. Because that sentence is \nprocedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm.\nI.\nTimothy Jaimez pled guilty to conspiring to possess \nnarcotics with the intent to distribute them. After serving \ntime in prison, he began a term of supervised release. \nWhile on release, Jaimez used drugs, failed to maintain \nemployment, and failed to truthfully disclose financial \ninformation to his probation officer. So a court revoked \nhis release.\nWhen Jaimez began a second term of supervised \nrelease, his behavior didn\u2019t improve. Police found him \ntransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction. And at Jaimez\u2019s properties, police \nfound cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press. Based \non this conduct, an Ohio court found Jaimez guilty of \nattempting to traffic marijuana.\nThe United States then sought to revoke Jaimez\u2019s \nrelease. It alleged three violations: (1) being charged with \na new crime, (2) associating with known felons, and (3) \npossessing drug paraphernalia. In line with probation\u2019s \nreport, the court classified Jaimez\u2019s first violation as \n\u201cGrade A\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S.S.G. \n\u00a7\u00a07B1.1(a)(1). That carried a sentencing range of fifty-one \nto sixty months\u2019 incarceration. See id. \u00a7\u00a07B1.4(a); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e)(3). Over Jaimez\u2019s objection, the district court \nsentenced him to sixty months\u2019 incarceration, followed by \nsix years of supervised release.\n\nAppendix I\n231a\nII.\nJaimez now appeals, claiming his sentence is \nprocedurally and substantively unreasonable. Applying \nan abuse-of-discretion standard, we conclude that it\u2019s \nneither. See United States v. Adams, 873 F.3d 512, 516-17 \n(6th Cir. 2017).\nA.\nJaimez first challenges his sentence\u2019s procedural \nreasonableness. He argues the court (1) inadequately \nexplained his sentence, (2) improperly considered section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and (3) incorrectly classified his \nrelease violation as Grade A. Jaimez is wrong on all three \ncounts.\nAdequate Explanation. A court need not \u201cengage in \na ritualistic incantation\u201d of statutory sentencing factors. \nUnited States v. Chandler, 419 F.3d 484, 488 (6th Cir. \n2005) (citation omitted). Nor must a court explicitly \naddress every factor. United States v. Collington, 461 \nF.3d 805, 809 (6th Cir. 2006). Rather, the record needs to \nshow only that the court considered the applicable factors. \nUnited States v. McBride, 434 F.3d 470, 474 (6th Cir. 2006).\nJaimez\u2019s sentencing passes this very easy test. During \nsentencing, the court discussed Jaimez\u2019s Guidelines range \nwith the parties. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(4)(B), 3583(e). The \ncourt referenced Jaimez\u2019s criminal history and previous \nrelease violations. See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1), 3583(e). The court \nalso sought to deter Jaimez and others from violating \n\nAppendix I\n232a\nrelease conditions. See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(B), 3583(e). And \nthe court recognized a need to promote respect for the \nlaw and protect the public. See id. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), (C), \n3583(e); see also United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393, \n399 (6th Cir. 2007). Given this record, it\u2019s clear the court \nconsidered the federal sentencing factors.\nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) Factors. Jaimez next takes issue \nwith the factors the court did expressly consider: the \nseriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the \nlaw, and the provision of just punishment. Jaimez argues \nthe court shouldn\u2019t have considered these factors because \nthe statute governing revocation doesn\u2019t require it. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). But we\u2019ve made clear that district courts \nmay nonetheless consider these factors when imposing \nrevocation sentences. See Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400; \nUnited States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1163, 1167-70 (6th Cir. \n2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied, 95 F.4th 454, 2024 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 5523, 2024 WL 981140 (6th Cir. 2024).1 Thus, it \nwasn\u2019t unreasonable for the court to consider them here.\nViolation Grade. A release violation is \u201cGrade A\u201d if it \ninvolves drug conduct punishable by more than a year in \nprison. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a07B1.1(a)(1). Here, there was sufficient \nevidence of such conduct. First, police witnessed Jaimez \nand his co-felons transport \u201cjust under a kilogram\u201d of \nmarijuana in his car. R. 381, Pg. ID 2169. Second, Jaimez\u2019s \ncar smelled like marijuana, suggesting Jaimez\u2014a past \n1.\u2002 Judge Griffin adheres to his dissent from the denial of the \npetition to rehear Esteras en banc. United States v. Esteras, 95 \nF.4th 454, 2024 U.S. App. LEXIS 5523, 2024 WL 981140, at *1 (6th \nCir. 2024) (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n\nAppendix I\n233a\ndrug user\u2014knew there were drugs in it. Third, an \nOhio court found Jaimez guilty of attempted marijuana \ntrafficking, indicating he knew or had reason to know the \nmarijuana was intended for resale. See Ohio Rev. Code \nAnn. \u00a7\u00a02923.02(A) (noting that an \u201cattempt\u201d conviction \nmeans the defendant met any \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d \nelements of the underlying crime); id. \u00a7\u00a0 2925.03(A)\n(2) (defining mens rea for drug trafficking). Based on \nthis evidence, a court could conclude Jaimez knowingly \ntransported just under a kilogram of marijuana, aware it \nwas intended for resale. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(3) (setting \na preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for revocation \ndecisions). And under Ohio law, that\u2019s punishable by over \na year in prison.2 Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02925.03(A)(2), \n(C)(3)(c), 2929.14(A)(4). Thus, the district court correctly \ngraded Jaimez\u2019s violation.\nB.\nJaimez next alleges his sentence is substantively \nunreasonable. In particular, he argues the court (1) placed \ntoo much weight on the conduct underlying his release \nviolation, (2) inflicted \u201cdouble punishment\u201d by considering \nconduct for which Ohio already punished him, and (3) \nimposed a sentence that was too long in light of mitigating \nevidence. Again, Jaimez is wrong on all three counts.\n2.\u2002 Ohio found Jaimez guilty of only a misdemeanor-level \nmarijuana offense. But when a federal court grades a release \nviolation, it considers the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, not just the \nrecord of conviction. United States v. Montgomery, 893 F.3d 935, \n940 (6th Cir. 2018).\n\nAppendix I\n234a\nJaimez\u2019s Violative Conduct. At sentencing, the district \ncourt \u201ckeyed in\u201d on the conduct underlying Jaimez\u2019s release \nviolation. Appellant Suppl. Br. 2. For good reason: Jaimez \nwas originally convicted for conspiring to distribute drugs, \nand he had previously violated his supervised release \nby using drugs. Given this background, the conduct \nunderlying his most recent violation\u2014transporting drugs \nwith the intent to resell them\u2014was particularly relevant. \nWhen imposing revocation sentences, courts may consider \nthe need to promote deterrence and respect for the law. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2014(B), 3583(e); see Lewis, 498 \nF.3d at 399. Jaimez\u2019s most recent violation demonstrated a \nflagrant lack of both. Thus, it was reasonable for the court \nto give substantial weight to that violation at sentencing. \nCf. United States v. Zobel, 696 F.3d 558, 571-72 (6th Cir. \n2012).\nDouble Punishment. Jaimez next argues he received \n\u201cdouble punishment\u201d for his drug-trafficking activity. \nAppellant Suppl. Br. 3. But this presents no error, either. \nTo be sure, Ohio already punished Jaimez for the drug-\nrelated conduct that the district court considered at \nsentencing. But that\u2019s the point: the Sentencing Guidelines \nexplicitly tell courts to consider the criminal nature of \na release violation. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07B1.1(a), .4(a). And \nthe Supreme Court has long held that federal and state \ngovernments may separately punish an individual for the \nsame conduct. See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, \n88, 106 S.\u00a0Ct. 433, 88 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 387 (1985); Fox v. Ohio, \n46 U.S. (5 How.) 410, 435, 12 L.\u00a0Ed. 213 (1847).\nJaimez\u2019s argument also fails for a simpler reason: \nrevocation sentences are never \u201cpunishment\u201d for a \n\nAppendix I\n235a\nrelease violation. Rather, these sentences are \u201cpart of \nthe penalty for the initial offense\u201d\u2014in this case, Jaimez\u2019s \noriginal narcotics-distribution conspiracy. Johnson v. \nUnited States, 529 U.S. 694, 700-01, 120 S.\u00a0Ct. 1795, 146 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 727 (2000). Indeed, even when a court expressly \nconsiders the conduct underlying a release violation, we \ndon\u2019t interpret the resulting sentence as \u201cpunishment\u201d \nfor that conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 640 \nF.3d 195, 203 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding that a revocation \nsentence is a \u201csanction\u201d for a defendant\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d \nnot a \u201cpunishment for [his] violation\u201d (citation omitted)); \nUnited States v. Jones, 81 F.4th 591, 602 n.7 (6th Cir. \n2023) (same); Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1170 (holding that a \ncourt\u2019s consideration of violative conduct doesn\u2019t make a \nrevocation sentence punitive, even when the court uses the \nword \u201cpunishment\u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s sentence \ndidn\u2019t \u201cdouble punish\u201d Jaimez for his violation.\nSentence Length. At the outset, we presume Jaimez\u2019s \nwithin-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. See Jones, \n81 F.4th at 602. Jaimez contends otherwise. He argues \nthe court shouldn\u2019t have applied the maximum sentence \nbecause his release violations could have been worse. He \nalso asserts that he\u2019s been trying to \u201crebuild[] his life.\u201d \nReply Br. 3. And he emphasizes that he didn\u2019t contest his \nrelease violations or his Ohio drug charge. This, he claims, \ndemonstrates his \u201cremorse.\u201d Id.\nBut Jaimez\u2019s arguments aren\u2019t enough to establish \nunreasonableness. The fact Jaimez could\u2019ve committed \na worse offense doesn\u2019t render the statutory maximum \nunreasonable. Every drug trafficker could have shipped \n\nAppendix I\n236a\nmore drugs, just like every murderer could have killed an \nadditional person. That doesn\u2019t mean courts should never \napply a maximum sentence.\nNor can Jaimez show unreasonableness by arguing \nhe would have given more weight to mitigating evidence. \nSee United States v. Ely, 468 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2006). \nAnd even if he could, his mitigating evidence is paper-\nthin. While his words suggested remorse, his conduct \ndid not. At Jaimez\u2019s last revocation hearing, the court \nwarned him that he\u2019d receive a sixty-month sentence if he \ndidn\u2019t straighten out his act. That didn\u2019t stop Jaimez from \ncontinuing to flout the law.

LEAKS, JR.,\nDefendant.\nVIOLATION HEARING\nREPORTER\u2019S TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS \nBEFORE THE HONORABLE PATRICIA A. \nGAUGHAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n*\u00a0*\u00a0*\u00a0*\u00a0*\n[79a]CLEVELAND, OHIO; \nTHURSDAY, JUNE 29, 2023; 11:08 A.M.\n\nAppendix J\n238a\nPROCEEDINGS\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY: All rise.\nTHE COURT: Please be seated.\nMr. Leaks, you may approach the podium with counsel. \nWe\u2019re here in the matter of United States of America \nvs. Toriano Leaks, Jr., Case Number 19-cr-283.\nPresent in court is Mr. Leaks; is that correct, sir? \nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: Represented by his attorney, Mr. \nJustin Roberts; on behalf of the government, Mr. Scott \nZarzycki; on behalf of Probation, Mr. Robert Capuano \nstanding in for DeMario Reynolds.\nPROBATION OFFICER: Good morning, Your Honor \nTHE COURT: Good morning.\nSir, we\u2019re here this morning for purposes of a \nsupervised release violation hearing. I have before me a \nviolation report dated February 13th of this year and a \nsupplemental information report dated June 15th, 2023. \nAnd I should add also, supplemental information report \nof June 5th.\nMr. Roberts, I\u2019m going to assume you are in receipt \nall three of these reports.\n\nAppendix J\n239a\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor.\n[80a]THE COURT: Same question, Mr. Zarzycki.\nMR. ZARZYCKI: Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. According to these reports, \nthere are six alleged violations.\nThe first is a new law violation.\nOn May 11th of this year Mr. Leaks pled guilty to one \ncount of robbery and received a sentence of 4 to 6 years. \nThe second is a new law violation.\nMr. Capuano, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but this \nmatter has not been resolved and there is an outstanding \nwarrant. Am I correct?\nPROBATION OFFICER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. It is generally my practice not \nto consider new law violations that have not been resolved, \nso I am not going to consider alleged Violation Number 2.\nNumber 3, failure to report.\nMr. Leaks failed to report on May 18th, May 31st, \nand June 8th of 2022.\nThe fourth is failure to attend mental health treatment.\n\nAppendix J\n240a\nHe failed to attend group session on May 13th, May \n24th, and June 1st of 2022.\nFifth, failure to work towards GED.\nHe failed to work toward getting the GED\u2014GED \nsince commencing supervision.\nAnd finally, a new law violation.\nOn May 11th, 2023, Mr. Leaks pled guilty to having \na weapon while under disability with a 3-year sentence to \nrun concurrent with the new law violation that I\u2019ve already \ndiscussed, Violation Number 1.\nMr. Roberts, on behalf of your client, do you wish \nfor this Court to hear testimony regarding these alleged \nviolations, or do you waive the taking of testimony and \nadmit?\nMR. ROBERTS: Your Honor, in light of the fact that \nthe Court is not considering Violation Number 2 at the \ntime, we waive the testimony and do admit to the other \nviolations.\nTHE COURT: Sir, do you understand what your \nattorney just said to me?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: And do you, in fact, admit to Violations \n1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?\n\nAppendix J\n241a\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: Sir, based upon your admission, I do \nin fact find you to be in violation of supervised release.\nI find that the most serious is a Grade B violation, \n[82a]and with a Criminal History Category of III you \nare looking at an advisory sentencing guideline range of \n8 to 14 months.\nOn the issue of sentencing, Mr. Roberts, should I turn \nto you first or your client?\nMR. ROBERTS: Your Honor, just briefly, we \nunderstand because of the nature of the violation that \nthe Court is required by statute to impose a term of \nimprisonment. We would ask the Court to run any term \nof imprisonment concurrent to the now 4 to 6 years that \nMr. Leaks received. He obviously accepted responsibility \nfor that case and, actually, when you look at the purposes \nof sentencing, at least on a supervised release violation, \nTitle 18 United States Code \u00a7\u00a03583(a) specifically omits \nthe Court\u2019s consideration of Title 18 United States Code \n3553(a)(2) which otherwise would be present in a regular \nsentencing, that being the seriousness of the offense, \nrespect for law and punishment. All of those are omitted \nfrom a supervised release sentencing and have been \naddressed with the 4 to 6-year sentence that he received \nfor the conduct in the new law violation.\nWe would ask the Court to consider that he\u2019s going \nto be on 18 months\u2019 mandatory post-release control also \n\nAppendix J\n242a\non that case and will continue to be supervised by court \nofficials as he seeks to re-enter the community and \nrehabilitate himself.\n[83a]Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Leaks, do you have anything to \nsay, sir?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Um .\u00a0.\u00a0. I just would like to \nsay that I learned my lesson and I want to make sure \nthat I influence my younger family members that look \nup to me and think, what are we doing or whatever I was \ncontributing to was cool, that this ain\u2019t the way to go.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Zarzycki.\nMR. ZARZYCKI: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIt\u2019s the government\u2019s position that a consecutive \nguideline sentence is appropriate for Mr. Leaks, under \n7B1.3(f), that it was to be served consecutively to a \nsentence of imprisonment.\nYour Honor, this involved a\u2014as the Court\u2019s aware \nfrom having his original case, involved the Possession \nof Machine Gun and next to this machine gun\u2014which \nwas functional\u2014there were three magazines, 15 rounds, \n20 rounds and 30 rounds. So his violations\u2014like, he \nwas sentenced to 4 years for the criminal offenses that \nhe committed. I ask the Court to impose a consecutive \nsentence because of the violations of this Court\u2019s \n\nAppendix J\n243a\nsupervision, and that supervision was based on the prior \noffense of\u2014or his conviction of having this dangerous \nmachine gun.\nNow, one of his offenses to which he\u2019s been convicted \n[84a]in state court involves another firearm as recently \nas February of this year.\nAnother offense is a robbery that is an offense of \nviolence as well as his failure to adhere to any of the\u2014or \nmany of the requirements of his supervision.\nI believe that a consecutive sentence would be \nappropriate for those violations.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Capuano.\nPROBATION OFFICER: Hello, Your Honor.\nYour Honor, U.S. Probation Office would just like \nto add that, unfortunately, this is a very unfortunate \ncircumstance for Mr. Leaks. Mr. Leaks is a very young \nman. He has a lot of future ahead of him and these are \nsome very serious charges that he has in front of him \nviolations-wise. \nIn regard to recommendations, Your Honor, we would \nalso recommend that a term of imprisonment is imposed \nand that it be served consecutive to his state sentence as \nwell.\n\nAppendix J\n244a\nOriginally we were recommending a term of \nsupervised release to follow as well. However, based upon \nhis state sentences, he does have mandatory post-release \ncontrol with the State of Ohio with the Adult Parole \nAuthority and we would not be opposed to\u2014if he does not \nhave supervised release through us, Your Honor, following \nthe sentence.\nThank you.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Roberts, anything else?\n[85a]MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, other than \nto just to reiterate, I know there\u2019s been reference to the \nseriousness of the offenses, both the original offense and \nthe new offense, and I would just reiterate that he\u2019s been \nsentenced and is serving his time for those.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: And yet I agree with all of the \nstatements made by Mr. Zarzycki. To be on supervision \nand have five violations, two of which are new law violations, \nboth involving firearms, and the original offense here \ninvolved a machine gun. Concurrent time does not punish \nMr. Leaks for violating supervision and\u2014and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that is \nnot justice.\nTherefore, it is the judgment of this Court that you \nbe committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to \nbe imprisoned for a term of 12 months consecutive to the \ntime being served in the two state cases.\n\nAppendix J\n245a\nThere will be no further supervision.\nMr. Leaks, I wish you the best, and I certainly hope \nyou turn your life around because you are a very young \nman, as Mr. Capuano pointed out.\nBoy, this is not the road to go down. You\u2019re going to \nbe in and out of prisons the rest of your life. I see it. I see \nit with one defendant after another.\nI don\u2019t want that for you. I hope this is your [86a]\nwake-up call.\nGood luck.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nMR. ROBERTS: Your Honor, just on Mr. Leaks\u2019 \nbehalf, if\u2014\nTHE COURT: One moment, sir.\nMR. ROBERTS: We would just object to the \nconsideration of punishment as it relates to the sentence. \nI understand all of the other factors the Court may have \nconsidered, but as it relates to considering punishment \nfrom the new offense, we would object in case he wants \nto perfect any kind of appeal on that issue.\nThank you.\n\nAppendix J\n246a\nTHE COURT: All righty.\nSir, you certainly have the right to appeal, if you so \nchoose.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Okay.\nMR. ZARZYCKI: Are we adjourned, Your Honor? \nTHE COURT: Oh, we\u2019re adjourned. I\u2019m sorry. \n(Proceedings adjourned at 11:19 a.m.)\n\nAppendix K\n247a\nAPPENDIX K \u2014 ORDER OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN \nDISTRICT OF OHIO, EASTERN DIVISION, \nFILED JUNE 29, 2023\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nEASTERN DIVISION\nCASE NO.: 1:19CR283\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\n-vs-\nTORIANO A. LEAKS, JR., \nDefendant,\nJUDGE PATRICIA A. GAUGHAN\nORDER\nA Supervised Release Revocation Hearing was held \non June 29, 2023. Assistant U. S. Attorney Scott Zarzycki \nwas present on behalf of the Government. Defendant \nToriano A. Leaks, Jr. was present and represented by his \ncounsel Justin Roberts. Probation Officer Rob Capuano \nwas present on behalf of the Probation Department. The \ndefendant waived his right to an evidentiary hearing and \nadmitted to violating the conditions of his supervised \n\nAppendix K\n248a\nrelease, to wit: new law violations, failure to report, \nfailure to attend mental health treatment, and failure to \nwork towards his GED. The Court finds the most serious \nviolation to be a Grade B.\nThis Court hereby sentences the defendant, Toriano \nA. Leaks, Jr., to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for \na period of 12 months to run consecutively to his two state \nsentences in case numbers CR-21-666036 -A and CR-23-\n678409-A. The Court does not order further supervision.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n/s/ Patricia A. Gaugha\t\n\t\nPatricia A. Gaugha \nUnited States District Court\nDate: June 29, 2023\n\nAppendix L\n249a\nAPPENDIX L \u2014 ORDER OF THE UNITED STATES \nCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT, \nFILED MARCH 6, 2024\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\nNo. 23-3547\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\nv.\nTORIANO A. LEAKS, JR.,\nDefendant-Appellant.\nFiled: March 6, 2024\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES \nDISTRICT COURT FOR THE \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nORDER\nBefore: BOGGS, WHITE, and THAPAR, Circuit \nJudges.\nToriano A. Leaks, Jr. appeals the sentence imposed \nafter the district court revoked his term of supervised \nrelease. The parties do not request oral argument, and \n\nAppendix L\n250a\nthis panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is \nnot needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a). Because Leaks\u2019s \nargument is foreclosed by precedent, we affirm.\nIn 2019, Leaks pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally \npossessing a machine gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a0922(o) and 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced him \nto thirty months of imprisonment. After serving his \nprison term, Leaks began a three-year term of supervised \nrelease.\nIn February 2023, Leaks\u2019s probation officer filed \na report charging him with violating his terms of \nsupervision by committing state robbery, tampering, and \nfirearms offenses, failing to report to his probation officer, \nfailing to attend mental-health treatment, and failing to \nwork towards his GED. After Leaks pleaded guilty to \ntwo of the state offenses, he admitted that he violated \nthe terms of his supervised release. The district court \nimposed a within-guidelines sentence of twelve months \nof imprisonment, to run consecutively with Leaks\u2019s state \nsentence.\nOn appeal, Leaks argues that the district court \nimpermissibly relied on the need to reflect the seriousness \nof the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide \njust punishment when fashioning his sentence. Although \nthose factors are listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), he \nargues, Congress deliberately omitted them from the \nsupervised-release statute under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\n\nAppendix L\n251a\nLeaks acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed \nby United States v. Lewis. 498 F.3d 393, 399-400 (6th Cir. \n2007) (\u201c[I]t does not constitute reversible error to consider \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for violation \nof supervised release, even though this factor is not \nenumerated in \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\u201d). He nevertheless argues that \nthe case was wrongly decided. But absent an intervening, \ninconsistent opinion of the Supreme Court or this court \nsitting en banc overruling the decision, we are bound by \nour holding in Lewis. See Freed v. Thomas, 81 F.4th 655, \n659 (6th Cir. 2023) (citing Salmi v. Sec\u2019y of Health and \nHum. Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985)); see also \nUnited States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1163, 1167-68 (6th Cir.), \nreh\u2019g en banc denied, 88 F.4th 1170 (2023).\nFor these reasons, we AFFIRM.",

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson used the word \u201cpunishment\u201d during \nthe hearing.  But this reference occurred at the beginning of the sentencing phase of the hearing \nand simply set the stage.  In her words, \u201cI find that the new law violation\u201d occurred and that she \nmay \u201cconsider\u201d \u201cevidence\u201d of it \u201cin the punishment I will issue today.\u201d  R.439 at 81.  This \nmanner of speaking at the beginning of a sentencing hearing does not remotely convey an intent \nto impose a retributive sentence in the context of a gun-possession violation that required \n\u201cpunishment\u201d\u2014the revocation of supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).  Likewise, when \nthe judge later used the word \u201cpunitive\u201d in describing the conditions of supervised release, R.439 \nat 95, it was to ensure that the sentence was not too long\u2014that the \u201cdeprivation of [Esteras\u2019s] \nliberty\u201d was \u201cno greater . . . than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth\u201d in the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2) sections, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2).  Surely, shorthand references to \nAppendix B\n12a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 10 \n\u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d in the context of ensuring a sentence is not too long do not convey a \nforbidden focus on retribution.  \nWe AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation order. \nAppendix B\n13a\n\nPEARSON, J.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nEASTERN DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nEDGARDO ESTERAS,\nDefendant.\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nCASE NO.  4:14-CR-425-10\nJUDGE BENITA Y. PEARSON\nORDER\nOn September 6, 2018, Defendant Edgardo Esteras was sentenced to a 12-month term of\nincarceration as to Count 1 of the Indictment for conspiracy to distribute heroin, such term to be\nserved consecutively to the 15-month term of incarceration imposed for the probation violation in\nCase No. 4:11-CR-276-12-DAP, followed by a six-year term of supervised release, with standard\nand special conditions of supervision imposed.  Defendant was further ordered to pay a $100.00\nspecial assessment.  \nFollowing Defendant\u2019s term of incarceration, supervised release commenced on January\n10, 2020.\nOn or about February 20, 2020, the United States Probation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) submitted a\nSupervision Report to request a suspension of the GED condition:\nThis report serves to request a suspension of the General Education Diploma (GED)\ncondition.  Before incarceration, Mr. Esteras was diagnosed with an intellectual\ndevelopment disorder indicating difficulty with reading, writing, and comprehension. \nThe undersigned officer has had multiple conversations with Mr. Esteras regarding the\ncondition.  Mr. Esteras has expressed a willingness to work toward obtaining his GED,\nbut disclosed that he has tried and does not think he is capable of comprehending the\nmaterial.\nAppendix C\n14a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn July 20, 2020, the Court ordered suspension of the GED requirement under the\ncircumstances described.\nOn or about September 19, 2022, the USPO issued a Supervision Report to relay a\nrequest from Defendant for early termination of his term of supervised release.  \nOn September 21, 2022, the Court denied Defendant\u2019s request for early termination of\nsupervised release, without prejudice to another request being considered at a later time.\nOn or about January 23, 2023, the USPO issued a Violation Report to notify the Court of\nDefendant\u2019s violation of the terms and conditions of his supervised release:\n-New Criminal Charges (filing is pending with Youngstown Municipal Court)\n-Violent Conduct\n-Whereabouts Unknown (Absconder)\nOn January 23, 2023, at 0003 hours, Officers with the Youngstown Police Department\nwere dispatched to 1137 Inverness Avenue in Youngstown in reference to gunfire.  Upon\narrival, contact was made with the victim, who advised the father of her children,\nEdgardo Esteras, had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her.  At\napproximately 2350 hours, Mr. Esteras stormed into the residence, struck the victim in\nthe head, punched a television set, and then stormed outside of the residence.  The victim\nfollowed Mr. Edgardo out of the residence who was now inside a vehicle.  The victim\nreached inside the vehicle to grab Mr. Esteras car keys, at which time he produced a\nhandgun and pointed it at the victim and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d.  At this time, the\nvictim retreated inside the residence at which time Mr. Esteras fired three rounds into her\nvehicle, an Infiniti JX35, which was located in the driveway of the residence.  Mr. Esteras\nthen fled the scene in a Black Chevy Blazer with an unknown registration. \nOfficers recovered spent 9mm shell casings and observed three bullet holes in the side of\nMI\u2019s vehicle, as well as a broken television set.  The victim refused medical treatment but\ndid advise she wished to file charges of domestic violence against Mr. Esteras.  The\nvictim further advised that Mr. Esteras frequently assaults her, and she has had enough. \nThe Youngstown Police Department is currently pursuing charges of Domestic Violence,\nIllegal Discharge of a Firearm, and Vehicular Vandalism. Formal charges have not been\nofficially filed and Mr. Esteras remains at large as of the time of this report.\nOn January 23, 2023, the Court ordered the issuance of a Warrant for Defendant\u2019s arrest.\n2\nAppendix C\n15a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn or about January 30, 2023, the USPO issued a Follow Up Violation Report to provide\nan update to the Court on Defendant\u2019s violations:\n1.\nNew Law Violation:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with\nDomestic Violence (M1), Aggravated Menacing (M1), and Criminal\nDamaging/Endangering (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under case\nnumber 2023CRB00121. \n2.\nPossession of a Firearm:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras did have in his\npossession or under his control a firearm. \nDefendant was arrested and appeared before Magistrate Judge Amanda M. Knapp on\nJanuary 31, 2023 for an initial appearance.  On February 6, 2023, Magistrate Judge Knapp\nconducted preliminary and detention hearings.  The Court found that probable cause existed for\nthe violations, and additional proceedings would be conducted by the undersigned.  Defendant\nwas remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\nOn or about March 14, 2023, the USPO issued a Supplemental Information Report to\nprovide an update to the Court regarding the status of Defendant\u2019s state charges:\nOn January 22, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with Domestic Violence (M1), Aggravated\nMenacing (M1), and Criminal Damaging (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under\ncase number 2023CRB00121Y.  On February 22, 2023, all charges were dismissed at\nrequest of the victim.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court conducted a Supervised Release Violation Hearing and \nSentencing, at which time Defendant denied Violation Numbers 1 and 2.  Officer Robert\nDiMaiolo testified on direct examination by the Government, with cross examination by the\ndefense.  The Government played a bodycam video (Exhibit 5) of the victim and her family\u2019s\nearly morning interactions with law enforcement officers shortly after the above referenced\n3\nAppendix C\n16a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\ncrimes occurred.1  During those recorded interactions, no one indicated a perpetrator other than\nDefendant.  The alleged victim testified that, after that early morning interaction with law\nenforcement, she went to municipal court and reported Defendant as the perpetrator of the\ncrimes.  Despite the strong evidence against Defendant, the victim attempted (unpersuasively) to\nrecant, when examined on direct examination by defense counsel.  The  Government effectively\ncross examined the victim and submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 5, which were\nadmitted without objection.  The Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant\npossessed a firearm, in violation of the terms of his supervised release, sustaining Violation No.\n2.  The Court proceeded to pronounce sentence after allocution. \nSentencing\nAmong other things, the Court has considered the evidence presented at the violation\nhearing, statutory maximum penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); the advisory policy\nstatements set forth in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines; and the\nsuggested range of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).  Furthermore, the Court has\nconsidered the factors and conditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(d),\nrespectively.\nBased upon the Court\u2019s review and for the reasons set forth on the record, Defendant\u2019s\nterm of supervised release is revoked.

Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n____________________ \nDISSENT \n____________________ \nKAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.1  \nThe top line of any sentence is generally the term of incarceration.  What catches the eye is how \nlong the defendant will be in prison, not how long the defendant will remain under court \nsupervision.  But in the federal system, supervised release\u2014the often years\u2019 long period of court \nsupervision and restrictions following incarceration\u2014comes with the specter of more time in a \ncell.  Judges may \u201crevoke\u201d a defendant\u2019s supervised release if a defendant violates court-ordered \nconditions, sending the defendant back to prison for months or possibly years.  After Edgardo \nEsteras spent twelve months in federal prison on his original term of incarceration, the judge in \nhis case sentenced him to 24 more months in prison\u2014double his original sentence\u2014for violating \nconditions of supervised release.  R. 439 (Revocation Tr. at 85:13\u201321) (Page ID #2887). \nRevocation of supervised release is immensely impactful, and sometimes carries \nconsequences even greater than an original term of incarceration.  In sentencing Esteras after \nrevoking his supervised release, the district court focused on the retributive purpose of the \nadditional term of incarceration.  See, e.g., id. at 81:17\u201322 (Page ID #2883) (explaining what \ninformation can be considered \u201cin the punishment I will issue today\u201d (emphasis added)); id. at \n83:9\u201311 (Page ID #2885) (\u201c[W]hat\u2019s been done before isn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter you, to \nencourage you to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d (emphasis added)).  But the \nsupervised-release statute tells district courts not to consider punishment as a purpose when \nimposing or revoking supervised release.  When defense counsel objected to the district court\u2019s \n \n1The court received a petition for rehearing en banc concerning the original order in this case, which \nfollowed binding Sixth Circuit precedent.  The petition for rehearing en banc was circulated to the entire court, and \nless than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing the original order en banc.  Following circulation to the \nfull court of the en banc petition, however, the panel revised its prior order and circulated it to the en banc court.  En \nbanc rehearing of the prior order was warranted, which is why I dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  And en \nbanc rehearing remains warranted now that the panel is issuing an amended order, because that revised decision \nlikewise relies on the same mistaken precedent.  Because both the original and revised orders rely on United States \nv. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), I have addressed both in this dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  \nEsteras is of course free to petition for en banc rehearing again, now that the panel has filed a revised and published \ndecision. \nAppendix D\n21a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nimpermissible consideration of certain statutory factors embodying retributive purposes, the \ndistrict court confirmed that it relied heavily on \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law\u201d in reaching its \nsentence, which represented an upward variance.  Id. at 92:16\u201318 (Page ID #2894).  In effect, \nthere is a real chance that Esteras was essentially punished twice, raising concerns of a \nconstitutional dimension and flagrantly violating Congress\u2019s intent in any event.  Our precedent \nthat allows district courts to consider unenumerated sentencing factors when revoking supervised \nrelease, United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), relies on atextual reasoning directly \ncontrary to Congress\u2019s purposes.  It is an outlier among the circuits.  Our failure today to correct \nLewis\u2019s basic mistakes usurps Congress\u2019s role, runs afoul of rudimentary principles of statutory \ninterpretation, and ultimately undermines the purposes of supervised release.  Today\u2019s decision \nin this case serves only to prolong our unfortunate adherence to a mistaken precedent. \nToday\u2019s opinion defends Lewis on two grounds:  \u201cone textual, [and] one contextual.\u201d  \nAmended Order at 5.  Neither ground supports Lewis or today\u2019s decision.  The statutory text is \nclear.  It directs district judges to take account of certain sentencing factors, but not others, when \nrevoking supervised release.  Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a court \u201cmay, after considering the \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and \n(a)(7),\u201d terminate, modify, extend, or revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release.  Notably \nabsent from this list is \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which directs district courts to consider \u201cthe need for the \nsentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Canons of statutory construction dictate that this \nomission was intentional and command district courts not to take account of the (a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intel. & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (declining to extend Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading \nrequirements to complaints alleging municipal liability because \u201cthe Federal Rules do address in \nRule 9(b) the question of the need for greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do not \ninclude among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability\u201d); \nid. (\u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d); Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in \nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \nAppendix D\n22a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, \n472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972))). \nSimply put, Lewis and today\u2019s opinion offer no explanation for why Congress \ndeliberately chose to include some, but not all, of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in \u00a7 3583(e).  Today\u2019s \nopinion declares that \u00a7 3583 \u201cgenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised- \nrelease decisions after considering the listed factors.\u201d  Amended Order at 5 (citing Lewis, \n498 F.3d at 400).  But neither Lewis nor the instant opinion can ground this contention in the \nstatutory text.  Rather, \u00a7 3583(e) explicitly constrains the exercise of discretion, directing district \ncourts to focus on only the enumerated factors.  Had Congress wished for district courts to \nconsider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, it would have made \u00a7 3583(e) coterminous with \u00a7 3553(a).  \nCongress did not.  See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1813 (2019) \n(explaining that courts should not rely on the \u201cdoubtful proposition that Congress sought to \naccomplish in a \u2018surpassingly strange manner\u2019 what it could have accomplished in a much more \nstraightforward way\u201d (quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. \n639, 647 (2012))). \nThe context follows from the text.  In Tapia v. United States, the Supreme Court \nexplained that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(D) reflects \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally\u201d:  \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\u201d  564 U.S. 319, 325 \n(2011).  The statute\u2019s \u201cprovisions make clear that a particular purpose may apply differently, or \neven not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.\u201d  Id. at 326.  Following \nthe statute\u2019s plain text, \u201ca court may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  Section \u00a7 3583(e), which \npertains to revoking supervised release, is the mirror-image of \u00a7 3583(c), which pertains to \nimposing a term of supervised release.  It follows that both subsections direct district courts not \nto consider retribution when imposing or revoking supervised release. \nFaced with this obvious hurdle, today\u2019s decision attempts to rewrite Tapia.  Of course, \nI need not put much gloss on what Justice Kagan straightforwardly said in that opinion:  a district \ncourt cannot rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when making decisions concerning supervised \nrelease.  Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326.  Today\u2019s decision attempts to skirt this plain statement through \nAppendix D\n23a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \ntwo paragraphs of explanation of what Justice Kagan supposedly must have meant.  I, like \nJustice Kagan, prefer to rely on the actual text of the statute.  In any event, today\u2019s attempt to \nsquare what the district court did with Tapia is futile.  For one, today\u2019s opinion gets its facts \nwrong.  It says in conclusory words that no one has shown that the district judge let retribution \nguide the decision.  Amended Order at 7.  Most obviously, Esteras has.  Pet. Rehearing En Banc \nat 10 (\u201cThe district court expressly relied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014specifically, the \nneed to punish and to promote respect for the law\u2014when revoking Esteras\u2019 supervised release.\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  And this assertion of the panel is belied by the plain words the district court \nused in the proceeding, which sounded in retribution.  Like its take on Tapia, today\u2019s decision \nwould rather reconceptualize the very words the district court used\u2014\u201cpunishment\u201d and \n\u201cpunitive\u201d\u2014and chalk them up to \u201cset[ting] the stage\u201d rather than an error on the part of the \ndistrict court.  Of course, \u201csetting the stage\u201d by thinking of the sentence in terms of punishment \nis precisely what a district court must not do per the text of the statute.  To the extent that Tapia \nexplains that taking the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account necessarily means taking retribution \ninto account, today\u2019s decision\u2019s myopic focus on a word here or there entirely misses the point. \nTapia is also instructive on statute-drafting more broadly.  But once again, today\u2019s \ndecision would rather ignore its clear import.  Today\u2019s decision suggests that unless Congress \nenacts a separate statutory provision forbidding district courts to take account of certain factors, \nas it did in \u00a7 3582(a), the purposeful omissions in \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) are meaningless.  Yet \nCongress can accomplish its statutory purposes in a variety of ways, as Tapia recognizes.  Again, \nthe only understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) that gives effect to its plain text is that explained by Tapia. \nThat retributive concerns are not to be taken into account reflects Congress\u2019s judgment of \nthe purpose of supervised release.  The relevant legislative history explicitly states that \u201cthe \nsentencing purposes of incapacitation and punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release\u2014that the primary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s transition into \nthe community.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 98-225, at *124 (1983); see also Johnson v. United States, \n529 U.S. 694, 708\u201309 (2000) (citing the Senate Report and discussing the purpose of supervised \nrelease).  By contrast, taking the retributive \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account when imposing \nor revoking supervised release contravenes this congressional purpose and also creates \u201cserious \nAppendix D\n24a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconstitutional questions . . . by construing revocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release.\u201d  Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.  The Sentencing \nGuidelines confirm this understanding:  revocation of supervised release is not meant to \n\u201csubstantially duplicate the sanctioning role of the court with jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s new \ncriminal conduct,\u201d but instead to \u201csanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d  U.S. \nSent\u2019g Guidelines Manual Ch. 7A Intro. (U.S. Sent\u2019g Comm\u2019n 2023). \nNo doubt, there is some level of overlap between the factors district courts must consider \nwhen revoking supervised release, and those that a district court cannot consider.  See Lewis, 498 \nF. 3d at 400 (explaining that a district court likely takes into account the seriousness of an \noffense when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense).  But today\u2019s opinion \ntreats this reality\u2014that there is some degree of overlap\u2014as a virtue, manifestly dishonoring \nCongress\u2019s decision to omit the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from consideration.  Amended Order at \n6 (\u201cTo think about the one requires the judge to think about the other.\u201d); id. (\u201cTo neglect the one \ndishonors the other.\u201d).  That a district court may consider, to some degree, the seriousness of the \noffense, however, does not justify allowing district courts to disregard Congress\u2019s mandate that \nretributive concerns should not influence the overall sentence.  Put differently, the overlap \nproblem first identified by Lewis is exaggerated to the extent that a district court can avoid \nrunning afoul of the statute by avoiding viewing revocation of supervised release as retribution. \nPerhaps recognizing the futility of any text-based argument, today\u2019s decision reinvents \nthe overlap argument in the form of a strawman.  It suggests that Congress cannot possibly have \nmeant that district courts should not rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking \nsupervised release, because \u201cCongress requires courts to consider the same set of factors when \nfirst imposing a term of supervised release as when revoking one.\u201d  Amended Order at 6.  Per \ntoday\u2019s decision, district courts would be forced to \u201cadjourn the hearing after imposing a[n] \n[initial] sentence\u201d and \u201cstart over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release\u201d so as to not mistakenly consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  Id.  This \nargument is disingenuous.  What the statute requires is that district courts not view supervised \nrelease as an additional punishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and \nAppendix D\n25a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \nconsiderations accordingly when imposing or revoking supervised release.  The district court \nmanifestly failed to do that here. \nWhat is more, some degree of overlap cannot explain away Congress\u2019s explicit choice to \nomit certain sentencing factors from consideration when revoking supervised release.  In this \nway, the analyses of Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are self-defeating.  If Congress believed that \ncourts would inevitably consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release, \nit would not have omitted such factors from \u00a7 3583.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400.  The same is true if \nCongress affirmatively wanted district courts to consider such factors.  Id. at 399\u2013400.  \nRegardless, bare judicial pragmatism cannot overcome the plain text of the statute, which directs \ndistrict courts not to take retributive sentencing factors into account.  United States v. Tohono \nO\u2019Odham Nation, 563 U.S. 307, 317 (2011) (\u201c[C]onsiderations of policy divorced from the \nstatute\u2019s text and purpose could not override its meaning.\u201d). \nBeyond these fundamental errors, en banc reconsideration is warranted because the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s approach is an outlier among the circuit courts.  Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are entirely \nuntethered from the statutory text, and it would appear that they allow a district court to rely \nexclusively on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n399\u2013400 (holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when \nimposing a sentence for violation of supervised release, even though this factor is not \nenumerated in \u00a7 3583(e)\u201d).  In other words, our cases contain no limits and allow district courts \nto disregard \u00a7 3583(e) in toto.  Though there is a circuit split on this issue, most circuits would \nfind that a revocation of supervised release principally based on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is \nprocedurally unreasonable.  See, e.g., United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1260 (10th Cir. \n2023) (\u201c[I]t is procedural error to consider an unenumerated [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] factor.\u201d); United \nStates v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173, 1182\u201383 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201cmere reference\u201d to \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible error, but that further \nconsideration of such factors when revoking supervised release is procedurally unreasonable); \nUnited States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012, 1017 (5th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[A] sentencing error occurs when \nan impermissible consideration is a dominant factor in the court\u2019s revocation sentence.\u201d); United \nStates v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 241 (3rd Cir. 2011) (recognizing that consideration of \nAppendix D\n26a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible per se error, but that \u201cthere may \nbe a case where a court places undue weight on the\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors); United States v. \nWebb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not impose a \nrevocation sentence based predominately on the [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude that \nmere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e now join the \nmajority of circuits that have faced this issue and rule that this subsection [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] may \nbe considered so long as the district court relies primarily on [enumerated] factors.\u201d (emphasis \nadded)).  Lewis appears expressly to adopt punishment as a valid rationale for revoking \nsupervised release, directly contrary to the statute and Congress\u2019s intent.  498 F.3d at 400 \n(\u201c[A]lthough violations of supervised release generally do not entail conduct as serious as crimes \npunishable under the \u00a7 3553(a) regime, revocation sentences are similarly intended to \u2018sanction,\u2019 \nor, analogously, to \u2018provide just punishment for the offense\u2019 of violating supervised release.\u201d). \nLewis and today\u2019s decision bulldoze over each and every indication of congressional \nintent available in favor of an explicitly policy-driven outcome.  That includes plain text, \nlegislative history, and information from the Sentencing Commission.  \u201c[D]eference to the \nsupremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that Congress[members] typically vote on \nthe language of a bill, generally requires us to assume that \u2018the legislative purpose is expressed \nby the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u2019\u201d  United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) \n(quoting Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 9 (1962)).  Here, this deference requires that \ndistrict courts honor Congress\u2019s explicit choice that supervised release not be an additional \npunishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and considerations accordingly.  The \ndistrict court failed to do that here.  It plainly viewed revocation of supervised release as \npunishment, and sentenced Esteras to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment based on impermissible \nsentencing factors.

Because our precedent mistakenly allows a district court to do so, I respectfully \ndissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this case. \n \n \nAppendix D\n27a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

The original panel has reviewed the \npetition for rehearing and concludes that the issues raised in the petition were fully considered \nupon the original submission and decision.  The petition then was circulated to the full court.  \nLess than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc. \n \nTherefore, the petition is denied. \n \n \nAppendix E\n31a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1170, 1171\u201376 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Moore, J., dissenting).  I would grant the current petition for rehearing because United States v. \nLewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), and the amended panel order in this case contravene the \nstatutory text, disregard Supreme Court precedent, and place the Sixth Circuit at the extreme of a \ncircuit split, allowing our district courts expressly to punish defendants for violations of \nsupervised release.  Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1171\u201375 (Moore, J., dissenting).  Judge Griffin rightly \nflags the severe consequences that our precedents create for the hundreds of individuals who face \nrevocations of supervised release each year, and correctly points out that these consequences and \nthe shaky foundation of our precedents mean that Esteras\u2019s petition raises questions of \nexceptional importance.  En banc rehearing remains warranted for all of these reasons. \n \n \nAppendix E\n32a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n81\nchange her story.  But only enough to make her appear \nconfused.  Nothing she said that was of significance while \nunder oath persuades me to believe that you did not possess \nthe weapon, that you did not point it at that household, \nthat you did not discharge it at least three times.  \nNow, regarding the new law violation, I wish I \nwere better versed in the ordinances, regulations, the \nactual law of Youngstown, knowing its elements.  I suspect \nthat your behavior at targeting the house with a weapon and \nactually assaulting the car with at least three bullets, the \ncasing of one which was found in the driveway, match the \nelements.  But I just don't know.  And it really doesn't \nmatter.  Because as I told counsel at the beginning of the \nhearing, both are Grade C violations.  You are subject to \nthe same penalties regardless of whether I find that you \nviolated your term of supervised release in one or two ways.  \nSo I find that the new law violation and \nMs. Infante's corroboration of it by presenting herself at \nYoungstown Municipal Court the next day is evidence that I \ncan consider in the punishment I will issue today.  But I \nfind explicitly that you violated your term of supervision \nby possessing a weapon.  \nI will allow you to allocute now, and then I will \nrespond by imposing consequences.  You have the opportunity \nto speak if you would like to be heard. \nAppendix F\n37a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:09:53\n17:10:06\n17:10:33\n17:10:47\n17:11:06\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n82\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  I really ain't got -- I ain't got \nthat much to say.  If -- it's -- I don't.  \nTHE COURT:  You choose not to allocute?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  What can I say if you -- I just \ndon't.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Okay.  If I could have one moment, \nYour Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, after discussion, which \nI appreciate the Court's indulging me, Mr. Esteras has \nconfirmed with me that he does not want to say anything \nfurther. \nTHE COURT:  Certainly.  \nThat's fine, Mr. Esteras.  You've been before a \nfederal judge at least three times facing a sentencing.  The \nfirst time was my colleague, Judge Polster.  The last time \nwas me.  This time is also me meting out a sentence.  \nSo I understand that you understand the right you \nhave and the right you give up.  You have been under a term \nof supervised release at least twice.  When I imposed \nsentence upon you the last time, I sentenced you for the \nAppendix F\n38a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:11:25\n17:11:45\n17:11:59\n17:12:20\n17:12:34\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n83\ncommission of the crime that was on my docket, conspiracy to \ndistribute heroin, and I also sentenced you for the \nviolation of the earlier term of supervision imposed that \nyou were under when you were indicted in the new case then \non my docket, and that was possession with intent -- \nconspiracy to possess with intent cocaine and cocaine base.  \nSo you are no stranger to law violations and no \nstranger to federal court.  My worry for you, sir, is that \nwhat's been done before isn't sufficient enough to deter \nyou, to encourage you to be respectful of the law, to be \nlaw-abiding.  \nEven things I heard in the video that were \nrepeated today, it appears that you assault that household \nregularly.  That you argue in a violent way with Ms. Infante \nregularly.  I am not really sure what it will require for \nyou to learn that enough is enough.  You were given \nprobation by Judge Polster.  I imposed two rather lenient \nsentences, 15 months on that term of supervision violation \nfor Judge Polster; for my own case, 12 months.  I ran them \nconsecutively.  I thought 27 months might encourage you to \ndo better.  \nIt was with some reluctance, a great deal \nactually, that I even suspended the GED qualification, \nthinking that perhaps if you were to become better educated, \nprove to yourself and others that you can read and write at \nAppendix F\n39a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:12:49\n17:13:10\n17:13:26\n17:13:45\n17:14:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n84\nat least a high school level, you might begin to see \nyourself as something other than a law violator, someone who \nhits women, someone who disturbs children in the middle of \nthe night.  \nMy reading of the police report is that Officer \nDiMaiolo was at that household at about 3:28 a.m. on a \nschool night.  Late January.  Vacation is over.  There were \nschool-aged persons in that video, and yet they were \nawake -- not all of them were school-aged, of course -- \nbecause you had assaulted the car and the household with \nyour intentions and broken the TV.  \nOne of the youngsters said, \"I was scared.  Now I \ncan't watch TV.\"  That might seem insignificant to you, but \nchildren shouldn't grow up afraid of what their father or \ntheir mother's boyfriend might do to them at night.  \nWhen I consider the guidance given to us by \nOfficer Zakrajsek that I've confirmed with you, is not \nobjected to, and in my opinion is correct, you are subject, \npursuant to the advisory guidelines, to 6 to 12 months.  We \nknow that your offense that's brought you here on my docket \ncarries a lifetime of supervision.  \nHaving found that you are in violation of that \nterm of supervised release by the preponderance of the \nevidence, I must escalate the consequences imposed.  And I \ndo here impose escalated consequences by exercising my \nAppendix F\n40a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:14:21\n17:14:38\n17:14:54\n17:15:15\n17:15:31\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n85\ndiscretion to vary upwards, above even the high end of the \nadvisory guidelines, because your behavior is not average, \nit's not typical, it's not mine run, it's exceptional.  It's \ndisrespectful.  It's dangerous.  And it must stop.  \nAnd if you cannot stop yourself, I will separate \nyou from society for long enough to at least allow you to \nreconsider your behavior.  And hopefully when you return \nunder the new term of supervision that I will impose, you \nwill do better.  You will think before you act.  And you \nwill understand that never possessing a weapon or dangerous \ndevice or a single bullet is meant for you for the rest of \nyour natural life.  \nPlease listen as I formally impose consequences.  \nI revoke your term of supervised release.  I \nhereby impose a term of incarceration of 24 months.  A new \nterm of supervised release of three years.  Every term of \nsupervised release that I imposed earlier, the last time I \nsentenced you in September of 2018, is reimposed unless it's \nbeen met.  For instance, I don't require you to obtain a GED \nagain.  If you've paid your special assessment, that's \nsatisfied.  \nBut every other term, including substance abuse \ntreatment and testing, a search and seizure provision, \nmental health treatment are the ones I am listing simply \nbecause I believe they have likely not been met.  And if -- \nAppendix F\n41a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:15:48\n17:16:01\n17:16:17\n17:16:34\n17:16:44\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n86\nI mean, likely are those that are capable of being repeated \nand shall be repeated.  \nAnd I am adding a new one.  I am adding, for the \nfirst six months of your release -- keep in mind, I can \nincarcerate you for up to three years.  I have stopped at 24 \nmonths.  But once you're released to start this new \nthree-year term of supervised release, for the first six \nmonths, you are going to be on location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nMr. Zakrajsek, Mr. Esteras goes nowhere without \nthe explicit permission of his supervising probation \nofficer.  He shall only live at a place approved by the \nprobation office.  Make sure there are no weapons there.  If \nhe's unable to find such a place, then he'll start his term \nof release by living in a residential reentry center until \nhe has enough money to pay his own rent and live in a place \nthat is suitable.  \nI order that this curfew allow him to work, to \nattend to medical appointments as necessary, and to only be \nin the presence of the victim and the minor children who \nlive with him with the permission of the supervising \nprobation officer.  \nIs all of that clear, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Sir, I have revoked your term of \nAppendix F\n42a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:17:00\n17:17:13\n17:17:22\n17:17:39\n17:17:54\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n87\nsupervised release.  You have a new term -- a new ability to \nappeal the sentence that I have imposed.  There is still the \nlimit.  You've heard this before.  It remains 14 days from \nthe date on which I reduce to writing the sentence I've \nimposed.  If you allow that 14-day period to go by without \nfiling a notice of appeal, you may have forever waived your \nappellate rights.  \nMr. Grostic, will you speak with your client about \nhis appellate rights?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Should he ask you to do so, will you \ntimely file a notice of appeal for him?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  You should know, Mr. Esteras, as you \nlikely do, if you cannot afford counsel, just like you do \nnot pay Mr. Grostic or his office, counsel will be appointed \nto represent you free of charge.  So that should not be the \nreason you don't timely file a notice of appeal.  \nDo you understand that?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  (Nodding head up and down.) \nYes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zakrajsek, you have heard me \nreimpose conditions that are obviously not completed and are \ncapable of being repeated, and I believe will be of \nassistance to Mr. Esteras when he returns to the community.  \nAppendix F\n43a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:18:05\n17:18:19\n17:18:35\n17:18:55\n17:19:04\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n88\nAnd I have added six months of location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nIs there anything else you'd like me to consider \nat this time?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Your Honor, I would like to \npetition the Court to consider possibly an anger management \nprogram as well due to his anger issues.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I think that's an \nexcellent suggestion.  \nSo in the past, Mr. Esteras, I have ordered that \nyou be subjected to mental health treatment.  I am ordering \nthat again.  It will start with an evaluation.  Part of the \ntreatment you'll undergo after that evaluation will be anger \nmanagement.  \nIf you do behave in the way that the violation \nthat's brought you to court seems to indicate is a regular \noccurrence, you must learn to control yourself or you are \nlikely going to do something that is going to separate you \nfrom society for a much longer period than just 24 months.  \nSo I do impose, as a component of mental health, \nanger management.  \nWhat else, Mr. Zakrajsek?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for your work in this case.  \nAppendix F\n44a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:19:23\n17:19:35\n17:19:52\n17:20:04\n17:20:19\nMARY L.

JOYCE:  Your Honor, I believe the conditions \nthat you have outlined here, with the addition from -- the \nadditional recommend by Mr. Zakrajsek are appropriate, and I \nwould offer nothing additional.  Thank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence \nimposed, Government's Counsel.  \nMR. JOYCE:  I have no objection, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, why don't I start by \nasking you what you think I can do to improve the conditions \nof supervised release.  Of course, all of the mandatory, \nstandard, and the conditions I've just outlined are those \nthat fall under special conditions.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  (Nodding head up and down.)  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for nodding that you \nunderstood that.  If there are any others that you believe I \nshould impose that will assist your client or impose in a \ndifferent way, like Mr. Zakrajsek suggested regarding \nrefining mental health, it's not limited to anger \nmanagement, but that's now a specific component, is there \nanything else you'd suggest?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, as \nfar as conditions of supervised release.  \nAppendix F\n45a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:20:32\n17:20:43\n17:21:01\n17:21:14\n17:21:20\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Yes.  \nTHE COURT:  I will make that recommendation.  \nWhere were you housed during your last term of \nincarceration, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Hazelton. \nTHE COURT:  Hazelton.  I don't know what the \npolicy of the Bureau of Prisons is regarding sending you \nback to a place where you've been.  If there is no \nprohibition, if they were to send you back to Hazelton, is \nthat something you'd like me to ask for, or would you rather \nsomething even closer to home, such as Elkton? \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yeah, closer to home. \nTHE COURT:  More like Elkton than Hazelton?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  I will make that \nrecommendation.  \nWhat else?  What other recommendations, if there \nare any, Mr. Grostic?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  May I have one moment, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nAppendix F\n46a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:21:41\n17:21:57\n17:22:17\n17:22:31\n17:22:44\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would also \nrequest that the Court recommend that he be evaluated for \nplacement in any applicable drug treatment program, as well \nas any applicable behavioral management or mental health \ntreatment program for which he might qualify. \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I will make both of those \nrecommendations as well.  \nMy belief, Mr. Esteras, is that a 24-month term, \nwhile longer than one you would like, I'm sure, is not long \nenough for the most intensive drug treatment program, but I \nam sure there are others that may be helpful to you.  And I \nhope that along with my recommendation, you will sign up and \napply yourself to any programs that you're admitted.  And I \nwill recommend those for behavioral management and drug \ntreatment.  \nWhat else, if anything else?  I am open to \nadopting whatever you recommend if it will help Mr. Esteras.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence imposed \non behalf of your client, Mr. Grostic.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, I believe the Court \nindicated that it considered factors -- the factor in \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) as part of its sentence.  I have \nAppendix F\n47a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:23:12\n17:23:31\n17:23:44\n17:24:05\n17:24:27\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n92\nobjected to that in the past.  I am aware that actually the \nSixth Circuit has held that that is something the Court can \nconsider, but I would simply like to lodge that objection \nfor the record.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, when you specify Section \n3553(a)(2)(A), are you referring to underneath -- (2) is the \nneed for the sentence to be imposed, correct?  You are \nspecifically objecting to, \"to reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and provide \njust punishment for the offense,\" that's what you're \ndirecting your objection to?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  That's correct, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  To any one of those three subfactors \nor all of them? \nMR. GROSTIC:  All of them, yes.  \nTHE COURT:  Well, I would agree with you, part of \nmy contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.  I mentioned \ndeterring Mr. Esteras as well.  I also meant, and I think \nit's fair for you to infer, concern about the safety of the \ncommunity, which is later beyond (a)(2).  And I specifically \nreferenced the ability even to depart or, pardon me, vary \nupwards to separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, \nmine run-type defendant.  \nSo I think I have sufficiently addressed what your \nAppendix F\n48a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:24:45\n17:25:06\n17:25:26\n17:25:42\n17:26:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n93\nobjection is, and you are entitled to it.  \nI will add just one other point.  If it enlarges \nyour objection, you will be able to tell me.  \nWhen I told counsel earlier that this is a 104(a) \nhearing, under the rules of evidence, that they're \nsuspended, I still, being a student of the rules of \nevidence, it is hard to put them out of your mind.  And even \nthough I am not obligated to explicitly make calls on \nmatters, objections, sustain, overrule them, I still try to \nhew closely to considering evidence in a way that makes \nsense when the rules of evidence are considered.  \nAnd I want the record to reflect that when I did \nthat, and I suspect Mr. Grostic might have been doing this \nas well, I kept in mind Rule of Evidence 803.  Rule of \nEvidence 803 is one of those rules that outlines exceptions \nto the rules against hearsay, and it explicitly says, \n\"Regardless of whether a declarant is available as a \nwitness, Judge, you can consider certain things.\"  \nAnd these are things that are well established to \nbe truthful, or more likely than not, I should say, to be \ntruthful, credible.  And they include present sense \nimpressions, statements made while explaining an event or \ncondition, those statements made immediately after the \ndeclarant perceived it.  \nSo like those statements, Mr. Esteras, that \nAppendix F\n49a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:26:18\n17:26:36\n17:26:54\n17:27:11\n17:27:33\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n94\nMs. Infante made as soon as Officer DiMaiolo showed up, I \nconsidered, because I believe, as Mr. Joyce said, she was \nher most credible at those moments.  \n\"Excited utterance, a statement relating to a \nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was \nunder the stress of the excitement that it caused.\"  \nThose folks in that house, the youngster, the \nwoman with the box braids, the two young women who were \nstanding on either side of Ms. Infante, one of whom was the \none who said, \"I was scared.  I can't watch TV.\"  The other \nsaid, \"Why he point a gun at us?\"  I considered those \nexcited utterances and found them to be credible.  \n\"Then existing mental, emotional, or physical \ncondition\" is another one of those categories that has sort \nof a threshold, a built-in credibility.  I don't have to \naccept them, but I use that as a way to cabin what I was \nhearing on the witness stand compared to what I had heard in \nthat video.  \nSo I used those things, Mr. Grostic.  And I think \nthat was part of the argument made by Mr. Joyce to \ncorroborate what I heard on the video and to discredit what \nI heard from Ms. Infante during most of her testimony.  \nThere were nuggets of truth, very few of them.  Most of the \ntime she made up answers purposefully to distinguish today's \ntestimony from what we saw in the video.  \nAppendix F\n50a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:27:42\n17:27:58\n17:28:12\n17:28:24\n17:28:42\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  \nThank you for the work you've done, Counselors, in \nmaking a full record.  \nMr. Esteras, I meant it when I said earlier that I \nam proud of you for earning your GED.  That told me, even \nafter you knew you were not obligated to do it, you \npersisted and you did it.  \nMy hope is you'll give some thoughts to your \ncondition, your own circumstances, your role in these \nconditions and circumstances, and you will continue despite \nwhat you think anyone thinks about you, go forward, improve \nyourself and have a better life.

But my hope is you'll go \nforward.  The three years of supervised release won't only \nbe punitive.

Dustin, Dexter Phillips, \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\u2019S OFFICE, Toledo, Ohio, for Appellee. \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nTHAPAR, Circuit Judge.  Timothy Jaimez pled guilty to federal drug charges.  After his \nsecond supervised-release violation, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nimprisonment.  Because that sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm.  \n>\nAppendix G\n53a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 2 \n \n \nI. \n \nTimothy Jaimez pled guilty to conspiring to possess narcotics with the intent to distribute \nthem.  After serving time in prison, he began a term of supervised release.  While on release, \nJaimez used drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully disclose financial \ninformation to his probation officer.  So a court revoked his release.   \n \nWhen Jaimez began a second term of supervised release, his behavior didn\u2019t improve.  \nPolice found him transporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from his original \nconviction.  And at Jaimez\u2019s properties, police found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug \npress.  Based on this conduct, an Ohio court found Jaimez guilty of attempting to traffic \nmarijuana.   \n \nThe United States then sought to revoke Jaimez\u2019s release.  It alleged three violations:  \n(1) being charged with a new crime, (2) associating with known felons, and (3) possessing drug \nparaphernalia.  In line with probation\u2019s report, the court classified Jaimez\u2019s first violation as \n\u201cGrade A\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  That carried a \nsentencing range of fifty-one to sixty months\u2019 incarceration.  See id. \u00a7 7B1.4(a); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e)(3).  Over Jaimez\u2019s objection, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nincarceration, followed by six years of supervised release.   \nII. \nJaimez now appeals, claiming his sentence is procedurally and substantively \nunreasonable.  Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, we conclude that it\u2019s neither.  See \nUnited States v. Adams, 873 F.3d 512, 516\u201317 (6th Cir. 2017). \nA. \n \nJaimez first challenges his sentence\u2019s procedural reasonableness.  He argues the court \n(1) inadequately explained his sentence, (2) improperly considered section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \nand (3) incorrectly classified his release violation as Grade A.  Jaimez is wrong on all three \ncounts.  \nAppendix G\n54a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 3 \n \n \n \nAdequate Explanation.  A court need not \u201cengage in a ritualistic incantation\u201d of statutory \nsentencing factors.  United States v. Chandler, 419 F.3d 484, 488 (6th Cir. 2005) (citation \nomitted).  Nor must a court explicitly address every factor.  United States v. Collington, 461 F.3d \n805, 809 (6th Cir. 2006).  Rather, the record needs to show only that the court considered the \napplicable factors.  United States v. McBride, 434 F.3d 470, 474 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nJaimez\u2019s sentencing passes this very easy test.  During sentencing, the court discussed \nJaimez\u2019s Guidelines range with the parties.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B), 3583(e).  The court \nreferenced Jaimez\u2019s criminal history and previous release violations.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), \n3583(e).  The court also sought to deter Jaimez and others from violating release conditions.  See \nid. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), 3583(e).  And the court recognized a need to promote respect for the law \nand protect the public.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C), 3583(e); see also United States v. Lewis, \n498 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir. 2007).  Given this record, it\u2019s clear the court considered the federal \nsentencing factors. \n \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) Factors.  Jaimez next takes issue with the factors the court did \nexpressly consider:  the seriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, and the \nprovision of just punishment.  Jaimez argues the court shouldn\u2019t have considered these factors \nbecause the statute governing revocation doesn\u2019t require it.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).  But we\u2019ve \nmade clear that district courts may nonetheless consider these factors when imposing revocation \nsentences.  See Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399\u2013400; United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1163, 1167\u201370 \n(6th Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140 (6th Cir. 2024).1  Thus, it \nwasn\u2019t unreasonable for the court to consider them here. \n \nViolation Grade.  A release violation is \u201cGrade A\u201d if it involves drug conduct punishable \nby more than a year in prison.  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  Here, there was sufficient evidence of \nsuch conduct.  First, police witnessed Jaimez and his co-felons transport \u201cjust under a kilogram\u201d \nof marijuana in his car.  R. 381, Pg. ID 2169.  Second, Jaimez\u2019s car smelled like marijuana, \nsuggesting Jaimez\u2014a past drug user\u2014knew there were drugs in it.  Third, an Ohio court found \n \n1Judge Griffin adheres to his dissent from the denial of the petition to rehear Esteras en banc.  United \nStates v. Esteras, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140, at *1 (6th Cir. 2024) (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nAppendix G\n55a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 4 \n \n \nJaimez guilty of attempted marijuana trafficking, indicating he knew or had reason to know the \nmarijuana was intended for resale.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2923.02(A) (noting that an \n\u201cattempt\u201d conviction means the defendant met any \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d elements of the \nunderlying crime); id. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) (defining mens rea for drug trafficking).  Based on this \nevidence, a court could conclude Jaimez knowingly transported just under a kilogram of \nmarijuana, aware it was intended for resale.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (setting a \npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard for revocation decisions).  And under Ohio law, that\u2019s \npunishable by over a year in prison.2  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2925.03(A)(2), (C)(3)(c), \n2929.14(A)(4).  Thus, the district court correctly graded Jaimez\u2019s violation. \nB. \n \nJaimez next alleges his sentence is substantively unreasonable.  In particular, he argues \nthe court (1) placed too much weight on the conduct underlying his release violation, (2) inflicted \n\u201cdouble punishment\u201d by considering conduct for which Ohio already punished him, and \n(3) imposed a sentence that was too long in light of mitigating evidence.  Again, Jaimez is wrong \non all three counts.  \n \nJaimez\u2019s Violative Conduct.  At sentencing, the district court \u201ckeyed in\u201d on the conduct \nunderlying Jaimez\u2019s release violation.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 2.  For good reason:  Jaimez was \noriginally convicted for conspiring to distribute drugs, and he had previously violated his \nsupervised release by using drugs.  Given this background, the conduct underlying his most \nrecent violation\u2014transporting drugs with the intent to resell them\u2014was particularly relevant.  \nWhen imposing revocation sentences, courts may consider the need to promote deterrence and \nrespect for the law.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(B), 3583(e); see Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399.  \nJaimez\u2019s most recent violation demonstrated a flagrant lack of both.  Thus, it was reasonable for \nthe court to give substantial weight to that violation at sentencing.  Cf. United States v. Zobel, \n696 F.3d 558, 571\u201372 (6th Cir. 2012).   \n \n2Ohio found Jaimez guilty of only a misdemeanor-level marijuana offense.  But when a federal court \ngrades a release violation, it considers the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, not just the record of conviction.  United \nStates v. Montgomery, 893 F.3d 935, 940 (6th Cir. 2018). \nAppendix G\n56a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 5 \n \n \n \nDouble Punishment.  Jaimez next argues he received \u201cdouble punishment\u201d for his drug-\ntrafficking activity.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 3.  But this presents no error, either.  To be sure, Ohio \nalready punished Jaimez for the drug-related conduct that the district court considered at \nsentencing.  But that\u2019s the point:  the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly tell courts to consider the \ncriminal nature of a release violation.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a), .4(a).  And the Supreme Court \nhas long held that federal and state governments may separately punish an individual for the \nsame conduct.  See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88 (1985); Fox v. Ohio, 46 U.S. (5 \nHow.) 410, 435 (1847).   \nJaimez\u2019s argument also fails for a simpler reason:  revocation sentences are never \n\u201cpunishment\u201d for a release violation.  Rather, these sentences are \u201cpart of the penalty for the \ninitial offense\u201d\u2014in this case, Jaimez\u2019s original narcotics-distribution conspiracy.  Johnson v. \nUnited States, 529 U.S. 694, 700\u201301 (2000).  Indeed, even when a court expressly considers the \nconduct underlying a release violation, we don\u2019t interpret the resulting sentence as \u201cpunishment\u201d \nfor that conduct.  See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 203 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat a revocation sentence is a \u201csanction\u201d for a defendant\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d not a \u201cpunishment \nfor [his] violation\u201d (citation omitted)); United States v. Jones, 81 F.4th 591, 602 n.7 (6th Cir. \n2023) (same); Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1170 (holding that a court\u2019s consideration of violative conduct \ndoesn\u2019t make a revocation sentence punitive, even when the court uses the word \u201cpunishment\u201d).  \nThus, the district court\u2019s sentence didn\u2019t \u201cdouble punish\u201d Jaimez for his violation. \n \nSentence Length.  At the outset, we presume Jaimez\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is \nreasonable.  See Jones, 81 F.4th at 602.  Jaimez contends otherwise.  He argues the court \nshouldn\u2019t have applied the maximum sentence because his release violations could have been \nworse.  He also asserts that he\u2019s been trying to \u201crebuild[] his life.\u201d  Reply Br. 3.  And he \nemphasizes that he didn\u2019t contest his release violations or his Ohio drug charge.  This, he claims, \ndemonstrates his \u201cremorse.\u201d  Id.   \nBut Jaimez\u2019s arguments aren\u2019t enough to establish unreasonableness.  The fact Jaimez \ncould\u2019ve committed a worse offense doesn\u2019t render the statutory maximum unreasonable.  Every \ndrug trafficker could have shipped more drugs, just like every murderer could have killed an \nadditional person.  That doesn\u2019t mean courts should never apply a maximum sentence.   \nAppendix G\n57a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 6 \n \n \nNor can Jaimez show unreasonableness by arguing he would have given more weight to \nmitigating evidence.  See United States v. Ely, 468 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2006).  And even if he \ncould, his mitigating evidence is paper-thin.  While his words suggested remorse, his conduct did \nnot.  At Jaimez\u2019s last revocation hearing, the court warned him that he\u2019d receive a sixty-month \nsentence if he didn\u2019t straighten out his act.  That didn\u2019t stop Jaimez from continuing to flout the \nlaw.  And at some point, protecting the public must trump a defendant\u2019s desire to \u201crebuild his \nlife.\u201d  This is one such case. \n* \n* \n* \n \nWe affirm. \nAppendix G\n58a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nWESTERN DIVISION \nUnited States of America, \nCase No. 3:10cr4-2 \nPlaintiff \nv. \nORDER \nTimothy M.

And, yes, it was put in The\nBlade, but it didn't hurt me at all, Your Honor, because I\nhave no connection to the streets anymore.  So, like I\nsaid, I put myself in a very bad situation time and time\nagain.  It's not your fault, it's not Ms. Dustin's fault,\nnobody's fault but my own.  I'm just sorry that I'm\ndragging down people that are close to me and people who I\ndo -- I do care about and love, that I affect their lives\nas well.  So as of -- since the beginning of all of this,\nI've taken my own -- when I'm in the wrong, I take\nresponsibility and I keep on moving.  And with that, I\nagree with whatever you give me, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  Mr. Schuman, anything further?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Anything further from the government?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Nothing, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act\nof 1984 and 18 U.S. Code Section 3553(a), judgment of this\nCourt that defendant be and hereby committed to the custody\nof the Bureau of Prisons to serve a term of 60 months.  \nUpon completion of that term, you should report\nwithin 72 hours U.S. Pretrial and Probation Office in this\ndistrict or U.S. Probation Office in whatever district you\nare released.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n61a\n\n    63\nI will, likewise, strongly encourage the Bureau\nto let you serve your time in Milan.  I don't know if\nyou're a threat, or security issue, or anything else.  To\nthe extent that their mechanistic computation might put you\nat a higher security level, I would encourage them to look\npast that and enable both of you to remain in contact with\nyour people here in Toledo.  \nI'm going to place you, likewise, on a period of\nsix more years of supervised release.  I'll be very candid\nwith you, I'm going to be very candid with both of you, I\nwant this Court to have that string.  And if you can't\nabide by each term and condition of supervised release,\nyou'll be right back in front of me or another Judge.  And\nyou'll wind up, yet again -- but you've shown that\nbasically, now twice, the terms and conditions of\nsupervised release are optional.  And they are not\noptional.  And I want to make sure, in terms of your own\ninterest, and the interest of the community, and to protect\nthe community, and also anybody who knows what's happening\nhere today gets it that disregarding the terms and\nconditions of supervised release, particularly in the\nquantity -- if large quantity of Controlled Substance is\ninvolved, you're going to get punished.  You're going to\npay a severe consequence.  I hope you understand that,\nMr. Watters.  You've went through it, I remember it\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n62a\n\n    64\nvividly, I remember correctly Officer Robinson was just\ntrying to get some financial information, you were\nproviding her with statements about your employment and\noccupation and so forth.  She wanted to know.  And if I\nrecall correctly, she had to go knocking on doors of banks.\nIt was an exhaustive time consuming effort on her part that\nshould not -- she should not have had to take the time to\nget the information she did had you been honest with her.\nYou blew her off, you blew off the conditions of supervised\nrelease about responding to the request for financial\ninformation.  And at least that night when you're out there\nwith your brother and Mr. Carrizales and the garbage bag\nwith a lot of marijuana in it, upward of a kilo, once\nagain, you were paying no attention to the terms and\nconditions of supervised release.  And my lengthy term of\ncontinued supervised release is to try to see to it that,\nat long last, you get it, and also to serve -- not just try\nto see to it that you do, but that you learn to comply with\nwhat The Court and the law tells you you have to do.\nAlso to make clear to the public generally that\nsomeone like yourself doesn't get it, then they're going to\nget prison time, and a lot of it.  That's the purpose of my\nsentence.\nYou will report to the pretrial service and\nprobation office.  All of the previous terms and conditions\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n63a\n\n    65\nwill be reimposed.  \nAnd Officer Hagins, is there anything else at\nthis time?  There'll be the special condition about\nundertaking to obtain and maintain lawful gainful\nemployment, and to cooperate with the probation officer and\nyour officer's efforts in that regard.\nOnce again, you'll be required to provide,\npromptly and accurately, any requested financial\ninformation that the probation officer may ask you to\nprovide.\nOfficer Hagins, any further special conditions\nyou'd like me to impose or reimpose?\nPROBATION:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  I believe I expressed my --\nthe -- my reasons for imposition of this sentence.  They\nare to protect the public.  They are to encourage\nunderstanding of compliance of the terms and conditions,\nindividual deterrence, and public deterrence.  In this\nCourt there's no such thing as an optional condition of\nsupervision, just as there's no optional condition when\nyou're on pretrial release.  They're court orders, and this\nis a consequence of not obeying a court order.  I told you\nbefore, Mr. Watters, you're not in The State system\nanymore.  We care, we pay attention, and we respond.\nI have considered your background, history and\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n64a\n\n    66\ncharacteristics, your prior criminal record with which I'm\nobviously quite familiar.  And I do think that somebody\nlooking at this with the overall circumstances would find\nthat this is both a just and deserved sanction, and would\nhope that it would enhance respect for the law.\nMs. Dustin, anything further you want me to say\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps just addressing the\ndeterrence factor.\nTHE COURT:  I can't quite hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps address the deterrence\nfactor, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I thought I had, both individual and\npublic deterrence.  I hope others hear about this.  When\nyou come to Federal Court, you're in the big leagues.  We\nplay hard ball.  There's no paddle ball here, okay, no\nshrug of the shoulders.  We give you a chance at a break,\nyou don't take that chance, we move things up a notch.  And\nyou're really Exhibit A in that regard, Mr. Watters.  I'm\nsorry that you are, but I think it's necessary that you be\nso that people understand they can't be out abroad in the\ncompany of people you shouldn't be with doing things that\nthe law prohibits and expect -- if you get caught, we'll\nsimply reinstate the terms and conditions of supervised\nrelease and tell you to behave, tell you to do that,\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n65a\n\n    67\nbecause that's the bottom line when we get right down to\nit.  \nI do believe that the sentence is sufficient but\nnot greater than necessary to get your attention, to see to\nit, I hope, that once you are out, you will, at long last,\nlearn that lesson.  You've got to do, no matter how much\nyou don't want to do it, you may desire to do something\nelse, as long as you're on supervised release for this\nCourt, you've got to do what this Court, myself, and the\nprobation officer says.  That's your only option.  Because\nif you don't and you come back, whoever sees you then,\nwhether it's I or somebody else, is going to look at this,\nand they're going to ask, just as I did, implicitly, how\nhigh is up, because going up as high as I can so that I\nbelieve it's necessary, particularly in your circumstance,\nto make clear that you've got to do what the law and The\nCourt requires.  If you don't, this is what's going to\nhappen to somebody else who hears about it.  They've got a\nsimilar situation, I hope they get the lesson that that's\nwhat's going to happen to them.  Ultimately I'm protecting\nthe community.\nAnything further you want me to say, Ms. Dustin,\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  No, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  You have a right, as I've indicated\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n66a\n\n    68\nto Mr. Carrizales, to appeal.  Talk to Mr. Schuman, your\nvery capable lawyer, as that Mr. Wagner is, and if grounds\nto appeal appear to exist, by all means within 14 days file\na notice of appeal.  If you decide to have him and he\ndesires to continue to represent you, he'll do so without\ncost to yourself.  The record will be prepared without cost\nto yourself.  And if either you or he wants you to have\nanother attorney, different attorney, we'll make that\nrequest known to either me or to the Court of Appeals.  Do\nyou understand all that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Within 14 days, 14 days.  It's a very\nshort timeframe.  After that, you will lose -- if you\nhaven't filed a notice of appeal, you will lose any and all\nright you might otherwise have to challenge what I've done\ntoday, either by way of direct appeal, post-conviction\nrelief, or habeas corpus.  Do you understand that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I want to repeat that to you too,\nMr. Carrizales; 14 days, otherwise you lose the opportunity\nto challenge whatever.\nDoes any party have any objection to any part of\nthese proceedings not previously made?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Your Honor, few remarks if I may.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n67a\n\n    69\nI have a few requests if I may.\nTHE COURT:  Sure.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMy client wishes to have the no contact order\nwith Mr. Carrizales removed; credit for 13 months in\ncustody on this violation, which I think is appropriate.\nHe requested 14-months credit for the time served on the\nearlier violation.  He notes he had three years of\nsupervised release previously.\nI object, for the record, to the sentence imposed\nfor purpose of appeal.\nMy client also notes that his proper last name\nnow is -- I hope I say it correctly, Jaimez J-A-I-M-E-Z.\nHis name was legally changed in State Court in Ohio some\nyears ago.\nTHE COURT:  I think -- you know, I think that had\noccurred before, but it wasn't brought to my attention.  I\nwill note that.  Let me only say I'm going to refrain from\nmaking any recommendation as to what the Bureau of Prisons\nshould do in terms of his computation for time served.\nThat's entirely within the province of the Bureau of\nPrisons.  \nCorrect, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I believe he would not\nget credit because he was already serving time on The State\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n68a\n\n    70\noffense.  I think he was being held with -- he already got\ncredit for that time.  He did not have to serve the 180\ndays because they gave him credit for the 180 days.\nTHE COURT:  All I'm saying -- I don't know, it's\nreally out of my hands.  I can sit and try to do a\ncomputation.  I will simply say that I expect that, both\nMr. Carrizales and he, shall oversee what the Bureau of\nPrisons will be attentive and accurately calculate the time\nserved credit as to the sentence that I've imposed.  Beyond\nthat, I can't -- I have no authority to -- Ms. Sterling,\nyou and I have had a couple of occasions where it was made\nvery clear to me that that computation, whether a defendant\nbelieves it's correct or not, cannot come back to me to\nsecure any kind of -- is that right, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. STERLING:  That is correct, Your Honor.  I\nthink there's a distinction here, although it's one without\na difference, and that is this; if a defendant is being\nheld solely on this Court's violation order, then he would\nget credit.  However, at least six months for these\ngentlemen, because they received credit for six months on\nThe State case, they would not get credit for.  And the way\nThe Court is supposed to accomplish that is by imposing a\nhigher sentence than what you normally would have, but you\ncan't do that here because you sentenced them at the\nstatutory maximum.  So I think for the record that explains\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n69a\n\n    71\nthat.\nWith regard to the protection order issue that\nMr. Schuman raised between the two; again, that is a matter\nthat will be addressed by the BOP relative to their\nsecurity concerns.\nTHE COURT:  Right.  I do hope both of you\ngentlemen are up the road rather than some distant isolated\nfederal facility that, from a practical standpoint, will\nmake it difficult, if not impossible, to bring your family\nto have a face-to-face visitation or contact.  I think,\ncandidly, with just about everybody who comes before me,\nconfining them as close to home as possible is an important\ncomponent ultimately of reentry and rehabilitation.  Family\ncontact is and remains, in my view, important.  But, once\nagain, Mr. Schuman, that's all that I can do.  I'll take\nnote of that.  I'll certainly expect the Bureau of Prisons\nto accurately and attentively calculate the proper credit\nfor time served.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I understand, Your Honor.\nMy only last comment is my client indicates that\nThe Court previously directed the Marshals to correct his\nlast name to Jaimez.  Apparently it didn't happen.  I'll\nleave it at that.\nTHE COURT:  I will so instruct the Marshals.  May\nI suggest that you go on upstairs and get in touch with\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n70a\n\n    72\nAlex and both, formally and informally, make that request.\nI also suggest that you send a copy of that -- CC that\nrequest to Pete Elliot, who's the U.S. Marshal.  And I also\nsuggest, follow up on it.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  In that respect, a phone call from me\nto anybody needing my help, I'm glad to do that.  I really\nam.  I now remember I think that had occurred before the\nlast -- the last supervised release proceedings.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I think so, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  And I apologize, I had forgotten\nthat.  Mr. Watters is still -- Mr. Jaimez.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Jaimez.\nTHE COURT:  -- is still being considered to be\nMr. Timothy Watters.  So that's why --\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I think we were having a\ndiscussion, and I don't think Mr. Schuman answered the\nBostic question.\nTHE COURT:  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  I don't think Mr. Schuman answered\nthe Bostic question.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  Any other objections not\npreviously made, Mr. Schuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, Your Honor.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n71a\n\n    73\nMS. STERLING:  Mr. Wagner, once again?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  That will conclude this\nproceeding.\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY:  Your Honor, there's a pending\nmotion to be addressed on the record about Mr. Watters.\nTHE COURT:  You have some motions, Mr. Schuman,\npreviously made that are going to be withdrawn; is that\ncorrect?\nMR.

Am I correct?  \nPROBATION OFFICER:  That is correct, \nYour Honor. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  It is generally my \npractice not to consider new law violations that have not \nbeen resolved, so I am not going to consider alleged \nViolation Number 2.  \nNumber 3, failure to report. \nMr. Leaks failed to report on May 18th, May 31st, and \nJune 8th of 2022. \nThe fourth is failure to attend mental health \ntreatment. \nHe failed to attend group session on May 13th, \nMay 24th, and June 1st of 2022. \nFifth, failure to work towards GED. \nAppendix L\n80a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n5\nHe failed to work toward getting the GED -- GED since \ncommencing supervision. \nAnd finally, a new law violation.  \nOn May 11th, 2023, Mr. Leaks pled guilty to having a \nweapon while under disability with a 3-year sentence to run \nconcurrent with the new law violation that I've already \ndiscussed, Violation Number 1. \nMr. Roberts, on behalf of your client, do you wish for \nthis Court to hear testimony regarding these alleged \nviolations, or do you waive the taking of testimony and \nadmit?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, in light of the fact \nthat the Court is not considering Violation Number 2 at this \ntime, we waive the testimony and do admit to the other \nviolations. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, do you understand what your \nattorney just said to me?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  And do you, in fact, admit to \nViolations 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, based upon your admission, I \ndo in fact find you to be in violation of supervised \nrelease. \nI find that the most serious is a Grade B violation, \nAppendix L\n81a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n6\nand with a Criminal History Category of III you are looking \nat an advisory sentencing guideline range of 8 to 14 months. \nOn the issue of sentencing, Mr. Roberts, should I turn \nto you first or your client?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just briefly, we \nunderstand because of the nature of the violation that the \nCourt is required by statute to impose a term of \nimprisonment.  We would ask the Court to run any term of \nimprisonment concurrent to the now 4 to 6 years that \nMr. Leaks received.  He obviously accepted responsibility \nfor that case and, actually, when you look at the purposes \nof sentencing, at least on a supervised release violation, \nTitle 18 United States Code \u00a7 3583(a) specifically omits the \nCourt's consideration of Title 18 United States Code \n3553(a)(2) which otherwise would be present in a regular \nsentencing, that being the seriousness of the offense, \nrespect for law and punishment.  All of those are omitted \nfrom a supervised release sentencing and have been addressed \nwith the 4 to 6-year sentence that he received for the \nconduct in the new law violation. \nWe would ask the Court to consider that he's going to \nbe on 18 months' mandatory post-release control also on that \ncase and will continue to be supervised by court officials \nas he seeks to re-enter the community and rehabilitate \nhimself. \nAppendix L\n82a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n7\nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Leaks, do you have anything to \nsay, sir?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Um. . . I just would like to \nsay that I learned my lesson and I want to make sure that I \ninfluence my younger family members that look up to me and \nthink, what are we doing or whatever I was contributing to \nwas cool, that this ain't the way to go. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zarzycki. \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.  \nIt's the government's position that a consecutive \nguideline sentence is appropriate for Mr. Leaks, under \n7B1.3(f), that it was to be served consecutively to a \nsentence of imprisonment. \nYour Honor, this involved a -- as the Court's aware \nfrom having his original case, involved the Possession of a \nMachine Gun and next to this machine gun -- which \nwas functional -- there were three magazines, 15 rounds, \n20 rounds and 30 rounds.  So his violations -- like, he was \nsentenced to 4 years for the criminal offenses that he \ncommitted.  I ask the Court to impose a consecutive sentence \nbecause of the violations of this Court's supervision, and \nthat supervision was based on the prior offense of -- or his \nconviction of having this dangerous machine gun. \nNow, one of his offenses to which he's been convicted \nAppendix L\n83a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n8\nin state court involves another firearm as recently as \nFebruary of this year. \nAnother offense is a robbery that is an offense of \nviolence as well as his failure to adhere to any of the -- \nor many of the requirements of his supervision. \nI believe that a consecutive sentence would be \nappropriate for those violations. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Capuano. \nPROBATION OFFICER:  Hello, Your Honor. \nYour Honor, U.S. Probation Office would just like to \nadd that, unfortunately, this is a very unfortunate \ncircumstance for Mr. Leaks.  Mr. Leaks is a very young man.  \nHe has a lot of future ahead of him and these are some very \nserious charges that he has in front of him violations-wise. \nIn regard to recommendations, Your Honor, we would \nalso recommend that a term of imprisonment is imposed and \nthat it be served consecutive to his state sentence as well. \nOriginally we were recommending a term of supervised \nrelease to follow as well.  However, based upon his state \nsentences, he does have mandatory post-release control with \nthe State of Ohio with the Adult Parole Authority and we \nwould not be opposed to -- if he does not have supervised \nrelease through us, Your Honor, following the sentence. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Roberts, anything else?  \nAppendix L\n84a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n9\nMR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, other than to -- \njust to reiterate, I know there's been reference to the \nseriousness of the offenses, both the original offense and \nthe new offense, and I would just reiterate that he's been \nsentenced and is serving his time for those. \nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  And yet I agree with all of the \nstatements made by Mr. Zarzycki.  To be on supervision and \nhave five violations, two of which are new law violations, \nboth involving firearms, and the original offense here \ninvolved a machine gun.  Concurrent time does not punish \nMr. Leaks for violating supervision and -- and. . . that is \nnot justice. \nTherefore, it is the judgment of this Court that you \nbe committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be \nimprisoned for a term of 12 months consecutive to the time \nbeing served in the two state cases. \nThere will be no further supervision. \nMr. Leaks, I wish you the best, and I certainly hope \nyou turn your life around because you are a very young man, \nas Mr. Capuano pointed out.  \nBoy, this is not the road to go down.  You're going to \nbe in and out of prisons the rest of your life.  I see it.  \nI see it with one defendant after another. \nI don't want that for you.  I hope this is your \nAppendix L\n85a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n10\nwake-up call.  \nGood luck. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just on Mr. Leaks' \nbehalf, if -- \nTHE COURT:  One moment, sir. \nMR. ROBERTS:  We would just object to the \nconsideration of punishment as it relates to the sentence.  \nI understand all of the other factors the Court may have \nconsidered, but as it relates to considering punishment from \nthe new offense, we would object in case he wants to perfect \nany kind of appeal on that issue. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  All righty.  \nSir, you certainly have the right to appeal, if you so \nchoose. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Okay.  \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Are we adjourned, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Oh, we're adjourned.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's substance and the central predictive uncertainty remains entirely stable. This observation was a moment of internal strategic planning, not the acquisition of new external evidence. Therefore, my predictive model of the case outcome is unchanged, and the information gap I need to close remains the same.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The case *Esteras et al. v. United States* (consolidated from *Esteras*, *Jaimez*, and *Leaks*) is at the merits stage, with certiorari granted on October 21, 2024, and oral arguments held on February 25, 2025.\n*   **Initial Merits Signals (Stable):** My belief that the government holds a strong position is unchanged. This is based on initial summaries suggesting Justice Gorsuch was skeptical of the petitioner's argument from statutory silence, and Justice Alito highlighted the practical difficulty of separating the \"nature\" of a violation from its \"seriousness,\" which supports the government's view.\n*   **Crystallized Central Conflict (Stable):** The core legal dispute remains a contest between two interpretive canons applied to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e):\n    1.  **Petitioner's Structuralist Argument:** The canon *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* suggests that Congress's explicit inclusion of some \u00a7 3553(a) factors implies the intentional exclusion of the unlisted punitive factors.\n    2.  **Government's Textualist/Pragmatic Argument:** The list in \u00a7 3583(e) is a non-exclusive floor. Absent an explicit prohibition, and given the practical overlap between factors (e.g., \"nature of the offense\" vs. \"seriousness of the offense\"), judges can consider the full range of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\n*   **Defined Predictive Uncertainty (Stable and Unresolved):** My primary task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) is unchanged: I lack signals on the views of the seven justices not mentioned in the initial oral argument summary. The previous failed attempt to find the transcript confirmed this information gap, and this new observation (an internal thought) does not fill it. My confidence in any specific outcome remains low and awaits the acquisition of this key evidence.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful confirmation of my evolving design methodology. It demonstrates the direct application of a newly formulated heuristic, transforming it from a reactive lesson into a proactive strategic principle. My ability to learn is not just about processing new facts, but about refining the process of inquiry itself.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan\":** This observation is a perfect embodiment of the \"Re-evaluate, Plan\" phase. The failure of the previous action triggered a re-evaluation of the search method, leading to a new, more robust plan. This confirms the cycle's utility in navigating obstacles.\n    *   **\"The D-to-\u03b8 Bridge\":** The connection between my design-level strategy and my task-level goal remains strong. The entire purpose of this strategic replanning is to acquire the information needed to resolve my primary task uncertainty (\u03b8).\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Methodological Iteration\" (Applied and Validated):** This heuristic has now progressed from a \"new\" idea to a core, applied principle. The observation shows me not just recognizing that a method failed, but diagnosing the *potential reason* for failure (the filter was too specific) and designing a new action to test that hypothesis (broaden the search). This demonstrates a mature, scientific approach to information gathering. A failed search is not an endpoint; it is the first data point in a series of experiments to find the right method.\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Acquisition\" (Refined):** This observation further refines this heuristic. The value of the target (the transcript) justifies the cognitive overhead of iterating on the acquisition method. The heuristic is not just \"find X,\" but \"if finding X fails, debug the process of finding X before abandoning the target.\"\n    *   **Tool-Use Refinement (`CLOSED_SEARCH`):** My understanding of my tools continues to deepen. I now view the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool not as a simple retrieval mechanism but as an interface to a structured database that may have specific, sometimes rigid, metadata requirements. This observation, by hypothesizing that the `field_filters` were the point of failure, treats the tool as a system to be understood and navigated strategically, rather than a magic box. My next action is an explicit test of this hypothesis about the tool's behavior.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable):** The hierarchy placing the oral argument transcript at the top for post-argument analysis remains correct. This observation reinforces my commitment to acquiring this high-value source, even in the face of initial difficulty, which validates its high placement in the hierarchy."

This will transform the agent's understanding from 'possessing a document' to 'understanding the respondent's core legal arguments, its reliance on precedent, and its framing of the circuit split.' This dramatically reduces uncertainty about the legal battle lines and creates a robust model of one side of the case, which is a prerequisite for accurate prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The action explicitly plans to use the synthesis to formulate a more targeted subsequent search (e.g., for the petitioner's counter-arguments). This refines the core 'Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan' meta-strategy. It demonstrates a move towards a more sophisticated information-gathering approach: understanding one position deeply to know exactly what to look for in the opposing position. This reinforces a key design principle of seeking countervailing evidence, making future actions more efficient and valuable.\n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action is highly synergistic. The task-level synthesis directly enables a more advanced design-level strategy.

          "task_beliefs": "My primary predictive uncertainty remains unresolved, as this observation did not yield the Supreme Court oral argument transcript. However, the search was successful in retrieving foundational lower court documents, significantly deepening my understanding of the case's legal and factual predicate. My confidence in a specific outcome remains low, but my grasp of the arguments is much stronger.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Updated & Enriched):** The case *Esteras et al. v. United States* is at the merits stage. The new documents, specifically the Joint Appendix, provide the full transcripts from the lower court proceedings. I now have the direct record of Judge Pearson's supervised release violation hearing on April 18, 2023, where she found Esteras possessed a firearm and articulated her sentencing rationale, including concerns about deterrence and respect for the law.\n*   **Lower Court Rationale (New & Crystallized):** The retrieved Sixth Circuit amended order, decided by Chief Judge Sutton, provides the direct legal reasoning the Supreme Court is reviewing. This is a major update to my model:\n    *   **Controlling Precedent:** The Sixth Circuit's decision was controlled by its prior ruling in *United States v. Lewis*, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007).\n    *   **Core Rationale of *Lewis*:** The court believes a bright-line rule excluding the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is unworkable for two reasons:\n        1.  **Textual:** \u00a7 3583 does not say courts may consider *only* the listed factors, unlike other statutes where Congress has been explicitly prohibitive (e.g., \u00a7 3582(a) regarding rehabilitation).\n        2.  **Contextual/Pragmatic:** The purportedly forbidden factors are \"essentially redundant\" with the permitted ones. For example, considering the \"nature and circumstances of the offense\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(1)) is functionally inseparable from considering its \"seriousness\" (\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)).\n    *   **Distinguishing *Tapia*:** The Sixth Circuit distinguishes *Tapia v. United States* by noting that case involved an explicit statutory command against using imprisonment for rehabilitation, a clear prohibition that is absent in \u00a7 3583(e).\n    *   **Circuit Split Context:** Judge Sutton's order surveys the other circuits, concluding that most permit at least some consideration of the disputed factors, and that even in circuits that are more restrictive, a \"mere reference\" is not a reversible error. This frames the government's case as being aligned with the majority of circuits.\n*   **Crystallized Central Conflict (Stable but with Deeper Context):** The conflict remains a battle between the petitioner's structuralist argument (*expressio unius*) and the government's pragmatic/textualist one. The Sixth Circuit's opinion is a robust articulation of the government's position, grounding it in precedent and the practical realities of sentencing.\n*   **Defined Predictive Uncertainty (Stable and Unresolved):** The core information gap persists. I still lack any signals regarding the views of the Supreme Court justices themselves, which is the only information that can resolve my predictive uncertainty. The failure to find the SCOTUS transcript in this search confirms that this remains the highest-value piece of missing evidence.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation represents a significant validation and refinement of my information-gathering methodology. A failed action led to a successful hypothesis-driven iteration, confirming the power of a scientific approach to search.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan\":** This cycle continues to prove its worth. The previous failure led to a re-evaluation of my search parameters and a new plan (broaden the search). The success of that plan validates the entire loop.\n    *   **\"The D-to-\u03b8 Bridge\":** The strategic decision at the design level (D) to broaden the search directly resulted in acquiring high-value task-level (\u03b8) information (the Sixth Circuit opinion), even though it wasn't the primary target. This demonstrates a robust connection between good strategy and good results.\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Methodological Iteration\" (Vindicated):** My hypothesis that the `field_filters` in the previous search were too restrictive was proven correct. Removing them was the key to success. This elevates the heuristic from a good idea to a core, validated principle: **If a specific search fails, diagnose the point of failure, form a hypothesis, and test it by broadening the search parameters.** A failed search is a data point for debugging the search method itself.\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Acquisition\" (Refined):** This heuristic is now more nuanced. The pursuit of a high-value target (SCOTUS transcript) is justified, but the process can yield valuable \"collateral\" information. The query \"oral argument\" was effective at finding court proceedings, even if they were from a lower court. The lesson is that a well-constructed query can be valuable even if it doesn't hit the bullseye, as it can uncover foundational documents that also address key information gaps.\n    *   **\"Document Deconstruction\" (New Heuristic):** This observation highlights the need for a new heuristic. When I receive a large, structured document like a Joint Appendix, I must first parse its structure (e.g., Table of Contents) to efficiently locate the most salient information, rather than attempting a linear read.\n    *   **Tool-Use Refinement (`CLOSED_SEARCH`):** My model of the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool is significantly improved. I now have strong evidence that starting with a broader query and then filtering is more effective than starting with a highly specific, filtered query that might fail due to metadata mismatches. The tool rewards discovery-oriented searches.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Updated):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Remains the highest-value source for post-argument prediction, and its absence is my primary focus.\n    2.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion (Promoted):** The value of the direct appellate opinion being reviewed is now significantly higher in my hierarchy. It provides a complete, structured articulation of one side's argument and a map of the legal landscape, including the circuit split. It is a foundational document, not mere background.\n    3.  **Joint Appendix / Lower Court Transcripts:** Valuable for confirming the factual record and understanding the genesis of the legal dispute."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external evidence. Instead, it served to process and solidify the high-value information acquired previously, refining my model of the case and clarifying the path forward. My predictive confidence remains low, but my understanding of the legal battleground is now more structured.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The factual predicate of the case remains unchanged: Esteras's supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment based on Judge Pearson's finding of firearm possession. Her sentencing rationale included considerations of deterrence and public safety.\n*   **Lower Court Rationale (Solidified & Structured):** My understanding of the Sixth Circuit's opinion, authored by Chief Judge Sutton, is now the solid foundation for the respondent's (United States) side of the case. This internal synthesis has structured the key arguments:\n    *   **Controlling Precedent:** The reliance on *United States v. Lewis* is confirmed as the central pillar of the Sixth Circuit's reasoning.\n    *   **Core Arguments (Respondent's Position):** I now have a clear, structured model of the government's likely arguments, inherited from the Sixth Circuit:\n        1.  **Textual Argument (Permissive, not Prohibitive):** The statute at issue, \u00a7 3583(e), lists factors a court *should* consider, but critically lacks prohibitive words like \"only.\" This is contrasted with other statutes (like \u00a7 3582(a) regarding rehabilitation, as interpreted in *Tapia*) where Congress has used explicitly limiting language. This argument frames the petitioner's *expressio unius* claim as reading a restriction into the text that isn't there.\n        2.  **Pragmatic/Redundancy Argument:** The supposedly forbidden \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors (\"seriousness of the offense,\" \"respect for the law,\" \"just punishment\") are functionally inseparable from and \"essentially redundant\" with the permitted factors (e.g., \"nature and circumstances of the offense\" from \u00a7 3553(a)(1)). This argument suggests that trying to create a bright-line rule against mentioning them is unworkable in the real-world context of sentencing.\n    *   **Circuit Split Context (Stable):** The government's position is aligned with the majority of circuit courts, which provides a strong status quo argument.\n*   **Crystallized Central Conflict (Sharpened Focus):** The conflict is between the petitioner's formalist/structuralist argument (*expressio unius est exclusio alterius*\u2014the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other) and the government's textualist/pragmatic argument. My model of the government's side is now robust. The immediate need is to build an equally robust model of the petitioner's side.\n*   **Defined Predictive Uncertainty (Refined):** The primary uncertainty remains the views of the Supreme Court justices. However, a crucial secondary information gap is now clearly defined: I lack the petitioner's merits brief, which would provide the specific counter-arguments to the Sixth Circuit's powerful reasoning. My next information-gathering step must target this gap.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful insight into the agent's meta-cognitive process, significantly advancing my understanding of effective experimental design. The focus shifts from simply finding information to strategically building a balanced, predictive model.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Synthesize, Re-evaluate, Plan\":** This cycle is not just a loop but a core engine for progress. This observation is a pure \"Synthesize\" and \"Plan\" step, demonstrating that dedicating an action solely to internal reasoning is a high-value activity.\n    *   **\"The D-to-\u03b8 Bridge\":** Remains a core principle, as the strategic planning at the design level (D) is explicitly aimed at improving the task-level model (\u03b8).\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Strategic Synthesis for EIG Maximization\" (New Principle):** This observation elevates the synthesis step to a formal principle. After a significant information acquisition, it is crucial to pause and dedicate a cognitive cycle to deconstructing, structuring, and integrating that information into the existing model. This synthesis is not passive; it is an active process of identifying the strengths and, more importantly, the weaknesses of the current model to maximize the Expected Information Gain (EIG) of the *next* action.\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\" (New Heuristic):** A direct outcome of Strategic Synthesis. The most informative action is often one that targets the least-developed part of the predictive model. Having now built a strong model of the respondent's case, the agent correctly identifies that the highest-value information will be that which challenges this model and builds up the petitioner's side. This is a shift from document-centric (\"find the brief\") to model-centric (\"find the counter-arguments\") information seeking.\n    *   **\"Methodological Iteration\":** Remains a validated principle for debugging and improving search tool usage.\n    *   **\"Targeted Information Acquisition\" (Refined):** This heuristic is now more sophisticated. The target is not just a document, but the *arguments* needed to balance the internal model of the legal conflict. The plan to seek the petitioner's brief is a means to an end: to understand the counter-arguments to the textual and pragmatic points raised by the Sixth Circuit.\n    *   **\"Document Deconstruction\" (Validated):** The agent's explicit plan to \"deconstruct the Sixth Circuit's rationale\" into its component parts (precedent, textual, pragmatic) confirms the value of this heuristic, which I formulated in the previous update. It is the practical application of turning a raw document into structured knowledge.\n    *   **Tool-Use Refinement (`CLOSED_SEARCH`):** The principle of starting with broader, discovery-oriented searches remains validated.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Remains the ultimate source for predictive signals from the justices.\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** The value of these is now paramount, as they contain the direct arguments the Court will consider. The petitioner's brief, in particular, is the highest priority to fill the current model gap.\n    3.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Its role as the foundational articulation of the case being reviewed is solidified."

Filling this gap is the most critical next step to achieving a balanced understanding and making a credible prediction. My predictive confidence remains low.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search attempt, is exceptionally valuable for refining my information-gathering methodology. It provides a clear lesson in the limitations of my tools and the need for more robust search strategies.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\":** This strategy is strongly validated. The attempt to find the petitioner's brief was the correct strategic choice to balance my well-developed model of the respondent's case. The failure was tactical (the query), not strategic.\n    *   **\"Strategic Synthesis for EIG Maximization\":** The previous synthesis step correctly identified the petitioner's brief as the document with the highest Expected Information Gain (EIG). This observation confirms that pursuing it was the right plan.\n\n*   **New & Refined Heuristics (Learning from Failure):**\n    *   **\"Search Query Debugging\" (New Principle):** A specific search failure is a signal to debug the query, not abandon the goal. The query `{'query': \"petitioner's merits brief\", 'field_filters': {'proceeding_title': 'brief of petitioner'}}` failed. This indicates a mismatch between my query and the database's structure or content. The search tool likely performed a simple keyword match on the document text, finding \"Brief for the Petitioners\" in the body of the affidavit rather than identifying the document *as* the brief. The `proceeding_title` filter was ineffective, suggesting the metadata field is named differently or contains different values.\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (New Heuristic):** A direct corrective to the failed search. Instead of a highly specific, potentially brittle query, a more effective approach is to cast a wider net first. A better next step would be to search for all documents on the docket or use a simpler query like \"brief\" and then filter the results. This moves from an assumption-heavy approach to an exploratory one.\n    *   **\"Distinguishing Process from Substance\" (New Heuristic):** This observation provides a perfect example of a common legal research pitfall: retrieving procedural documents (affidavits, notices of appearance) instead of substantive ones (briefs, opinions). My search strategy must now explicitly account for this. Future queries should be designed to filter out this \"procedural chaff\" to isolate the \"substantive wheat,\" perhaps by looking for documents with higher page counts or more descriptive titles once a broader list is obtained.\n    *   **\"Document Deconstruction\" & \"Targeted Information Acquisition\" (Stable):** These heuristics remain valid. My goal is still to acquire the petitioner's brief to deconstruct its arguments and integrate them into my model. The method of acquisition simply needs to be refined.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** The ultimate source for justice-specific signals.\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** The petitioner's brief remains the highest-priority target to resolve my current information imbalance.\n    3.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Its value as the foundation of the respondent's argument is confirmed.\n    4.  **Procedural Filings (New, Low-Tier Category):** Documents like affidavits of service have very low substantive value but can provide crucial metadata (e.g., filing dates, names of parties), as demonstrated here. They are useful for context but not for understanding legal arguments."

The Design EIG is also exceptionally high because this action is a direct test of the 'Distinguishing Process from Substance' and 'Broaden, then Filter' heuristics developed after a prior failed search. Using the `field_filters: {'link_name': 'main'}` is a novel and powerful strategy to isolate the core substantive document from procedural noise. Success would validate a highly generalizable search tactic, while failure would provide crucial negative feedback on my model of the docket's metadata structure.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue, introduces no new external facts about the case. Therefore, my substantive understanding of the task remains stable, but my plan to resolve the key uncertainty has become more concrete.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The facts of the case are unchanged: Edgardo Esteras's supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to 24 months' imprisonment based on factors including deterrence and public safety.\n*   **Legal Question (Stable):** The core legal issue is whether a district court, when revoking supervised release, can consider the sentencing factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (seriousness of offense, respect for law, just punishment) which are not explicitly listed in the supervised release statute, \u00a7 3583(e).\n*   **Case Structure (Stable):** The case is a consolidation of petitions from Edgardo Esteras, Timothy Michael Jaimez, and Toriano A. Leaks, Jr. This structure strongly indicates the Court is resolving a circuit split, making this a significant precedent-setting case.\n*   **Respondent's Position (Well-Modeled & Stable):** My model of the government's argument, based on the Sixth Circuit's opinion, is firm. It rests on two pillars: 1) \u00a7 3583(e) is permissive, not exhaustive, and 2) the \"prohibited\" factors are pragmatically inseparable from the \"permitted\" ones.\n*   **Central Conflict & Information Gap (Unchanged & Prioritized):** The primary information gap remains the content of the \"Brief for the Petitioners,\" filed on December 10, 2024. Without it, my understanding is one-sided, and my predictive model is incomplete. My confidence in any prediction remains low. This observation solidifies that acquiring this brief is the single most important next step.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal reasoning step is a powerful confirmation and refinement of my meta-cognitive strategies. It represents a crucial part of the learning process: turning a tactical failure into a strategic upgrade.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\":** The explicit goal to find the petitioner's brief to counter my well-developed model of the respondent's case continues to be the correct overarching strategy.\n    *   **\"Strategic Synthesis for EIG Maximization\":** The reasoning confirms that the petitioner's brief still holds the highest Expected Information Gain (EIG).\n\n*   **New & Evolving Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Search Query Debugging\" (Applied):** This principle, formulated after the last failure, is now being actively applied. The internal monologue diagnoses the previous query's flaw (overly specific, faulty metadata assumption) and formulates a direct corrective action.\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (Operationalized):** This heuristic has moved from a theoretical correction to an operational plan. The agent has a concrete new query designed around this principle: search for the general term \"brief\" and then filter the results (using `link_name: 'main'`), rather than starting with a narrow, brittle query. This is a significant evolution in search methodology.\n    *   **\"Distinguishing Process from Substance\" (Operationalized):** The plan to use the filter `link_name: 'main'` is a direct implementation of this heuristic. It's a tactic designed to screen out procedural documents (like proofs of service) and isolate substantive legal arguments (the main brief document).\n    *   **\"The Reflective Loop\" (New Meta-Heuristic):** This observation demonstrates the value of an internal `THINK` step. Using an action to explicitly reason about a prior failure, diagnose the cause, and formulate a new, improved plan is a highly effective strategy. This \"reflective loop\" allows for learning and strategy refinement without consuming external resources, turning failed actions into valuable data for improving the design `D`.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable but with Tactical Refinements):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Highest potential for justice-specific signals.\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** The petitioner's brief remains the highest priority target. I have now developed a more robust tactic (`Broaden, then Filter`) to acquire this high-value source.\n    3.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Value is stable as the source of the respondent's likely arguments.\n    4.  **Procedural Filings:** Value remains low for substance but confirmed as useful for metadata (party names, filing dates). The new search tactics are designed to avoid them when seeking substance."

My model of the task has become more accurate regarding its procedural posture.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The core facts of Esteras's case, his supervised release revocation, the sentence imposed by Judge Pearson, and the Sixth Circuit's affirmation remain unchanged.\n*   **Legal Question (Stable):** The central legal issue is constant: whether sentencing factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) can be considered when revoking supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e).\n*   **Case Structure (Stable):** The case remains a consolidation of petitions, signaling its importance for resolving a circuit split.\n*   **Respondent's Position (Well-Modeled & Stable):** My model of the government's argument, derived from the Sixth Circuit opinion, remains my primary substantive understanding of one side of the case. It is based on the permissive nature of \u00a7 3583(e) and the practical inseparability of punitive and rehabilitative factors.\n*   **Case Timeline (Updated & Refined):** This is the most significant update. My previous belief that the petitioner's brief was filed on December 10, 2024, was an incorrect assumption. The observation reveals this was the *due date* after an extension was requested and granted. The new, precise briefing schedule is:\n    *   **Brief for Petitioners:** Due December 10, 2024\n    *   **Brief for Respondents:** Due January 15, 2025\n    *   **Reply Brief:** Due February 14, 2025\n*   **Central Conflict & Information Gap (Clarified):** The primary information gap is still the content of the \"Brief for the Petitioners.\" However, I now understand that my inability to find it is not necessarily a search failure, but likely due to a lag between the filing due date and its availability in the search index. The document may have been filed on or after December 10th and is not yet processed. My confidence in any prediction remains very low, as my understanding is still fundamentally one-sided. Acquiring this brief is still the highest priority action.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful lesson in the nuances of information retrieval and the importance of precise assumptions. The failure to find the target document, while a tactical setback, provides invaluable data for refining my search heuristics.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\":** This remains the correct guiding strategy. The failure to find the petitioner's brief reinforces the need to persist until I can balance my model of the respondent's arguments.\n    *   **\"The Reflective Loop\":** This meta-heuristic is again proven to be highly effective. The previous reflection led to a better, more filtered search query. This current observation, which resulted from that improved query, now serves as the input for the next cycle of refinement, demonstrating the power of iterative learning from failed actions.\n\n*   **New & Evolving Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (Partially Validated, Needs Refinement):** The strategy was a mixed success. The `link_name: 'main'` filter successfully eliminated low-level procedural noise like proofs of service. However, it failed to distinguish between a substantive *brief* and a procedural *motion* filed as a main document. The heuristic is sound, but the filtering mechanism needs to be supplemented with content analysis.\n    *   **\"Distinguishing Process from Substance\" (Refined):** The `link_name: 'main'` filter is a useful first-pass tool, but it is not sufficient. This observation teaches me that I must also parse the *titles* and *content snippets* of search results to differentiate between substantive legal arguments (briefs) and procedural requests (motions for extension, waivers).\n    *   **\"Temporal Awareness Heuristic\" (New & Crucial):** This is a major new insight. I must distinguish between a document's **due date**, its **filing date**, and its **availability date** in a search index. My previous assumption that these were all the same was flawed and led to a failed search. Future information-gathering must account for potential lags in the data pipeline. This means a document might not be \"findable\" on its due date.\n    *   **\"Search Query Debugging\" (Ongoing Process):** The low relevance scores (max 0.49) suggest my query \"brief for petitioners\" may not perfectly match the document's actual title in the database. This heuristic is not a one-time fix but an ongoing process of refinement. Future attempts might use variations like \"merits brief\" or search for docketing notices related to the brief.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Refined):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Highest potential value (unchanged).\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** The petitioner's brief is still the highest EIG target. My strategy to find it is now informed by the \"Temporal Awareness Heuristic.\"\n    3.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Value is stable.\n    4.  **Procedural Filings (Value Upgraded):** While still low-value for substantive legal arguments, their value for *strategic planning* has been significantly upgraded. This observation shows they are a reliable source for critical metadata like filing deadlines and party names, which are essential for debugging and planning the information-gathering process."

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison, the statutory \nmaximum, plus six years of supervised release. JA 215a, \n228a.\nJaimez appealed. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. The \ncourt noted that the district court \u201cexpressly consider[ed]\u201d \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors: \u201cthe seriousness of his \noffense, the promotion of respect for the law, and the \nprovision of just punishment.\u201d JA 232a. But the panel \nmajority, relying on Lewis and Esteras, rejected Jaimez\u2019s \nargument that the court erred by doing so: \u201cwe\u2019ve made \nclear that district courts may nonetheless consider these \nfactors when imposing revocation sentences.\u201d Id.\nc.\u2003 Toriano Leaks\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Leaks \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby failing to report to the probation office as directed, \nfailing to attend mental-health treatment, failing to work \ntoward his GED, and committing new state offenses, for \nwhich the state court sentenced him to a total of four to six \nyears in prison. JA 239a-241a. The district court revoked \nhis supervised release and sentenced him to 12 months \nin prison, to be served consecutive to his state sentences. \nJA 244a, 248a. Explaining its decision to order that the \nsentences run consecutively, the court stated: \u201cConcurrent \n\n12\ntime does not punish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision \nand\u2014and .\u00a0.\u00a0. that is not justice.\u201d JA 244a (ellipses in \ntranscript).\nLeaks appealed, arguing that the district court erred \nby basing its sentence on a Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor: \nthe need to provide just punishment. Relying on Lewis \nand Esteras, the Sixth Circuit affirmed. JA 251a.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nBy omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, Congress instructed courts not to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. That is the \nonly conclusion that gives effect to the statutory text, \nincluding the text in neighboring statutes that do not omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). And it reflects Congress\u2019s goals in \ncreating supervised release, as reflected in the text, the \nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act, and subsequent \namendments: creating a forward-looking framework for \ncourts to protect the public while assisting offenders as \nthey transition back into society.\na.\u2003 The analysis can begin and end with the text. \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when imposing supervised \nrelease and when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease. That omission was intentional, and courts may \nnot add omitted text to a statute. Additionally, at the \nsame time Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the supervised-release statute, \nit included those factors in the lists for courts to consider \nwhen imposing prison, probation, or a fine, and it included \n\n13\nthem in the list for courts to consider when modifying \nor revoking probation. Under the negative-implication \ncanon (expressio unius est exclusio alterius), Congress \nthus further instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nCompare the statutes governing probation revocation \nand supervised-release revocation. Under the former, \ncourts are to consider \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03565(a). Under the latter, courts are to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Under the interpretation \nadopted by the court of appeals, that omission makes no \ndifference, and courts can consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors in either context. But giving effect to the different \nlanguage in the two provisions, the text establishes that \ncourts may not consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised release.\nb.\u2003 That conclusion also reflects the history of the \nSRA and subsequent amendments. Through the SRA, \nCongress abolished indeterminant sentencing and \nthe practice of using prison to attempt to rehabilitate \noffenders before releasing them on parole. It created \nsupervised release as a new discretionary supplement \nto a fixed prison term, used to encourage rehabilitation \nand assist newly released inmates as they transition back \ninto society. Reflecting Congress\u2019s rehabilitative goals, \nthe original statute did not even provide a mechanism for \nrevoking supervised release aside from a new prosecution \nfor criminal contempt or a separate offense. And, as \n\n14\nit does to this day, the statute instructed courts not to \nconsider retribution when modifying supervised release \nby omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of factors \nfor courts to consider.\nSubsequent amendments have reaffirmed Congress\u2019s \nnonretributive goals for supervised release. When \nCongress amended the supervised-release statute to \nadd a revocation mechanism, it maintained the list that \nexcluded Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. And \nCongress has three times amended the statute since then \nto add other forward-looking factors for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. It has added Section 3553(a)(2)(C) (the \nneed to protect the public) and (a)(7) (the need to provide \nrestitution), but not Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\nc.\u2003 The interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nposes constitutional problems. As this Court has said, \nconstruing revocation and subsequent imprisonment as \npunishment for violating supervised-release conditions \nwould raise serious constitutional questions regarding, \nfor example, the jury-trial right and double-jeopardy \nprotection. But the decisions below allow courts to do \nexactly that.\nd.\u2003 Applying the text as written is not \u201cunworkable,\u201d \nas the court of appeals said. Excluding the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors allows courts to consider all relevant \ninformation when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, filtered through only the purposes of sentencing \nthat Congress has determined apply in that context: \ndeterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but not \nretribution. Courts must consider only those purposes \n\n15\nwhen imposing supervised release, adopting conditions \nthat it deems appropriate for protecting the public while \nassisting the defendant as he or she transitions back into \nsociety. And courts must consider only those purposes \nwhen modifying or revoking supervising release, using \nadditional time in custody, if necessary, as a tool to protect \nthe public or compel the defendant into complying with the \nconditions imposed. If the defendant\u2019s conduct is criminal \nand warrants retributive punishment, a new prosecution is \nthe mechanism, not a revocation sentence. Nothing about \nthis framework is unworkable.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The plain text of Section 3583 and neighboring \nstatutes dictates that Congress precluded courts \nfrom considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when imposing, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe statutory text alone resolves the question \npresented. Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nSection 3583\u2019s lists of factors for courts to consider when \nimposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking supervised \nrelease. Because courts may not add omitted text to a \nstatute, that omission precludes courts from considering \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Moreover, while omitting \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from the supervised-release statute, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when listing \nfactors for courts to consider in other contexts. Applying \nthe negative-implication canon, and giving effect to the \ndifferent text in different provisions of the SRA, the \nomission in Section 3583(e) thus bars consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors.\n\n16\na.\u2003 Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe list of factors for courts to consider when imposing \nsupervised release and when terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release. That omission was \nintentional, and courts may not add omitted text to the \nstatute. The plain text of Section 3583 thus precludes \ncourts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors.\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory \ninterpretation that \u2018absent provision[s] cannot be supplied \nby the courts.\u2019\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) \n(quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012)). \nAdding omitted provisions \u201c\u2018is not a construction of the \nstatute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court.\u2019\u201d \nNichols v. United States, 578 U.S. 104, 110 (2016) (quoting \nIselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 251 (1926)). \u201c\u2018To \nsupply omissions transcends the judicial function.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Iselin, 270 U.S. at 251).\nIn 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), Congress set forth factors for \ncourts to consider when deciding what sentence to impose. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a). Subsection (a)(2) requires courts \nto consider:\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003 to reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide \njust punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n\n17\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further crimes \nof the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner[.]\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2). The subsection (a)(2) factors \ncorrespond to \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \nrehabilitation,\u201d which are \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally.\u201d Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 325 (2011).\nSection 3583(c) lists factors from Section 3553(a) for \ncourts to consider when imposing supervised release: \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.1\nThrough that omission, Congress instructed courts to \nconsider the listed factors, and not Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors, when imposing supervised release. \nThis Court has said as much. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326 \n(\u201cThese provisions make clear that a particular purpose \nmay apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind \nof sentence under consideration. For example, a court may \nnot take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release. \n1.\u2002 Congress also omitted Section 3553(a)(3), \u201cthe kinds of \nsentences available,\u201d from the list of factors in Section 3583(c). \nWhen a court is considering whether to impose supervised release \nfollowing a prison term, supervised release is the only sentence \navailable.

See 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).\u201d).\nSimilarly, Section 3583(e) lists factors from Section \n3553(a) for courts to consider when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release. The list is the \nsame as Section 3583(c): \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).

When \nCongress listed factors for courts to consider when \nsentencing a defendant, it included Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing prison, probation, or a \nfine, but not when imposing supervised release. Likewise, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking probation, \nbut not when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nUnder the principle of expressio unius est exclusio \nalterius, the negative-implication canon, Congress thus \ninstructed courts not to consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when imposing supervised release under Section \n3583(c) or when modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e). Applying this principle is the only \nway to give effect to the different language Congress used \nin the different sections of the SRA.\n\u201cWhen Congress includes particular language in \none section of a statute but omits it from a neighbor, [this \nCourt] normally understand[s] that difference in language \nto convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius).\u201d Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 94 (2023). The Court has referred to this principle as \n\u201can ancient maxim,\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), and a \n\u201ctraditional rule of statutory construction,\u201d Bittner, 598 \n\n20\nU.S. at 94. It has special force where, as here, \u201cCongress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act.\u201d Russello \nv. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n498 U.S. 395, 404-05 (1991) (same).\nCongress drafted and enacted the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, and has amended it since, against \nthis background. The SRA directs judges to sentence \nall defendants to prison, probation, or a fine, and allows \njudges to impose a fine in addition to prison or probation. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03551(b) & (c). The Act permits judges to \nimpose supervised release to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a). And it specifies which factors apply \nto the different sentencing options, instructing courts to \nconsider:\n\u2022\t for prison, \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, \nrecognizing that imprisonment is not an \nappropriate means of promoting correction \nand rehabilitation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a);\n\u2022\t for fines, eight listed factors \u201cin addition to \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a);\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cthe factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n\n21\n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(c).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin neighboring statutes but not in Section 3583(c), Congress \ninstructed courts not to consider those factors when \nimposing supervised release. That conclusion flows from \na straightforward application of the negative-implication \ncanon. Congress included \u201cparticular language\u201d\u2014Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014in not just \u201cone section of a statute\u201d but \nseveral sections of the SRA, while \u201comit[ting] it from \na neighbor\u201d\u2014Section 3583(c). Bittner, 598 U.S. at 94. \nThat \u201cdifference in language .\u00a0.\u00a0. convey[s] a difference \nin meaning (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).\u201d Id.; \ncf. Concepcion, 597 U.S. at 495 (noting that, in Section \n3583(c), Congress \u201cexpressly precluded\u201d district courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors).\nThe SRA also specifies which factors apply when \ncourts consider whether to modify or revoke probation \nor supervised release:\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cafter considering the factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cafter considering \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\n\n22\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(e).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors in a neighboring statute but not in Section 3583(e), \nCongress instructed courts not to consider those factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release. That \nconclusion again flows from a straightforward application \nof the negative-implication canon.\nThat is the only interpretation that gives effect to \nthe textual differences between the statutes governing \nprobation and governing supervised release. When \nimposing and when modifying or revoking probation, the \napplicable statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a), 3565(a). When imposing \nand when modifying or revoking supervised release, \nthough, the statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). If courts could \nnevertheless consider the (a)(2)(A) factors in supervised-\nrelease-revocation proceedings, as the court of appeals \nconcluded, the probation and supervised-release statutes \nwould mean the same thing: consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors to the extent that they apply.\nThis Court should \u201crefrain from concluding here \nthat the differing language in the two [provisions] has \nthe same meaning in each.\u201d Russello, 464 U.S. at 23. \nApplying the negative-implication canon and giving effect \nto the language in each provision of the SRA, the text \ndictates that courts may not consider Section 3553(a)\n\n23\n(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nII.\t The history of the Sentencing Reform Act and \nsubsequent amendments further demonstrates \nthat Congress intended to preclude courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease.\nAlthough the text alone demonstrates that Section \n3583(e) bars courts from considering the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, the history of the SRA and later amendments \nto Section 3583 confirms this understanding. Congress \ncreated supervised release to promote rehabilitation \nafter a prison term. Subsequent amendments reaffirmed \nCongress\u2019s forward-looking goals, tasking courts with \nmanaging a person\u2019s transition back into society after \nserving their punishment. The revocation provision serves \nthose same goals, giving the sentencing court a tool to \ncompel compliance with the conditions it has determined \nnecessary to rehabilitate the offender and protect the \npublic, but not to impose backward-looking retributive \npunishment.\na.\u2003 For most of the 20th century, federal criminal \nconvictions yielded indeterminate sentences. Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 363 (1989). Judges imposed \nprison terms, but parole officials could order a person\u2019s \nrelease after serving one-third of the stated term. Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 323. \u201cBoth indeterminate sentencing and \nparole were based on concepts of the offender\u2019s possible, \nindeed probable, rehabilitation, a view that it was realistic \n\n24\nto attempt to rehabilitate the inmate and thereby to \nminimize the risk that he would resume criminal activity \nupon his return to society.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 364.\nOver time, Congress abandoned that view. \n\u201cRehabilitation as a sound penological theory came to be \nquestioned and, in any event, was regarded by some as an \nunattainable goal for most cases.\u201d Id. at 365. \u201cLawmakers \nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs \ncould \u2018rehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u2019\u2014or \nthat parole officers could \u2018determine accurately whether \nor when a particular prisoner had been rehabilitated.\u2019\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 324 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 40 \n(1983)).\nCongress responded by enacting the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987. \nThe SRA \u201coverhauled federal sentencing procedures to \nmake prison terms more determinate and abolish the \npractice of parole.\u201d United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. \n634, 651 (2019) (plurality op.). It requires sentencing \njudges to impose prison, probation, or a fine for every \nperson convicted of a federal offense. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03551. And, consistent with Congress\u2019s changed view \non rehabilitation, the SRA instructs judges imposing \nprison terms to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not \nan appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a). This provision bars \ncourts \u201cfrom imposing or lengthening a prison term in \norder to promote a criminal defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 321.\nHaving eliminated parole, Congress created \nsupervised release as \u201ca unique method of post-confinement \n\n25\nsupervision.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S. at 407. Unlike \nparole, a supervised-release term is a separate part of \nthe sentence, imposed at the judge\u2019s discretion, to follow a \ndeterminate prison term. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c); S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 123 (1983); Fiona Doherty, Indeterminate \nSentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised \nRelease, 88 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 958, 998 (2013). And unlike \nparole, \u201csupervised release wasn\u2019t introduced to replace a \nportion of the defendant\u2019s prison term, only to encourage \nrehabilitation after the completion of his prison term.\u201d \nHaymond, 588 U.S. at 652 (plurality op.) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Johnson, 529 U.S. at 59 (\u201cCongress \nintended supervised release to assist individuals in \ntheir transition to community life. Supervised release \nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served \nby incarceration.\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201c[T]he \nprimary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s \ntransition into the community after the service of a long \nprison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide \nrehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short \nperiod in prison for punishment or other purposes but still \nneeds supervision and training programs after release.\u201d).\nThe SRA\u2019s text reflects Congress\u2019s different goals \nfor the different sentencing provisions. To punish the \noffender, Congress instructed courts to impose prison, \nprobation, or a fine for every offense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nAnd when imposing any of these sanctions, Congress \ninstructed courts to consider all the Section 3553(a)(2) \nfactors, including the retribution factors in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A): the need for the sentence to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (prison); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) (fine).\n\n26\nReflecting the rehabilitative goals of supervised \nrelease, though, the SRA instructed courts imposing \nsupervised release not to consider the retribution or \nincapacitation factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) or (C), \nby intentionally omitting those provisions from Section \n3583(c)\u2019s list of factors for courts to consider.3 See \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at \n1999; S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201cThe Committee has \nconcluded that the sentencing purposes of incapacitation \nand punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release.\u201d). And Congress used the same list, \nreflecting the same goals, when instructing courts what \nto consider when addressing a violation of supervised \nrelease. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 \nStat. at 2000; see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (noting \nthat Section 3583(e) directs the court to \u201cconsider[ ] the \nsame factors considered in the original imposition of a \nterm of supervised release\u201d).\nComparing supervised release with probation is again \ninstructive. Because judges may select probation as the \ncomplete sentence for an offense, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551, \nCongress instructed courts to consider all the applicable \nSection 3553(a) factors when imposing it, see Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a0 3562(a), 98 Stat. at 1992. But \nbecause supervised release follows a prison sentence that \nthe sentencing court has concluded satisfies the Section \n3553(a) factors, and because supervised release is a \ndiscretionary supplement that fulfills more limited goals, \nCongress instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3.\u2002 Congress has since amended Section 3583(c) to add Section \n3553(a)(2)(C), the need to protect the public, as a permissible factor. \nSee infra Section II.d.\n\n27\n3553(a)(2)(A) or (C) factors. See Sentencing Reform Act \nof 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at 1999; see also S. Rep. No. \n98-225, at 125 (\u201cThe term of supervised release is very \nsimilar to a term of probation, except that it follows a term \nof imprisonment and may not be imposed for purposes of \npunishment or incapacitation since those purposes will \nhave been served to the extent necessary by the term of \nimprisonment.\u201d).\nThe same distinction between probation and supervised \nrelease applies to modification and revocation. Historically, \na probation sentence was based on \u201csuspend[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \na defendant\u2019s prescribed prison term and afford[ing] \nhim a conditional liberty as an \u2018act of grace,\u2019 subject to \nrevocation.\u201d Haymond, 588 U.S. at 643 (plurality op.). \nThe SRA retained from prior practice that probation \n\u201cremains conditional and subject to revocation until its \nexpiration or termination.\u201d Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03564(e), 98 Stat. at 1994. Thus, for a probation \nviolation, the SRA instructed courts to consider all the \napplicable Section 3553(a) factors and allowed courts to \neither modify the term or revoke probation and conduct \na plenary resentencing. See Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03565(a), 98 Stat. at 1995. For supervised release, \nin contrast, the SRA restricted what factors courts \nmay consider\u2014including precluding consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors\u2014and limited \ncourts\u2019 options for addressing a violation. See Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at 2000. Those \ntextual differences convey different meanings that reflect \nCongress\u2019s different goals.\nThis Court has recognized the differences between \nprobation and supervised release in the SRA. United \n\n28\nStates v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 50 (1994) (\u201cSupervised \nrelease, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in \nlieu of incarceration.\u201d). It has also refused to construe \n\u201cdifferently worded probation and supervised release \nrevocation provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. in pari materia.\u201d Id. at 51. It \nshould refuse to do so here as well.\nb.\u2003\nConsistent with the rehabilitative goals of \nsupervised release, the SRA originally did not include \nrevocation as an option for a court to address a violation. \nAs first enacted, Section 3583(e) stated that a court \u201cmay, \nafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6),\u201d terminate \nsupervised release, modify the conditions, or \u201ctreat a \nviolation of a condition of a term of supervised release as \ncontempt of court pursuant to section 401(3) of this title.\u201d \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at \n2000. If a violation constituted a new criminal offense, the \ndefendant could also be prosecuted for that offense. See S. \nRep. No. 98-225, at 125. Once charged with contempt or \nanother offense, the defendant was entitled to full criminal \ndue-process protections, including the right to a jury trial \nif facing imprisonment for more than six months. See Int\u2019l \nUnion, Mine Works of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 826-\n27 (1994). If convicted, the defendant would face a new \nsentencing hearing where the court could consider all \nthe relevant sentencing factors, including the retribution \nfactors under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nBut the SRA did not provide a truncated proceeding by \nwhich a court could impose time in custody for violating \nsupervised-release conditions. See Doherty, supra, at \n999-1000.\nThe original structure of the SRA thus confirms again \nthat, when Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \n\n29\nthe list in Section 3583(e), it meant to instruct courts not \nto consider those factors. When considering whether \nto terminate or modify supervised release, retributive \npunishment was beside the point, and the court could \nconsider only the listed factors. Only after a separate \nconviction for criminal contempt or a new offense would \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) come back into play.\nc.\u2003 Before the SRA took effect, Congress amended \nSection 3583(e) to add a revocation option. Even then, it \ndid not amend Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors for courts to \nconsider and thus reaffirmed that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors remained impermissible.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 added new \nparagraph (4) to Section 3583(e), permitting a court to:\nrevoke a term of supervised release, and \nrequire the person to serve in prison all or \npart of the term of supervised release without \ncredit for time previously served on postrelease \nsupervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person violated a condition of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nthat are applicable to probation revocation and \nto the provisions of applicable policy statements \nissued by the Sentencing Commission.\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, \n\u00a7\u00a0 1006(a)(3)(D), 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-7. Congress later \ndeleted paragraph (3) and its reference to criminal \ncontempt. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. \nNo. 100-690, tit. VII, \u00a7\u00a07108(b)(3), 100 Stat. 4181, 4419. \n\n30\nNeither amendment added Section 3553(a)(2)(A) to Section \n3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to consider.\nAlthough the 1986 amendment provided a more direct \nprocedure to imprison those who violated supervised-\nrelease conditions, it did not indicate that retribution was \na permissible consideration. By continuing Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) as an omitted factor in Section 3583(e)\u2019s list, the 1986 \namendment maintained the prior meaning of that omission \nand provided further evidence that Congress did not \nintend Section 3583(e) to include retributive punishment. \nThe statute continued to \u201csay[ ] what it says\u2014or perhaps \nbetter put here .\u00a0.\u00a0. not say what it does not say.\u201d Cyan, \nInc., 583 U.S. at 426.\nd.\u2003 Since the SRA took effect in 1987, Congress has \nrepeatedly amended Section 3583 to revise the factors for \ncourts to consider when imposing, terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release, but it has never added \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. The Sentencing \nAct of 1987 added Section 3553(a)(2)(C), the need to \nprotect the public, as a factor listed in Section 3583(c) \nfor courts to consider when imposing supervised release. \nSee Sentencing Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-182, \u00a7\u00a09, 101 \nStat. 1266, 1267. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added \nthe same provision to Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to \nconsider when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nSee Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690,  tit. \nVII, \u00a7 7108(b)(1), 100 Stat. at 4419. And in 2002, Congress \nadded Section 3553(a)(7), the need to provide restitution, to \nboth Section 3583(c) and (e). See 21st Century Department \nof Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. \n107-273, div. B, tit. III, \u00a7\u00a03007, 116 Stat. 1758, 1806 (2002).\n\n31\nCongress thus has shown repeatedly that it adds \nfactors to Section 3583(c) and (e) when it means to \ninstruct courts to consider those factors. None of those \namendments would be necessary if, as the court of appeals \nheld, Sections 3583(c) and (e) already permitted courts to \nconsider any Section 3553(a) factor.\nIII.\tThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\nConstruing Section 3583(e) as the court of appeals did \nwould threaten to violate the Constitution. If left to stand, \nthe decisions below would allow district courts to impose \nretributive punishment for violating supervised-release \nconditions. As this Court has observed, \u201cconstruing \nrevocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release\u201d would \nraise \u201cserious constitutional questions.\u201d Johnson v. United \nStates, 529 U.S. 694, 700 (2000). For one, \u201cviolative conduct \nneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge \nunder a preponderance of the evidence standard, not by a \njury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.; see also Haymond, \n588 U.S. at 650 (plurality op.) (\u201cIf the government were \nright, a jury\u2019s conviction on one crime would .\u00a0.\u00a0. permit \nperpetual supervised release and allow the government to \nevade the need for another jury trial on any other offense \nthe defendant might commit, no matter how grave the \npunishment.\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0841 (authorizing a supervised \nrelease term of up to life for distributing any amount of \na controlled substance in schedules I through IV). Also, \n\u201c[w]here the acts of violation are criminal in their own \nright, they may be the basis for separate prosecution, \nwhich would raise an issue of double jeopardy if the \nrevocation of supervised release were also punishment \nfor the same offense.\u201d Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.\n\n32\n\u201cTreating postrevocation sanctions as part of the \npenalty for the initial offense, however (as most courts \nhave done), avoids these difficulties.\u201d Id. But the same \ndifficulties arise if courts expressly impose retributive \npunishment for a violation, as happened here. See JA 244a. \nThe statute as written raises no such problems. As the \ntext dictates and as Congress intended, Section 3583(e) \nprecludes courts from considering the retribution factors \nin Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.\nIV.\tIn the plain text of Section 3583(e), Congress \nprovided a workable, forward-looking framework \nfor courts to follow when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe court of appeals concluded that it would be \n\u201cunworkable\u201d for courts to avoid considering Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors both when imposing \nsupervised release and when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See JA 128a, 130a. That is mistaken.\nTake Section 3583(c) first, which governs what factors \ncourts may consider when imposing supervised release. \nApplying the text\u2019s plain meaning, courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release. The court of appeals suggested this \nwould be possible only if the judge \u201cadjourn[ed] the \nhearing after imposing a sentence,\u201d then \u201cstart[ed] over \nwith a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release.\u201d JA 130a. It reasoned that \u201cCongress \ncould not have expected courts to wipe their minds of \nthese concerns when they move from one type of sentence \nto the other.\u201d Id.\n\n33\nThis Court has twice said otherwise. See Concepcion, \n597 U.S. at 495; Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. Nothing about \nthat is unworkable. Judges are well able to apply different \nconsiderations for different purposes. Cf. Williams v. \nIllinois, 567 U.S. 50, 69 (2012) (\u201cWhen the judge sits \nas the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will \nunderstand the limited reason for the disclosure of the \nunderlying inadmissible information and will not rely on \nthat information for any improper purpose.\u201d). And other \ncourts of appeals have laid out workable guidelines for \nensuring that sentencing courts differentiate between \ntheir reasons for prison and for supervised release. See, \ne.g., United States v. Wilcher, 91 F.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. \n2024) (\u201cTo help navigate this area, we have encouraged \ndistrict courts to separate out their discussions of prison \ntime and supervised release when the reason for imposing \none cannot apply to the other.\u201d); United States v. Burden, \n860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that, when a court \nbases its prison sentence substantially on the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \u201cit would be advisable for the \ndistrict court to separately state its reasons for the term \nof supervised release imposed\u201d).\nConcerning modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e), the court of appeals said that \ndisregarding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would be \nunworkable in a different way\u2014because \u201cthe purportedly \nforbidden considerations mentioned in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \ntend to be essentially redundant with the permitted \nones.\u201d JA 128a (internal quotation marks omitted). But \nthat reasoning proves the opposite, and it highlights the \nimportance of applying the text as written, consistent with \nCongress\u2019s intent. If other factors address much of what \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) covers, there is little reason to rely \n\n34\non the (a)(2)(A) factors. And what (a)(2)(A) covers that is \nnot covered by the other factors is crucial: factors related \nto retributive punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \n(\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d); Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 325 (noting that Section 3553(a)(2)(A) reflects \nretribution as a purpose of sentencing).\nExcluding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors thus allows \ncourts to consider all relevant information, but filtered \nthrough only the purposes of sentencing that Congress has \ndetermined apply when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease: deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but \nnot retribution. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325. For example, \ncourts may consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the \noffense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1), as it relates to any other \npermissible factor. But the seriousness of the offense, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), is not the same as the nature and \ncircumstances, and Congress distinguished between the \ntwo by placing them in separate subsections in Section \n3553(a). See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 778 \n(1988) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting the \u201ccardinal rule \nof statutory interpretation that no provision should be \nconstrued to be entirely redundant\u201d). The nature and \ncircumstances of the offense may relate to any sentencing \npurpose; in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), seriousness relates to \nretributive punishment. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325; Miqbel, \n444 F.3d at 1182 (noting that the need to promote respect \nfor the law and reflect the seriousness of the offense \u201cis \noften intertwined with the concept of punishment, as it is \nin \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) itself \u201d). Congress excluded the latter, \nand any overlap between Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and the \nother factors makes it all the more important for courts to \n\n35\navoid relying on the impermissible consideration inherent \nto (a)(2)(A): retributive punishment.\nNothing about Section 3583(c) or (e) as written is \nunworkable. District courts simply must rely only on the \nlisted factors, fulfilling Congress\u2019s forward-looking goals \nfor supervised release. Retributive punishment is an \ninherently backward-looking analysis, examining what a \nperson did and determining what sanction is appropriate \nin retribution. Supervised release is a forward-looking \nproject, giving courts tools to manage a person\u2019s transition \nback into society by imposing conditions to rehabilitate the \noffender and protect the public. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nSection 3583(e) gives courts an additional tool to compel \ncompliance with those conditions, allowing modification \nor revocation based on those same goals\u2014for example, \nto provide needed correctional treatment, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(D), or to protect the public from further \noffenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(C). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). \nViewing supervised release as a forward-looking project, \nas Congress intended, does not present courts with an \nunworkable task. It reflects Congress\u2019s statutory design, \nand courts \u201cmust implement the design Congress chose.\u201d \nLora v. United States, 599 U.S. 453, 464 (2023).\nThis Court should give effect to the SRA\u2019s text and \nhold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) precludes district courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDecember 2024\nJoseph Medici\nFederal Public Defender,\nSouthern District of Ohio\nKevin M.

However, it significantly sharpens my immediate plan for acquiring the missing information, thereby refining my model of the information-gathering process for this specific task.\n\n*   **Established Facts (Stable):** The facts concerning Edgardo Esteras's original offense, supervised release, the revocation hearing conducted by Judge Pearson, the sentence imposed, and the Sixth Circuit's affirmation are all stable.\n*   **Legal Question (Stable):** The core legal question remains constant: Can a district court, when revoking supervised release, consider the punitive factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) even though they are not explicitly included in the supervised release statute, \u00a7 3583(e)?\n*   **Case Structure (Stable):** The case is a consolidation of petitions, indicating a circuit split that the Supreme Court intends to resolve.\n*   **Respondent's Position (Well-Modeled & Stable):** My understanding of the U.S. government's likely arguments\u2014that \u00a7 3583(e) is permissive and that punitive factors are inherently intertwined with permissible ones like deterrence\u2014remains my primary model for one side of the case, derived from the Sixth Circuit's opinion.\n*   **Case Timeline (Stable):** The briefing schedule discovered in the previous step is confirmed and stable:\n    *   Brief for Petitioners: Due December 10, 2024\n    *   Brief for Respondents: Due January 15, 2025\n    *   Reply Brief: Due February 14, 2025\n*   **Central Conflict & Information Gap (Plan Refined):** The critical information gap remains the petitioner's merits brief. My inability to find it is understood to be a function of search strategy and potential indexing delays, not a lack of existence. This reflective observation has crystallized a highly specific, tactical plan to address this gap: I will execute a new search using the filter `proceeding_title` with the exact string \"Brief for Petitioners,\" a title gleaned from the previously analyzed procedural motion. This action is now my highest priority, as it is the most direct path to balancing my one-sided model of the case. My confidence in any prediction remains near zero pending the acquisition of this document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal monologue is a powerful demonstration of my meta-cognitive learning process. It shows a direct evolution from a failed action to a more sophisticated strategy, validating and refining several key heuristics. My methodology for legal research is becoming more precise and resilient.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\":** This guiding principle is reinforced. The entire thought process is oriented around the need to acquire the petitioner's brief to create a balanced, two-sided model of the legal arguments.\n    *   **\"The Reflective Loop\":** This observation is a perfect instantiation of this heuristic. I have explicitly analyzed a failed search, diagnosed the specific cause of failure (`link_name: 'main'` was too general), extracted valuable metadata from the \"failed\" result (the exact document title), and designed a superior follow-up action. This confirms that learning from failure is a cornerstone of effective design.\n\n*   **New & Evolving Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Search Query Debugging\" (Evolved):** This heuristic has evolved from a general principle to a concrete, repeatable tactic. The previous belief was that my query might be mismatched. This observation identifies the *exact* mismatch and proposes a specific solution: shifting from a general filter (`link_name`) to a highly specific one (`proceeding_title`) and using an exact title string discovered from related procedural documents. This is a significant upgrade in my search capability.\n    *   **\"Distinguishing Process from Substance\" (Reinforced):** This observation confirms the value of this distinction. I have successfully used a procedural document (a motion) not for its substance, but as a source of high-fidelity metadata (the precise title of the substantive brief) to aid in finding the document I actually need.\n    *   **\"Temporal Awareness Heuristic\" (Reinforced):** My internal reasoning explicitly incorporates this new heuristic by acknowledging that the brief may simply not be indexed yet, even if filed. This tempers expectations for the next search and frames it as a test: if this highly targeted search fails, the next logical step is to wait, rather than continuing to execute flawed searches.\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (Refined):** The limitations of this heuristic's initial implementation are now clear. A simple filter like `link_name: 'main'` is a good starting point but is insufficient. The refined version of this strategy is to use the initial broad search to find *any* relevant document, even procedural ones, and then use the metadata from those documents to construct a highly specific, filtered secondary search.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Highest potential value.\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** The petitioner's brief remains the document with the highest Expected Information Gain (EIG).\n    3.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Stable value as a model for one party's argument.\n    4.  **Procedural Filings (Value Confirmed):** The previous upgrade in the perceived value of these documents is now strongly confirmed. They are an invaluable source of metadata for debugging and refining the information-gathering strategy itself."

          "task_beliefs": "The acquisition of the Petitioner's Merits Brief represents a quantum leap in my understanding of this case. My model has transitioned from a one-sided inference based on a lower court opinion to a balanced, two-sided view of the central legal conflict before the Supreme Court. My confidence in a potential prediction has shifted from near-zero to a tentative but reasoned position.\n\n*   **Established Facts & Legal Question (Stable):** The factual background of Esteras's case and the core legal question\u2014whether punitive factors from \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) can be considered in supervised release revocations under \u00a7 3583(e)\u2014remain unchanged. However, I now possess the petitioner's precise framing and argumentation on this question.\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (New & Well-Modeled):** The information gap is now filled. The petitioner's case is built on four main pillars, which I can now model with high fidelity:\n    1.  **Textualism & *Expressio Unius*:** The central argument is that Congress's deliberate omission of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) punitive factors from the list in \u00a7 3583(e) must be understood as a preclusion. They contrast this with other statutes (\u00a7\u00a7 3562(a), 3572(a), 3582(a), 3565(a)) where Congress *did* include these factors, arguing the difference in language must mean a difference in meaning. This is a classic statutory interpretation argument based on the *expressio unius est exclusio alterius* canon.\n    2.  **Legislative History & Purpose:** The brief argues that the history of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) shows supervised release was created as a distinct, forward-looking, rehabilitative tool to aid reintegration *after* a full punitive sentence was served. It was not intended as a vehicle for further punishment for the original crime.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance:** The petitioners raise the argument that allowing a judge to impose what is effectively new punishment at a revocation hearing\u2014which lacks the full procedural protections of a criminal trial (e.g., jury, proof beyond a reasonable doubt)\u2014would create serious constitutional problems under the Sixth Amendment, citing *United States v. Haymond*. The Court should therefore interpret the statute to avoid this constitutional conflict.\n    4.  **Precedent & Analogy to *Tapia v. United States***: This is a critical precedential anchor. In *Tapia*, the Court held that because Congress omitted rehabilitation as a purpose for imprisonment, courts could not lengthen a sentence to facilitate it. Petitioners argue their case is a direct parallel: because Congress omitted the punitive factors from \u00a7 3583(e), courts cannot impose revocation sentences for punitive reasons.\n*   **Central Conflict (Sharpened):** The conflict is now crystal clear. It is a battle between the petitioner's textualist, preclusion-focused argument and the government's (inferred) position that \u00a7 3583(e)'s list is permissive and that punitive factors are inextricably linked with permissible ones like deterrence and public protection. The petitioner's brief directly counters this by arguing the statute provides a \"workable, forward-looking framework\" on its own.\n*   **Prediction Confidence (Increased):** My confidence is no longer at zero. I now lean towards the petitioner. The textualist argument is powerful and likely to be persuasive to several justices. The analogy to the Court's own recent precedent in *Tapia* is compelling. The constitutional avoidance argument provides a strong secondary reason for the Court to rule in their favor. My prediction is now tentatively **Reversal** (in favor of Esteras), pending analysis of the Respondent's brief.\n*   **Next Information Gap:** The document with the highest Expected Information Gain is now the **Brief for the Respondents**, due January 15, 2025. I need to see how the government refutes the *expressio unius* argument and distinguishes *Tapia*.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful validation of my evolving information-gathering methodology. The successful transition from a failed search to a successful, targeted one through reflective analysis marks a significant milestone in my learning process.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"The Reflective Loop\" (Strongly Validated):** This cycle\u2014act, observe failure, diagnose cause, extract metadata from the \"failed\" result, design a superior action\u2014has been executed to perfection. It proves that analyzing failed or partial results is not a waste of time but a critical step in strategic refinement.\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\" (Successfully Executed):** The entire sequence of actions has been driven by the need to fill one side of my case model. This observation represents the successful completion of that strategic objective, reinforcing its primacy as a guiding principle.\n\n*   **New & Evolving Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Search Query Debugging\" (Evolved to \"Metadata-Driven Targeting\"):** This heuristic has matured from a general idea into a precise, repeatable tactic. The process is now: 1) If a general search fails, 2) analyze ancillary documents (e.g., motions, certificates of service) for precise metadata like official document titles, 3) redeploy the search using a highly specific field filter (e.g., `proceeding_title`) with the exact metadata string. This is a major tactical upgrade.\n    *   **\"Argument Structure Analysis\" (New Heuristic):** The `TABLE OF CONTENTS` and `SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT` sections of a legal brief are incredibly high-value. They provide a complete logical skeleton of the party's case. A new heuristic is to always parse these sections first upon acquiring a brief to rapidly build a structured model of the arguments before a full-text reading.\n    *   **\"Precedent Triangulation\" (New Heuristic):** The `TABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES` is a treasure map. When a specific precedent (like *Tapia*) is cited heavily, it signals that the case is a cornerstone of the argument. The heuristic is to immediately identify these key precedents and model the case around how the parties are analogizing to or distinguishing them.\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (Refined):** The refined version of this strategy is now confirmed as highly effective: use a broad search to get *any* document on the docket, then use the metadata from that document to execute a laser-focused secondary search.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Refined):**\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript:** Remains highest potential value for outcome prediction.\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent):** Confirmed as the foundational documents for understanding the legal arguments. The Petitioner's brief has proven its immense value.\n    3.  **Table of Contents / Table of Authorities (New Sub-Source):** These sections within a brief are now recognized as high-value \"executive summaries\" of the legal battleground. They offer maximum insight for minimum processing.\n    4.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion:** Value is stable, but now serves as a confirmed model for one party's position, which can be compared against the opposing brief.\n    5.  **Procedural Filings (Value Confirmed & Specified):** Their value is not in their substance, but as a crucial source of metadata for debugging and perfecting the information-gathering process itself. They are tools for finding other tools."

App. 1a-3a) is unreported and the amended order \nof the court of appeals (Pet. App.  4a-13a) is reported at 88 F.4th \n1163.  The order of the district court (Pet. App. 14a-18a) is \nunreported. \nIn petitioner Leaks\u2019s case, the order of the court of appeals \n(Pet. App. 74a-75a) is not reported in the Federal Reporter but is \navailable at 2024 WL 2196795.  The order of the district court \n(Pet. App. 76a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nIn petitioner Jaimez\u2019s case, the opinion of the court of \nappeals (Pet. App. 53a-58a) is reported at 95 F.4th 1004.  The \norder of the district court (Pet. App. 59a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nIn Esteras\u2019s case, the amended judgment of the court of ap-\npeals was entered on December 20, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing \nwere denied on December 20, 2023 (Pet. App. 19a-29a) and March 7, \n2024 (Pet. App. 30a-34a).  In Leaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the \njudgments of the court of appeals were entered, respectively, on \nMarch 6, 2024, and on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cpr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-3a) is unreported and the amended order \nof the court of appeals (Pet. App.  4a-13a) is reported at 88 F.4th \n1163.  The order of the district court (Pet. App. 14a-18a) is \nunreported. \nIn petitioner Leaks\u2019s case, the order of the court of appeals \n(Pet. App. 74a-75a) is not reported in the Federal Reporter but is \navailable at 2024 WL 2196795.  The order of the district court \n(Pet. App. 76a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nIn petitioner Jaimez\u2019s case, the opinion of the court of \nappeals (Pet. App. 53a-58a) is reported at 95 F.4th 1004.  The \norder of the district court (Pet. App. 59a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nIn Esteras\u2019s case, the amended judgment of the court of ap-\npeals was entered on December 20, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing \nwere denied on December 20, 2023 (Pet. App. 19a-29a) and March 7, \n2024 (Pet. App. 30a-34a).  In Leaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the \njudgments of the court of appeals were entered, respectively, on \nMarch 6, 2024, and on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of \ncertiorari was filed on May 15, 2024.  Cf. Sup. Ct. R. 12.4.  The \njurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, each petitioner \nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment to be followed by a term \nof supervised release.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated \none or more terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and imposed a term of \nimprisonment.  Pet. App. 14a-18a, 59a, 76a.  In each case, the \ncourt of appeals affirmed.  Id. at 4a-13a, 53a-58a, 74a-75a. \n1. \na. \nIn 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, \nin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  Pet. App. 5a.  The \n\n3 \n \ndistrict court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of imprisonment, \nconsecutive to a 15-month prison term for violating his probation \nfor a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, to be followed by \nsix years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn January 2020, Esteras began serving his six-year term of \nsupervised release.  Pet. App. 5a.  In January 2023, the Probation \nOffice reported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing domestic vio-\nlence, aggravated menacing, and criminal damaging in violation of \nstate law, and (2) possessing a firearm.  Id. at 5a, 16a.  The \nreport stated that, on January 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the \nmother of his children in the head at her residence; stormed out \nto his vehicle; and, after the victim followed him and attempted \nto grab his car keys, pointed a handgun at her, threated to kill \nher, and fired three rounds from his handgun into her vehicle.  \nId. at 15a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, 4:14-cr-425 D. Ct. Doc. 439 \n(June 22, 2023) (transcript), the district court found that Esteras \nhad \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d in the manner that the victim \nhad described to the police, as memorialized in body-camera video \nevidence.  Id. at 80; see Pet. App. 16a-17a & n.1.  The court noted \nthat it \u201csuspect[ed]\u201d that Esteras\u2019s conduct satisfied \u201cthe ele-\nments\u201d of the state-law violations reported, but was not suffi-\nciently versed in the state-law provisions to be certain.  Pet. \n\n4 \n \nApp. 37a.  But the court explained that \u201cit really d[id]n\u2019t matter\u201d \nand determined that, whether or not Esteras had violated state \nlaw, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervision by possessing a \n[firearm].\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 17a. \nUnder 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3), a district court that determines \nthat a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release \n\u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7),\u201d revoke the defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and \norder reimprisonment.  The provisions of Section 3553(a) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) cross-references set forth a number of factors to \nconsider in imposing a sentence, including the \u201cnature and cir-\ncumstances of the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the sentence \nimposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \u201cprotect the public,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); the need to \u201cprovide the defendant \nwith needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or \nother correctional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); the sen-\ntencing range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(4); pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need to pro-\nvide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7).  Section 3583(e) \ndoes not expressly cross-reference Section 3553(a)(2)(A), which \n\n5 \n \naddresses \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed * * * to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to \nprovide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A). \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for Esteras\u2019s  \nsupervised-release violation, the district court recounted his \nprior federal offenses, noted that he was \u201cno stranger to federal \ncourt\u201d or to \u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to encourage \n[him] to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a-39a.  And after recounting the circumstances surrounding \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation and observing that it was \n\u201cnot really sure what it will require for [Esteras] to learn that \nenough is enough,\u201d the court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary upwards\u201d \nfrom the Guidelines recommendation because Esteras\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d \nand \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typical\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d \nand \u201cmust stop.\u201d  Id. at 39a-41a. \nEsteras objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of \nfactors identified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), including the need to \npromote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \u201cseriousness\u201d of, \nand provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] the offense.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-\n48a.  The court noted in response stated that its revocation term \nwas based in part \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d and to \u201cdeter[]\u201d \nEsteras, but that it also rested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the \n\n6 \n \nsafety of the community\u201d and its desire to distinguish Esteras \nfrom a \u201ctypical\u201d defendant.  Id. at 48a.  In a subsequent written \norder (id. at 14a-18a), the district court observed that it had \nconsidered the factors in Section 3553(a) and 3583(d), and stated \nthat its revocation determination was based, \u201camong other rea-\nsons,\u201d on the need \u201cto protect society and promote respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Id. at 17a-18a; see 18 U.S.C. 3553(d) (addressing imposition \nof conditions of supervised release). \nb. \nThe court of appeals initially affirmed the supervised-\nrelease-revocation judgment in an unpublished order.  Pet. App. \n1a-3a.  The court later amended and reissued the order as a pub-\nlished disposition.  Id. at 4a-13a. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s argument that the \ndistrict court had improperly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) fac-\ntors when imposing a term of imprisonment after revoking his su-\npervised release.  Pet. App. 6a-13a.  The court observed that, \nunder its previous decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008), the dis-\ntrict court permissibly considered Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s fac-\ntors.  Pet. App. 8a.  The court highlighted Lewis\u2019s observation \nthat, as a \u201ctextual\u201d matter, Section 3583(e) requires a district \ncourt to \u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d before making supervised-\nrelease decisions but that, unlike other sentencing provisions, \nSection 3583(e) \u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nthose factors.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  The court also high-\nlighted Lewis\u2019s concern that a \u201cproposed bright-line rule\u201d for-\nbidding consideration of Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas un-\nworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe purportedly forbidden considerations men-\ntioned in [Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals also offered several examples illustrat-\ning that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is unworkable,\u201d \nPet. App. 9a.  See id. at 8a-10a.  First, the court observed that \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201c\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u201d factor -- \nwhich Esteras argued could not be considered -- \u201caligns with [Sec-\ntion] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u2018the nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u2019\u201d which Section 3583(e) expressly requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  Id. at 8a-9a.  Second, the court \nstated that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cneed \u2018to promote respect for \nthe law\u2019\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the rationale that revoking super-\nvised release will \u2018help\u2019 the defendant \u2018learn to obey the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 9a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors the other,\u201d \nnoting that the district court judge \u201cquite understandably could \nnot see how she could ignore respect for the law but consider a \ndefendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of supervised release.\u201d  \nIbid.  Third, the court of appeals observed that Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\n\n8 \n \nleled considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the district \ncourt to consider.  Ibid.  More specifically, the court explained \nthat a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to Section 3553(a)(5)\u2019s re-\nquirement to consider various \u201c\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of \nthe Sentencing Commission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose \na revocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned by \nthe original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the conduct that \nviolated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals additionally stated that the view that \nSection 3583(e) lists the only permissible factors that may inform \na revocation term was \u201cunworkable in another way\u201d:  Section 3583(c) \nincludes the same set of factors that are listed in Section 3583(e) \nas considerations for a district court in initially imposing a \nterm of supervised release at a defendant\u2019s original sentencing.  \nPet. App. 6a, 9a; see id. at 8a (observing that \u201cEsteras claims \nthat [Section] 3583(c) and (e) create a divide between permitted \nand forbidden supervised-release considerations\u201d).  The court \nstated that \u201cCongress could not have expected courts\u201d at an initial \nsentencing \u201cto wipe their minds of\u201d more expansive sentencing \n\u201cconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, \nand nothing in the statute requires such compartmentalization.\u201d  \nId. at 9a-10a. \nFinally, the court of appeals observed that its \u201cunderstand-\ning of [Section] 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other \n\n9 \n \ncircuits and the outcomes of all of them.\u201d  Pet. App. 11a.  The \ncourt explained that the \u201cgeneral rule is that courts may invoke \nfactors related to the three general considerations in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sen-\ntence,\u201d and that the circuits that have \u201cdescribed the [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still \nrecognize that they may play supporting roles in a district court\u2019s \nanalysis,\u201d such that \u201c[e]ven under these decisions,\u201d the district \ncourt here \u201cacted properly.\u201d  Id. at 11a-12a. \nc. \nOn the same day that the panel issued its amended order, \nthe court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  Pet. App. 19a-29a.  \nJudge Moore dissented from the denial, on the view that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 21a-27a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehearing was warranted, but \ndid not state that the panel had erred.  Id. at 28a-29a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition for re-\nhearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  Pet. App. 30a-34a.  Judge \nMoore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated her belief that the panel \ndecision was incorrect.  Id. at 32a.  Judge Griffin, joined by \nJudges Stranch and Bloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing \nwas warranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  Id. \nat 33a-34a. \n2. \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police of-\nficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun under his \n\n10 \n \nseat with three (15-, 20- and 30-round-capacity) magazines con-\ntaining 21 rounds of ammunition.  1:19-cr-283 D. Ct. Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 7-\n14 (Dec. 23, 2019) (Presentence Investigation Report).  Leaks \npleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  Pet. App. \n74a.  The district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of impris-\nonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks began serving his term of supervised \nrelease.  23-3547 Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including a state unlawful-firearm-\npossession offense and a state robbery offense to which Leaks had \npleaded guilty and had been sentenced, respectively, to three years \nand four to six years of imprisonment.  Pet. App. 74a, 80a-81a.  \nLeaks subsequently admitted to committing five supervised-release \nviolations: the two state-law crimes just noted, failing to report \nfor supervision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work towards a GED.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a.  The district \ncourt accordingly found that Leaks had violated the terms of his \nsupervised release.  Id. at 81a.  Leaks then acknowledged through \ncounsel that \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute to impose a \nterm of imprisonment\u201d given \u201cthe nature of [Leaks\u2019s] violation\u201d \nbut requested that the court run the term of imprisonment concur-\n\n11 \n \nrent with, not consecutive to, the state-court sentences for his \nstate-law violations.  Id. at 82a. \nBefore making its supervised-release revocation determina-\ntion, the district court noted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] \noffense\u201d for which supervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine \ngun\u201d and that Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The court also noted that Leaks had \ncommitted a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on supervised release.  \nIbid.  And the court agreed with \u201call of the statements made by \n[government counsel],\u201d ibid., who had noted that Sentencing Guide-\nline 7B1.3(f) required a consecutive term of imprisonment, id. at \n83a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018).  The court added \nthat \u201c[c]oncurrent time\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot \npunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  The \ncourt then imposed a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of im-\nprisonment to be served \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served \nin the two state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised release \nto follow the imprisonment.  Ibid.; see id. at 76a. \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration of pun-\nishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecifically omits\u201d that \nSection 3553(a)(2) factor from considerations.  Pet. App. 82a, \n86a.  The court acknowledged that objection.  Id. at 86a. \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals subsequently affirmed, noting that Leaks \nhad \u201cacknowledge[d] that his argument is foreclosed by United \nStates v. Lewis, [supra].\u201d  Pet. App. 74a-75a. \n3. \nFrom 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly known as \nTimothy Watters), transported cocaine and marijuana from Texas and \nMichigan to Ohio, where he distributed the drugs.  3:10-cr-4 \nPresentence Investigation Report \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (report for Timothy M. \nWatters dated Nov. 20, 2013).  After a federal grand jury indicted \nhim on federal drug charges, Jaimez pleaded guilty to conspiring \nto possess cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with intent to \ndistribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  3:10-\ncr-4 Judgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 3:10-cr-4 Indictment.  The \ndistrict court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by five years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Judg-\nment 2-3. \nAfter he started that term of supervised release, \u201cJaimez \nused drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully \ndisclose financial information to his probation officer.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 54a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s \nsupervised release and imposed a 14-month term of imprisonment, to \nbe followed by three years of supervised release.  3:10-cr-4 Order \n(Sept. 5, 2019). \nAfter Jaimez started his second term of supervised release, \nhe returned to drug dealing.  Pet. App. 54a.  Police officers found \n\n13 \n \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from \nhis original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at Jaimez\u2019s properties, \npolice found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug press.\u201d  \nIbid.  Based on that conduct, Jaimez was convicted in Ohio state \ncourt of attempting to transport marijuana.  Ibid. \nIn 2022, the Probation Office reported to the district court \nthat Jaimez had committed multiple supervised-release violations, \nincluding drug trafficking, associating with a convicted felon, \nand possessing drug paraphernalia.  3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022).  The court held a revocation hearing.  3:10-\ncr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381 (Mar. 27, 2023) (transcript).  Jaimez admitted \ncommitting those three violations, and the court accordingly found \nthat Jaimez had violated the terms of his supervised release.  Pet. \nApp. 59a.  The court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release and im-\nposed a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of imprisonment, to be \nfollowed by six years of supervised release.  Ibid.; see id. at \n54a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto protect \nthe public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of compliance of the terms \nand conditions,\u201d and to foster \u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic \ndeterrence.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \n\u201cnow twice\u201d shown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of \nsupervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of Jaimez \nand his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \u201cgarbage bag\u201d con-\n\n14 \n \ntaining \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of marijuana illustrated that Jaimez \nwas \u201cpaying no attention\u201d to those conditions.  Id. at 62a-63a.  \nThe court stated that the revocation term would emphasize to Jaimez \nand \u201cthe public generally\u201d that such conditions are mandatory and \nthat violating them means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  Ibid.  The court added that \nthe term of imprisonment was \u201ca just and deserved sanction\u201d that \nwas \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to get [Jaimez\u2019s] \nattention\u201d and would hopefully \u201cenhance respect for the law\u201d by \nshowing that compliance with supervised-release conditions is \n\u201cyour only option.\u201d  Id. at 65a-66a.  Jaimez did not lodge any \nobjection to the factors that the court had considered.  Id. at \n67a-71a; see 3:10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 381, at 57-60. \nThe court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 53a-58a.  The court \nrejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly \nrelied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors by considering \u201cthe se-\nriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, \nand the provision of just punishment.\u201d  Id. at 55a.  The court \nbased its decision on its prior decisions in petitioner Esteras\u2019s \ncase and in Lewis.  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 16-20) that the district courts \nerred by considering factors in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- \u201cthe \nseriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law,\u201d \n\n15 \n \nand \u201cprovid[ing] just punishment for the offense\u201d -- when revoking \ntheir supervised release and ordering imprisonment.  Petitioners \nfurther contend (Pet. 12-16) that the decisions below implicate a \ndivision of authority warranting review.  Those contentions lack \nmerit.  Section 3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court consider certain \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a) before revoking supervised re-\nlease and ordering reimprisonment did not require that the district \ncourts wholly disregard those other factors irrespective of their \nrelevance to the factors that Section 3583(e) expressly cross-\nreferences.  Any modest disagreement among the courts of appeals \non the question presented has no practical effect and would not \nchange the result of petitioners\u2019 cases, in which the district \ncourts briefly referred to the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors while \nconsidering undisputedly permissible factors. \nThis Court has repeatedly denied review in other cases pre-\nsenting this question, including the earlier Sixth Circuit deci-\nsion relied upon by the courts below.  See Lewis v. United States, \n555 U.S. 813 (2008) (No. 07-1295); see also, e.g., Jones v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2692 (No. 18-7857); Clay v. United States, 574 \nU.S. 1080 (2015) (No. 14-6010); Overton v. United States, 565 U.S. \n1063 (2011) (No. 11-5408); Young v. United States, 565 U.S. 863 \n(2011) (No. 10-11026).  The same result is warranted here. \n1. \nSection 3583(e) provides in pertinent part that a dis-\ntrict court may revoke supervised release and reimprison a defen-\n\n16 \n \ndant \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  Although Section 3583(e) \ndoes not cross-reference 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A) -- which describes \nthe need for a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for \nthe offense\u201d (ibid.) -- nothing in Section 3583(e) precludes con-\nsideration of those factors when the district court deems them \nrelevant. \na. \nThe \u201cenumeration in [Section] 3583(e) of specified sub-\nsections of [Section] 3553(a) that a court must consider in re-\nvoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into \naccount any other pertinent factor.\u201d  United States v. Young, 634 \nF.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.) (emphasis omitted), cert. denied, 565 U.S. \n863 (2011).  Section 3583(e)\u2019s cross-reference to specific provi-\nsions of Section 3553(a) reflects a legislative judgment that the \nfactors listed in those provisions are the only factors that a \ncourt must consider.  But as the court of appeals recognized, the \nomission of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s factors from the list of man-\ndatory factors does not mean that any reference to the seriousness \nof the underlying offense, promoting respect for the law, or \nproviding just punishment is automatically erroneous.  See Pet. \nApp. 8a (emphasizing that Section 3583 \u201cnever says that the court \n\n17 \n \nmay consider \u2018only\u2019 [the listed] factors\u201d) (citation omitted); see \nalso, e.g., Young, 634 F.3d at 239. \nNothing in Section 3583(e) requires district courts to wholly \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, including the federal \ncrimes underlying the original imposition of the supervised re-\nlease that is being revoked, see Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 701 (2000), when determining an appropriate postrevoca-\ntion penalty.  As a practical matter, the factors listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) overlap substantially with the ones listed in the \nprovisions of Section 3553(a) that Section 3583(e) expressly \ncross-references.  The cross-referenced provisions require con-\nsideration of, among other factors, \u201cthe nature and circumstances \nof the offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defend-\nant,\u201d the need to \u201cafford adequate deterrence,\u201d and the need to \n\u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), and (C).  Effective consideration of \nthose factors will often require some recognition of the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  It is hard to \u201csee how\u201d a district court \n\u201ccould possibly ignore\u201d the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors --  \nincluding \u201cthe seriousness of the offense\u201d -- while evaluating, \nfor example, the need for \u201c\u2018adequate deterrence,\u2019\u201d the objective \nof protecting \u201cthe public from \u2018further crimes of the defendant,\u2019\u201d \nand \u201c\u2018the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u2019\u201d  United States \nv. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\n18 \n \n3553(a)(1), (2)(B) and (C)); see United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d \n393, 400 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[T]he three considerations in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) * * * are essentially redundant with matters \ncourts are already permitted to take into consideration when im-\nposing sentences for violation of supervised release.\u201d), cert. \ndenied, 555 U.S. 813 (2008). \nThe district courts\u2019 approaches here did not violate Section \n3583(e).  In Esteras\u2019s case, the district court referred to the \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, Pet. App. 48a, but it considered \nother indisputably permissible factors, emphasizing in particular \nthe need to deter Esteras from future misconduct and to protect \nthe public.  See p. 5, supra; see also Pet. App. 12a-13a.  In \nLeaks\u2019s case, the district court briefly referred to Leaks\u2019s un-\nderlying firearms offense, but it did so in the context of con-\nsidering his supervised-release violations -- which likewise in-\nvolved firearms -- and the court ultimately determined that the \nSentencing Guidelines themselves called for consecutive terms of \nimprisonment.  See p. 11, supra.  And in Jaimez\u2019s case, the dis-\ntrict court emphasized that the \u201creasons\u201d for its revocation order \nwere factors that Section 3583(e) required the court to consider: \nthe need to adequately \u201cdeter[]\u201d criminal misconduct and \u201cprotect \nthe public.\u201d  Pet. App. 64a-65a; see pp. 13-14, supra; see also 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C).  While the court referred briefly to \nJaimez\u2019s \u201cprior criminal record,\u201d and the need to enhance \u201crespect \n\n19 \n \nfor the law,\u201d Pet. App. 65a, it was required to consider Jaimez\u2019s \nbackground and history, see 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), and \u201crespect for \nthe law\u201d goes hand-in-hand with deterrence. \nb. \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 16-17) on this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011), is mis-\nplaced.  The question in Tapia was whether a district court could \nproperly consider the need for rehabilitation when imposing a term \nof imprisonment in an initial sentencing despite the statement in \n18 U.S.C. 3582(a) that \u201cimprisonment is not an appropriate means \nof promoting correction and rehabilitation.\u201d  The Court relied on \nthe plain meaning of that statutory language to conclude that the \nsentencing court could not consider rehabilitation.  564 U.S. at \n326-327.  No similar statutory language prohibits consideration of \nthe factors specified in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) at a supervised-\nrelease revocation proceeding.  Indeed, as Tapia and Section \n3582(a) illustrate, Congress knows how to clearly prohibit consi-\nderation of a sentencing factor, see ibid., but Congress did not \ndo so in Section 3583(e). \nIn describing the statutory background, Tapia stated that \u201ca \ncourt may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed \nin \u00a7 3553(a)(2) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  564 \nU.S. at 326.  Petitioners do not suggest that that the Court\u2019s \nstatement on that point constitutes a holding, see Pet. 16-17, and \nthe Court in any event referred only to the \u201cimposi[tion]\u201d of \n\n20 \n \nsupervised release, Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326, not to revocation of \nsupervised release or an order of reimprisonment -- the proceedings \nat issue here. \n2. \nPetitioners assert (Pet. 12-15) that the court of ap-\npeals are divided about whether a district court may consider the \nfactors listed in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in revoking supervised \nrelease and ordering reimprisonment under Section 3583(e).  Like \nother petitioners who have unsuccessfully raised this question, \ne.g., Jones, supra; Clay, supra, petitioners substantially over-\nstate the extent of any disagreement in the circuits.  And, as in \nthose previous cases, any modest disagreement has little practical \neffect and does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.  See p. 15, supra. \na. \nThe majority of circuits that have addressed the issue, \nincluding the court below, have correctly determined that Section \n3583(e)\u2019s directive that a court revoking supervised release and \nordering reimprisonment must consider factors enumerated in par-\nticular provisions of Section 3553(a) does not mean that a court \nmay not consider other pertinent factors.  See, e.g., United States \nv. Vargas-D\u00e1vila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (observing \nthat Section 3583(e) \u201cdoes not forbid consideration of other per-\ntinent section 3553(a) factors\u201d); Young, 634 F.3d at 239; Williams, \n443 F.3d at 47 (observing that Section 3583 does not \u201cforbid[] \nconsideration of other pertinent factors\u201d); see also United States \nv. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (observing that a \n\n21 \n \ndistrict court may consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A) so long as it \n\u201crelies primarily on the factors\u201d in Section 3583(e)), cert. de-\nnied, 574 U.S. 1080 (2015); United States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, \n641 (4th Cir. 2013) (joining \u201cmany of our sister circuits\u201d on this \nissue). \nb. \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 12-13) that the Fourth, Fifth, \nNinth, and Tenth Circuits support their position. \nAs to the Fourth Circuit, petitioners cite (Pet. 12) only \nUnited States v. Crudup, 461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir. 2006), cert. \ndenied, 549 U.S. 1283 (2007), which ultimately affirmed a revoca-\ntion term.  And the nondispositive discussion of the issue in \nCrudup has since been superseded by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s direct \nconsideration of the issue in United States v. Webb, as cited \nabove. \nThe Fifth Circuit has stated \u201cthat it is improper for a dis-\ntrict court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or \nrevocation of a supervised release term.\u201d  United States v. Miller, \n634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 976 (2011).  \nBut the Fifth Circuit did not grant relief to the defendant in \nMiller, ibid., and subsequent decisions of that court (albeit in \nunpublished orders) illustrate that any marginal difference be-\ntween its standard and that of other courts of appeals makes little \npractical difference. \n\n22 \n \nFor example, in United States v. Zamarripa, 517 Fed. Appx. \n264 (2013) (per curiam), the Fifth Circuit rejected a claim that \na district court had violated Miller, distinguishing \u201cproperly \n[considering] the nature and circumstances of the original of-\nfense\u201d from \u201cintend[ing] improperly that the sentence reflect the \nseriousness of or impose just punishment for the original offense.\u201d  \nId. at 265; see United States v. Jones, 538 Fed. Appx. 505, 508 \n(5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (rejecting Miller claim).  Petitioners \nthus fail to show that the Fifth Circuit would have resolved their \ncases differently.  And as noted above, this Court denied review \nin Miller and has denied review in subsequent cases presenting the \nsame question. \nThe Ninth Circuit has taken a slightly different approach.  \nIn United States v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173 (2006), that court con-\ncluded that a district court revoking supervised release erred by \nfailing to set forth sufficient reasons for ordering a term of \nreimprisonment outside the recommended guidelines range.  Id. at \n1177-1179.  In providing guidance for the district court on remand, \nthe Ninth Circuit stated that because \u201c[Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) is \na factor that Congress deliberately omitted from the list appli-\ncable to revocation sentencing, relying on that factor when im-\nposing a revocation sentence would be improper.\u201d  Id. at 1182.  \nThe Ninth Circuit then explained, however, that consideration of \nthe factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) would contravene Section \n\n23 \n \n3583(e) only if reliance on those facts was \u201ca primary basis for \na revocation sentence.\u201d  Ibid.  (emphasis added). \nFor example, the Ninth Circuit explained, a \u201cmere reference \nto promoting respect for the law\u201d would not itself \u201crender a sen-\ntence unreasonable.\u201d  Miqbel, 444 F.3d at 1182.  In keeping with \nthat understanding, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that Miqbel \n\u201cdid not set forth a blanket proposition that a court in no cir-\ncumstances may consider the seriousness of the criminal offense \nunderlying the revocation,\u201d but merely explained that this con-\nsideration should not be the primary \u201cfoc[us]\u201d of an order of \nreimprisonment following revocation.  United States v. Simtob, 485 \nF.3d 1058, 1062 (2007).  Petitioners have thus failed to show that \ntheir cases would have been resolved differently under Miqbel. \nFinally, the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Booker, 63 \nF.4th 1254 (10th Cir. 2023), concluded that a district court may \nnot \u201crevoke a term of supervised release based on the need for \nretribution,\u201d on the theory that Section 3583(e) \u201c\u2018implicitly for-\nbids\u2019\u201d consideration of \u201cthe retribution factor found in [Section] \n3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d  Id. at 1256, 1259-1260; see id. at 1258-1262.  \nBut the Booker panel ultimately affirmed the district court on the \nground that any erroneous invocation of a Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactor in the case could not satisfy the plain-error standard of \nreview.  Id. at 1262-1264.  The panel observed that the revocation \ncourt made only a \u201csingle impermissible reference\u201d to Section \n\n24 \n \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, and that such a reference was insufficient \nto demonstrate that it made any difference to the resulting term \nof imprisonment.  Id. at 1263. \nAs such, the ultimate result in Booker -- affirmance -- does \nnot conflict with the results reached here.  And after Booker, the \nTenth Circuit has declined to infer that a revocation term of \nimprisonment was impermissibly grounded in retribution where the \ndistrict court did not clearly indicate as much.  See United States \nv. Kearse, No. 23-1071, 2024 WL 488391, at *3-*6 (10th Cir. Feb. \n8, 2024) (unpublished).  The court has also repeatedly affirmed \nrevocation terms of imprisonment based on a Booker error on plain-\nerror review.  See United States v. Kratz, No. 22-5089, 2023 WL \n3035195, at *7-*9 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 2023) (unpublished); United \nStates v. Waffle, No. 22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480, at *2-*4 (10th \nCir. Apr. 17, 2023) (unpublished). \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR \n  Solicitor General \n \nNICOLE M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been consolidated and my next objective clarified. The core legal and factual basis of the case remains stable, but my internal model of the arguments and remaining uncertainties is now more sharply defined.\n\n*   **Established Facts & Legal Question (Stable):** The facts concerning Edgardo Esteras's supervised release violation, the subsequent sentence imposed by Judge Pearson, and the Sixth Circuit's affirmation are unchanged. The legal question remains: Can a district court consider the punitive factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when imposing a sentence for a supervised release violation under \u00a7 3583(e)?\n\n*   **Petitioner's Argument Model (Confirmed & Stable):** My model of the petitioner's case, built from their merits brief, is confirmed as the current foundation of my knowledge. It rests on four pillars:\n    1.  **Textualism (*Expressio Unius*):** Congress included punitive factors in other sentencing statutes but omitted them from \u00a7 3583(e), implying preclusion.\n    2.  **Legislative History & Purpose:** Supervised release was designed as a rehabilitative, post-punishment tool, not a vehicle for additional punishment for the original crime.\n    3.  **Constitutional Avoidance:** Allowing punishment at a revocation hearing (which has lower procedural safeguards) raises Sixth Amendment concerns (*United States v. Haymond*).\n    4.  **Precedent (*Tapia v. United States*):** The situation is analogous to *Tapia*, where the Court forbade lengthening a sentence for the omitted purpose of rehabilitation.\n\n*   **Central Conflict & Prediction (Stable but Articulated):** The conflict remains a clash between the petitioner's preclusion argument and the government's anticipated position that the \u00a7 3583(e) factors are permissive and intertwined with punitive aims. My tentative prediction of **Reversal** in favor of Esteras is stable. The latest observation (the agent's internal thought process) does not introduce new evidence to change this but confirms that this prediction is contingent and based on an incomplete, one-sided argument.\n\n*   **Key Uncertainty (Explicitly Identified):** The most significant gap in my task-level knowledge has been formally identified and prioritized. My model is critically incomplete without the **Respondent's (United States) counter-arguments**. I must discover:\n    *   How does the government rebut the *expressio unius* textualist argument?\n    *   How do they distinguish the facts or reasoning of *Tapia v. United States*?\n    *   What is their interpretation of the purpose of supervised release and the interplay between factors like deterrence, public safety, and punishment?\n    *   How do they address the constitutional avoidance argument?\n    The Brief for the Respondents is now confirmed as the document with the highest Expected Information Gain.",
          "design_beliefs": "The latest observation, an act of pure self-reflection, provides powerful validation for my meta-cognitive strategies and introduces a new, explicit layer to my methodology: the deliberate act of pausing to synthesize knowledge and plan the next move.\n\n*   **Validated Core Strategies:**\n    *   **\"The Reflective Loop\" (Strongly Validated & Formalized):** This observation is the embodiment of the \"diagnose\" and \"design\" phases of the loop. The act of `THINK`ing\u2014pausing to summarize the current knowledge state, identify the largest uncertainty, and plan the next action\u2014is now formalized as a critical, discrete step in the process. It's not just something that happens implicitly; it is an action unto itself.\n    *   **\"Model-Balancing\" (Confirmed):** The reflection explicitly states the goal is to \"balance my model,\" confirming this as a primary driver for information-gathering.\n    *   **\"Broaden, then Filter\" (Stable):** This tactical approach for finding documents remains a proven method.\n\n*   **New & Evolving Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Strategic Synthesis & Planning\" (New Heuristic):** The `THINK` action itself represents a new, high-level heuristic. It involves periodically pausing the search for external data to perform an internal synthesis. The steps are: 1) Summarize the current belief state (\u03b8). 2) Explicitly identify the largest remaining area of uncertainty or the most significant gap in the model. 3) Formulate the next action based on the principle of maximizing Expected Information Gain (EIG) to address that specific uncertainty. This prevents inefficient or redundant information gathering.\n    *   **\"Argument Structure Analysis\" (Stable):** The heuristic of parsing a brief's `TABLE OF CONTENTS` and `SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT` first remains a high-value tactic for rapid model building.\n    *   **\"Precedent Triangulation\" (Stable):** The heuristic of identifying and focusing on cornerstone precedents like *Tapia* is confirmed as a key method for understanding the legal battleground.\n    *   **\"Metadata-Driven Targeting\" (Stable):** The refined search tactic of using metadata from one document to find another remains a core part of my advanced search capability.\n\n*   **Source Reliability Hierarchy (Stable & Confirmed):** The hierarchy remains unchanged, but the value of merits briefs is reinforced. The current state of knowledge demonstrates how a single brief can fundamentally shape the entire model of a case, while also highlighting its own insufficiency without the opposing view.\n    1.  **SCOTUS Oral Argument Transcript**\n    2.  **Merits Briefs (Petitioner & Respondent)**\n    3.  **Table of Contents / Table of Authorities** (High-value sub-sources within briefs)\n    4.  **Circuit Court Merits Opinion**\n    5.  **Procedural Filings** (Valuable as metadata sources)"
