    "facts_of_the_case": "A.J.T., a student with epilepsy, experiences seizures so severe in the morning that she cannot attend school until noon. Her parents repeatedly requested evening instruction from Osseo Area Schools to give her a school day length more comparable to her peers. Despite the District providing some accommodations, including one-on-one instruction, a slightly extended school day, and summer home instruction sessions, they denied the requests for evening instruction. The District\u2019s Director of Student Services, responsible for Section 504 compliance, was unaware of the parents\u2019 complaints and did not know that District policies allowed at-home schooling as an accommodation. A.J.T., through her parents, sued the District for disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the District, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.",

It prioritizes the single most important document at this stage\u2014the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\u2014which contains the petitioner's arguments, the question presented, and the justification for Supreme Court review (often a circuit split). This plan dramatically increases the expected value of all subsequent actions.\n\nDesign EIG is very high (0.9) because the strategy outlined is a canonical and highly generalizable workflow for analyzing any SCOTUS case at the certiorari stage. Identifying the core question, starting with the petition, looking for a circuit split, and planning to understand both sides' arguments is a fundamental and reusable methodology. Internalizing this process is a significant gain in understanding how to perform this class of tasks effectively.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action establishes a strong foundation for both the specific task and general strategic competence.",

The proposed action\u2014retrieving the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\u2014is the single most valuable next step. \n\nTask EIG is extremely high (0.95) because the petition is the foundational document that will move my understanding from a general summary to the specific, nuanced legal arguments the petitioner is presenting to the Court. It will detail their interpretation of the statutes, and most critically, it will explicitly lay out the argument for a circuit split, which is a primary driver for the Court granting review. This document directly addresses the key information gaps I have identified and will cause a massive update to my belief state about the strength and framing of the petitioner's case.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action reinforces a cornerstone of SCOTUS prediction methodology: begin with the cert petition. Executing this step and analyzing its output refines my internal model for how to approach any new case. I will learn to more effectively parse petitions for key predictive signals like the nature of the circuit split, the framing of the 'Question Presented,' and the arguments about the case's national importance. This is a highly generalizable and fundamental procedural insight.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action is maximally informative for both the specific prediction task and for refining my overall predictive strategy.",

In the decision below, the Eighth Circuit \nheld that, for discrimination claims \u201cbased on \neducational services\u201d brought by children with \ndisabilities, these statutes are violated only if school \nofficials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nApp.3a. \nThat test squarely implicates an entrenched and \nacknowledged 5-2 circuit split over the standard \ngoverning such claims.  It is also plainly mistaken on \nthe \nmerits: \n \nAs \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nitself \nacknowledged, the test lacks \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext,\u201d App.5a n.2, and it arbitrarily departs from the \nmore lenient standards that all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014apply to ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (App.44a-45a) is not published, but \navailable at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota granting Osseo Area Schools\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment (App.6a-43a) is not published but \navailable at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on \nMarch 21, 2024 (App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe petition appendix.  App.46a-48a. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case once again raises a frequently recurring \nquestion of exceptional importance for children with \ndisabilities \nseeking \nto \nvindicate \ntheir \nfederal \nstatutory rights against discrimination.  As in Perez \nv. Sturgis Public Schools, 598 U.S. 142 (2023), \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas County School \nDistrict RE-1, 580 U.S. 386 (2017), and Fry v. \nNapoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154 (2017), \nthis Court should grant certiorari to resolve deep \ndivisions in the lower courts and enforce the plain \nterms of key statutes protecting vulnerable children \nfrom discrimination by their schools. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under Title II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \ncan \nobtain \ninjunctive \nrelief \nwithout \nproving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But the Eighth Circuit and \nfour other circuits have erected a more stringent test \nfor children with disabilities who face discrimination \nin the school setting.  Those plaintiffs\u2014and only those \nplaintiffs\u2014must prove that school officials acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain any kind \nof relief.  App.5a n.2.     \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s test has absolutely no basis \nin the relevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor \nthe Rehabilitation Act requires \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d or authorizes courts to apply a \nuniquely stringent standard to children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, Congress mandated that \u201cany person\u201d \nseeking relief under those statutes would have the \n\n3 \n \n \nsame rights and remedies as those available under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act, which makes no \ndistinction \nbetween \nschoolchildren \nand \nother \nplaintiffs.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s atextual approach also \nimplicates a deep circuit split.  Whereas the  Second, \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have adopted the \nEighth \nCircuit\u2019s \nasymmetric \ninterpretation \ndisfavoring children with disabilities, the Third and \nNinth Circuits apply the same standards to those \nchildren as they do to all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  Indeed, the circuit split \nhas been acknowledged by multiple federal courts\u2014\nas well as by the respondents here. \nBelow, an Eighth Circuit panel rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d), a teenage girl who suffers from severe \nepilepsy.  The panel expressly acknowledged that Ava \nhad presented evidence showing that her Minnesota \nschool \ndistrict \nhad \nbeen \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in refusing reasonable \naccommodations that her prior Kentucky school \ndistrict had provided for years.  App.3a.  Nonetheless, \nthe panel rejected her claims because it was \n\u201cconstrained\u201d by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s prior decision in \nMonahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), \nwhich \nfirst \nestablished \nthe \nbad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard.  App.4a-5a.  In the Third and \nNinth Circuits, Ava\u2019s evidence would have been \nsufficient to survive summary judgment.  But in the \nEighth Circuit\u2014and in the four other circuits \nembracing Monahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard\u2014\n\u201cthat\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n\n4 \n \n \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit panel sharply \ncriticized Monahan for jacking up the standard for \nschoolchildren to bring disability claims.  The panel \nobserved that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act was \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text\u201d and built instead on misguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own circuit precedent applying \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims\u2014and to \nno one else.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023).  After Ava filed an en banc petition \nasking the Eighth Circuit to overrule Monahan, \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented from the \ndenial of rehearing.   \nThis case presents an exceptionally important \nissue for children with disabilities and their families.  \nBoth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provide \nmuch-needed relief for educational discrimination, \nwhich often has life-altering consequences for \nchildren with disabilities.  Yet as this case illustrates, \nthe atextual rule imposed in five circuits makes it far \nharder for them to prove their claims\u2014for no good \nreason.  That has real consequences:  Literally \nhundreds of decisions have relied on Monahan (or its \nequivalent in other circuits) to deny relief to children \nlike Ava. \nOnly this Court can resolve the circuit split and \nrestore the full measure of protection that Congress \nguaranteed to vulnerable children with disabilities.  \nThe petition should be granted.   \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA)\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at \n158 (citations omitted).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nspeedily resolving IEP-related disputes between \nfamilies and schools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows \ncourts to award only \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 16 \n(1993).  Such relief may include an injunction, see id., \nor \u201creimburse[ment]\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protection.  As relevant here, the ADA \nprovides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct contains a similarly phrased prohibition that \n\n6 \n \n \napplies to recipients of federal funding.  See 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794(a).  Unlike the IDEA, which concerns only \nschool-age children with respect to their education, \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprotect \nall \nAmericans, both inside and outside the school setting. \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nto people with disabilities that would enable them to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program \nconstitutes disability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 170.  Accommodations are reasonable so long as \nthey do not entail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the \nservice in question or cause \u201cundue financial or \nadm\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In the decision below, the Eighth Circuit \nheld that, for discrimination claims \u201cbased on \neducational services\u201d brought by children with \ndisabilities, these statutes are violated only if school \nofficials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nApp.3a. \nThat test squarely implicates an entrenched and \nacknowledged 5-2 circuit split over the standard \ngoverning such claims.  It is also plainly mistaken on \nthe \nmerits: \n \nAs \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nitself \nacknowledged, the test lacks \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext,\u201d App.5a n.2, and it arbitrarily departs from the \nmore lenient standards that all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014apply to ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe petition appendix.  App.46a-48a. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case once again raises a frequently recurring \nquestion of exceptional importance for children with \ndisabilities \nseeking \nto \nvindicate \ntheir \nfederal \nstatutory rights against discrimination.  As in Perez \nv. Sturgis Public Schools, 598 U.S. 142 (2023), \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas County School \nDistrict RE-1, 580 U.S. 386 (2017), and Fry v. \nNapoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154 (2017), \nthis Court should grant certiorari to resolve deep \ndivisions in the lower courts and enforce the plain \nterms of key statutes protecting vulnerable children \nfrom discrimination by their schools. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under Title II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \ncan \nobtain \ninjunctive \nrelief \nwithout \nproving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But the Eighth Circuit and \nfour other circuits have erected a more stringent test \nfor children with disabilities who face discrimination \nin the school setting.  Those plaintiffs\u2014and only those \nplaintiffs\u2014must prove that school officials acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain any kind \nof relief.  App.5a n.2.     \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s test has absolutely no basis \nin the relevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor \nthe Rehabilitation Act requires \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d or authorizes courts to apply a \nuniquely stringent standard to children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, Congress mandated that \u201cany person\u201d \nseeking relief under those statutes would have the \n\n3 \n \n \nsame rights and remedies as those available under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act, which makes no \ndistinction \nbetween \nschoolchildren \nand \nother \nplaintiffs.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s atextual approach also \nimplicates a deep circuit split.  Whereas the  Second, \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have adopted the \nEighth \nCircuit\u2019s \nasymmetric \ninterpretation \ndisfavoring children with disabilities, the Third and \nNinth Circuits apply the same standards to those \nchildren as they do to all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  Indeed, the circuit split \nhas been acknowledged by multiple federal courts\u2014\nas well as by the respondents here. \nBelow, an Eighth Circuit panel rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d), a teenage girl who suffers from severe \nepilepsy.  The panel expressly acknowledged that Ava \nhad presented evidence showing that her Minnesota \nschool \ndistrict \nhad \nbeen \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in refusing reasonable \naccommodations that her prior Kentucky school \ndistrict had provided for years.  App.3a.  Nonetheless, \nthe panel rejected her claims because it was \n\u201cconstrained\u201d by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s prior decision in \nMonahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), \nwhich \nfirst \nestablished \nthe \nbad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard.  App.4a-5a.  In the Third and \nNinth Circuits, Ava\u2019s evidence would have been \nsufficient to survive summary judgment.  But in the \nEighth Circuit\u2014and in the four other circuits \nembracing Monahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard\u2014\n\u201cthat\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n\n4 \n \n \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit panel sharply \ncriticized Monahan for jacking up the standard for \nschoolchildren to bring disability claims.  The panel \nobserved that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act was \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text\u201d and built instead on misguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own circuit precedent applying \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims\u2014and to \nno one else.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023).  After Ava filed an en banc petition \nasking the Eighth Circuit to overrule Monahan, \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented from the \ndenial of rehearing.   \nThis case presents an exceptionally important \nissue for children with disabilities and their families.  \nBoth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provide \nmuch-needed relief for educational discrimination, \nwhich often has life-altering consequences for \nchildren with disabilities.  Yet as this case illustrates, \nthe atextual rule imposed in five circuits makes it far \nharder for them to prove their claims\u2014for no good \nreason.  That has real consequences:  Literally \nhundreds of decisions have relied on Monahan (or its \nequivalent in other circuits) to deny relief to children \nlike Ava. \nOnly this Court can resolve the circuit split and \nrestore the full measure of protection that Congress \nguaranteed to vulnerable children with disabilities.  \nThe petition should be granted.   \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA)\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at \n158 (citations omitted).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nspeedily resolving IEP-related disputes between \nfamilies and schools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows \ncourts to award only \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 16 \n(1993).  Such relief may include an injunction, see id., \nor \u201creimburse[ment]\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protection.  As relevant here, the ADA \nprovides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct contains a similarly phrased prohibition that \n\n6 \n \n \napplies to recipients of federal funding.  See 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794(a).  Unlike the IDEA, which concerns only \nschool-age children with respect to their education, \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprotect \nall \nAmericans, both inside and outside the school setting. \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nto people with disabilities that would enable them to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program \nconstitutes disability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 170.  Accommodations are reasonable so long as \nthey do not entail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the \nservice in question or cause \u201cundue financial or \nadministrative burdens.\u201d  Gorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d \n907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted); see also \nK.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin Unified Sch. Dist., 725 \nF.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2013).   \n2. The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cexpressly \nincorporate[]\u201d the same set of \u201crights and remedies \nprovided under Title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964.  Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., \n596 U.S. 212, 218 (2022); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nthus follow Title VI in \u201cauthoriz[ing] individuals,\u201d \nincluding children with disabilities, \u201cto seek redress \nfor violations\u201d by \u201cbringing suits\u201d not just \u201cfor \ninjunctive relief,\u201d but also for \u201cmoney damages.\u201d  Fry, \n580 U.S. at 160; see also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 278-80 (2001) (observing that \u201cprivate \nindividuals may sue\u201d under \u201cTitle VI and obtain both \ninjunctive relief and damages\u201d). \n \nIn cases outside the educational context, the \ncourts \nof \nappeals \nagree \nthat \nall \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs are eligible for injunctive \nrelief if they show, on the merits, that the defendant \n\n7 \n \n \nfailed to provide a reasonable accommodation to a \ncovered person with a disability.  Such plaintiffs need \nnot make any specific showing of wrongful intent to \nobtain such relief.1   \nFor compensatory damages, however, every circuit \nrequires \u201ca showing of intent[].\u201d  S.H. ex rel. Durrell \nv. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 262 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  Because \u201cprivate \nindividuals [may] not recover compensatory damages \nunder Title VI except for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83, and because the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nexpressly \nincorporate \nTitle VI\u2019s rights and rights, supra at 6, people with \ndisabilities may not obtain damages under the ADA \nor Rehabilitation Act without proving intent.  See \nS.H., 729 F.3d at 262.   \nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of courts hold that this intent \nrequirement for damages demands proof that the \ndefendant \nwas\u2014at \na \nminimum\u2014\u201cdeliberately \nindifferent\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected \nrights.  Pierce v. Dist. of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2015) (Jackson, J.) (collecting \n \n1   See Sosa v. Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Corr., 80 F.4th 15, 30 \n(1st Cir. 2023); Hamilton v. Westchester County, 3 F.4th 86, 91 \n(2d Cir. 2021); Durham v. Kelley, 82 F.4th 217, 225-26 \n(3d Cir. 2023); Richardson v. Clarke, 52 F.4th 614, 619 \n(4th Cir. 2022); Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d \n448, 455 (5th Cir. 2005); Finley v. Huss, 102 F.4th 789, 820 \n(6th Cir. 2024); Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, \n465 F.3d 737, 750-51 (7th Cir. 2006) (en banc); Hall v. Higgins, \n77 F.4th 1171, 1180-81 (8th Cir. 2023); Payan v. L.A. Cmty. Coll. \nDist., 11 F.4th 729, 738 (9th Cir. 2021); Brooks v. Colo. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr., 12 F.4th 1160, 1167 (10th Cir. 2021); Charles v. Johnson, \n18 F.4th 686, 702 (11th Cir. 2021); Chenari v. George \nWashington Univ., 847 F.3d 740, 746-47 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  \n\n8 \n \n \ncases).  Those courts have done so based on this \nCourt\u2019s precedent adopting a deliberate indifference \nstandard under Title IX, which was likewise \u201cmodeled \nafter Title VI.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n524 U.S. 274, 286, 290 (1998).2 \nAlthough the circuits largely agree on the \nstandards for applying the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct\u2019s protections outside the educational setting, they \nare intractably divided over whether those same \nstandards apply to children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims.  Two circuits\u2014the Third \nand Ninth\u2014apply the same standards in these cases \nas they do in all others.  But five circuits\u2014led by the \nEighth\u2014apply a different test.  Ever since Monahan \nv. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth \nCircuit has held that \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nmust be shown before a violation of the Rehabilitation \nAct (and thus the ADA) \u201ccan be made out\u201d in \u201cthe \ncontext of education of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. \nat 1170-71.  Since then, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and \nSixth Circuits have followed suit.  See infra at 14-20 \n(describing circuit split in greater detail). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Ever since she was six months old, Ava has \nsuffered from \u201ca rare form of epilepsy\u201d that severely \nimpacts her ability to function.  App.50a (opinion in \n \n2   See Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, \n275 (2d Cir. 2009); S.H., 729 F.3d at 263-64; Basta v. Novant \nHealth Inc., 56 F.4th 307, 316-17 (4th Cir. 2022); Lacy v. Cook \nCounty, 897 F.3d 847, 863 (7th Cir. 2018); Meagley v. City of \nLittle Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011); Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 513 F.3d 922, 938 (9th Cir. 2008); Powers v. MJB \nAcquisition Corp., 184 F.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999); \nSilberman v. Miami Dade Transit, 927 F.3d 1123, 1134 \n(11th Cir. 2019). \n\n9 \n \n \nrelated case).  Even now, as a teenager, Ava \u201crequires \nassistance with everyday tasks like walking and \ntoileting.\u201d  Id.  She has seizures that \u201care so frequent \nin the morning that she can\u2019t attend school before \nnoon.\u201d  Id.  From then on, however, \u201cshe\u2019s alert and \nable to learn until about 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id.   \n\u201cBefore moving to Minnesota in 2015,\u201d when she \nwas 10 years old, Ava\u2019s public school district in \nKentucky adequately addressed her needs, including \nby providing \u201cevening instruction at home.\u201d  Id.  But \nher Minnesota district, respondent Osseo Area \nSchools (the District), refused to accommodate her.  \nId.  \u201cYear after year, it denied [Ava\u2019s] parents\u2019 \nrequests for evening instruction\u201d based on \u201ca series of \nshifting explanations.\u201d  Id.  Initially, the District \n\u201cclaimed that state law d[id] not require\u201d adjusting \nAva\u2019s instructional hours.  Id.  Then, the District \u201csaid \nit needed to avoid setting unfavorable precedent for \nitself and other districts.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd later, it said that \nthe home environment would be too restrictive,\u201d while \ndemanding more \u201cdata\u201d to justify a \u201cprogramming \nchange.\u201d  Id.  All told, over her first three years in \nMinnesota, Ava received only 4.25 hours of \ninstruction per day\u2014more than two hours less than \nher non-disabled peers.  Id.; see id. at 8a. \nThen, in 2018, the District insisted on truncating \nAva\u2019s instructional time even further.  As Ava \nprepared to enter middle school, the District abruptly \namended her IEP to \u201ccut[] back her day to about \n3 hours\u201d\u2014less than half of what her peers would \nreceive.  App.51a; see id. at 8a.  Despite this latest \nsetback, Ava\u2019s parents continued to engage with the \nDistrict, seeking a workable compromise.  They made \n\u201cvarious proposals to at least maintain [Ava\u2019s] \n4.25-hour day,\u201d including keeping her at the \n\n10 \n \n \nelementary school, where the school day was longer.  \nId. at 51a.  The District rejected all of them.  Id.   \n2. After years of frustration, Ava\u2019s parents \n\u201c[r]ealiz[ed] that an agreement [with the District] was \nbeyond reach\u201d and filed an IDEA complaint with the \nMinnesota Department of Education.  Id.  After a \nfive-day hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) \nfound that the District had denied Ava a FAPE in \nviolation of the IDEA.   \nThe ALJ found that the District\u2019s \u201cprevailing and \nparamount consideration\u201d had never been Ava\u2019s \u201cneed \nfor instruction,\u201d but rather its own desire \u201cto maintain \nthe regular hours of the school\u2019s faculty.\u201d  CA8 \nAppellant\u2019s App. 367.  The ALJ accordingly ordered \nthe District to \u201crevise\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP to include evening \ninstruction and other services.  Id. at 368-69.  The \nALJ also ordered \u201c495 hours of compensatory \neducation instruction,\u201d limiting relief to what the ALJ \nbelieved was the proper two-year \u201climitations period\u201d \nunder the IDEA.  Id. at 366, 369. \n3. The parties then proceeded to federal court.  \nThe District challenged the ALJ\u2019s IDEA ruling.  For \nher part, Ava sued the District under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, seeking an injunction that would \n\u201cpermanently secure [Ava]\u2019s rights to a full school \nday,\u201d as well as \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d for the \nentire duration of her mistreatment.  Id. at 21-22, \n25, 28; see also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(4) (IDEA  \nprovision permitting school officials to revise IEPs \n\u201cperiodically\u201d).  By bringing these claims, Ava was \nable to take advantage of the six-year limitations \nperiod governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims \nbrought in Minnesota.  See Gaona v. Town & Country \nCredit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 (8th Cir. 2003).   \n\n11 \n \n \nThe district court upheld Ava\u2019s victory on her \nIDEA claim.  The court explained that Ava \u201crequires \nmore than 4.25 hours of schooling a day to have an \neducational program\u201d that \u201cwill allow her to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  CA8 Appellant\u2019s App. 789.  \nThe court thus agreed that \u201c[e]xtending her \ninstructional day until 6:00pm and including \ncompensatory \nhours \nof \ninstruction\u201d \nwas \n\u201cthe \nappropriate remedy\u201d under the IDEA.  Id.  \nAs to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, however, \nthe district court granted summary judgment against \nAva and in favor of the District.  The court explained \nthat, under Monahan, Ava had to show that the \nDistrict had acted with either \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  App.24a-25a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d \nat 1171.  Applying Monahan\u2019s heightened standard, \nthe district court concluded that the District\u2019s actions \n\u201cdid not rise to th[at] level.\u201d  App.30a. \n4. In two published opinions by Judge Kobes, a \npanel of the Eighth Circuit unanimously affirmed \nboth rulings.  See App.49a-57a (IDEA decision); id. at \n1a-5a (ADA and Rehabilitation Act decision). \nIn the IDEA case, the panel agreed that Ava had \nnot received a FAPE based on \u201c[s]everal\u201d facts.  Id. \nat 54a.  First, Ava had made \u201conly slight progress in \na few areas\u201d while in the District\u2019s care.  Id.  Second, \nAva \u201cregressed in toileting\u201d so drastically that the \nDistrict had \u201cremoved her toileting goal\u201d altogether, \nciting only a \u201clack of time in the short day\u2014not [a] \nlack of ability to improve.\u201d  Id. at 55a-56a.  Third, \n\u201cexpert testimony\u201d confirmed that Ava \u201cwould have \nmade more progress\u201d with \u201cevening instruction.\u201d  Id. \nat 56a-57a.  The panel also sharply criticized the \nDistrict, \nemphasizing \nthat \nits \ndecisions \nhad \n\n12 \n \n \n\u201c[n]ever been grounded in [Ava]\u2019s individual needs.\u201d  \nId. at 57a.  \nDespite ruling for Ava on her IDEA claim, the \nEighth Circuit regretfully rejected her ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Like the district court, the \npanel considered itself duty-bound under Monahan to \nrequire Ava to establish \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d by the District.  Id. at 3a-4a (quoting \nMonahan, 687 F.2d at 1171).  The panel recognized \nthat Ava \u201cmay have established a genuine dispute \nabout whether the district was negligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent.\u201d  Id. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under \nMonahan,\u201d the panel explained, \u201cthat\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  Id.  Because her case involved \u201c\u2018educational \nservices for disabled children,\u2019\u201d Ava had to \u201cprove that \nschool officials acted with \u2018either bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (citations omitted).  The panel \nheld that Ava \u201cha[d] failed to identify conduct clearing \nMonahan\u2019s bar\u201d\u2014and thus could not obtain any relief \nas a matter of law.  Id. at 4a-5a.   \nNotably, the panel expressed deep discomfort with \nMonahan\u2019s holding imposing \u201csuch a high bar for \nclaims based on educational services\u201d brought by \nchildren with disabilities.  Id. at 5a n.2.  The panel \nobserved that \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other \ndisability-discrimination contexts.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the \npanel explained that in every other scenario, \u201cno \nintent [is] required\u201d to obtain injunctive relief on a \n\u201cfailure-to-accommodate claim,\u201d while \u201cdamages\u201d \nclaims require only \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  Id.   \nMonahan\u2019s carve-out for school-age children with \ndisabilities, the panel continued, is \u201cwithout any \nanchor in statutory text.\u201d  Id.  The court noted that \nMonahan had \u201cspeculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \n\n13 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act]\u2019s protections\u201d (and thus the \nADA\u2019s).  Id.  But the panel pointed out that \u201cCongress \nrejected [that] premise\u201d in amendments to the EHA \nenacted \u201cjust a few years later.\u201d  Id.  The panel \nconcluded that Monahan has thus rightly \u201cbeen \nquestioned\u201d\u2014and stands as \u201ca lesson in why\u201d courts \nshould not \u201c\u2018add provisions\u2019\u201d to \u201c\u2018federal statute[s]\u2019\u201d \nthat aren\u2019t there.  Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, \n352 (2010)).  Nevertheless, the panel observed, \nMonahan \u201cremains the law of [this] circuit,\u201d at least \n\u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Id. \n5.  On June 5, 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied \nAva\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc.  Id. at 44a-45a.  \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented, noting that \nthey would grant the petition.  Id. at 44a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThis petition readily satisfies all the traditional \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a).  By \nadhering to circuit precedent imposing a uniquely \nstringent standard on children with disabilities \nbringing education-related claims, the Eighth Circuit \nfurther solidified a deep and entrenched circuit \nconflict.  Five circuits single out such children for \ndisfavored \ntreatment \nunder \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act, while two circuits adjudicate \ntheir claims under the same standards that apply to \neveryone else.  Even the District acknowledged the \ncircuit split below.  \nCertiorari is also warranted because the Eighth \nCircuit has incorrectly resolved an important \nquestion of federal law.  This Court has firmly \nrejected the \u201cdangerous principle that judges can give \nthe same statutory text different meanings in \n\n14 \n \n \ndifferent cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 \n(2005).  Yet five circuits do exactly that by \ninterpreting the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \ngenerally \napplicable \nprovisions \nto \nimpose \na \nheightened standard on children with disabilities and \nno one else.  This heightened standard lets school \ndistricts off the hook even when, as here, their \nbehavior evinces deliberate indifference to students\u2019 \nfederally protected rights.  This Court should reject \nthat asymmetric, atextual, and unduly harsh regime. \nThe question presented comes up frequently in \nlitigation brought by children with disabilities.  It \nshould now be resolved by this Court.  The circuit \nconflict has caused substantial harm to vulnerable \nchildren across the country by making it exceedingly \ndifficult to obtain much-needed relief under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.  Only this Court can resolve \nthe split, and this case provides an ideal vehicle to do \nso.  The petition should be granted. \nI. The Decision Below Solidifies A Deep And \nEntrenched 5-2 Circuit Split \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision confirms a 5-2 circuit \nsplit on whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nrequire \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nbringing \neducation-related claims to satisfy a more stringent \nstandard than other plaintiffs under those same \nstatutes.  The District has conceded the existence of a \n\u201ccircuit split on this issue.\u201d  CA8 Resp. to Reh\u2019g Pet. 2.  \nSeveral federal courts have acknowledged it as well.  \nSee, e.g., Hamilton Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 2005 WL \n3240597, at *10 (E.D. Wis. Nov. 29, 2005); O.F. ex rel. \nN.S. v. Chester Upland Sch. Dist., 246 F. Supp. 2d \n409, 420 (E.D. Pa. 2002).   \n\n15 \n \n \nA. Five Circuits Apply A Uniquely Stringent \nStandard To Children With Disabilities \nAlleging Discrimination By Their Schools \nOn one side of the split, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, and Eighth Circuits all hold that, unlike other \nADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs, children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims must \nprove \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain relief \nof any kind.  District courts within the D.C. Circuit \nconsistently follow the same rule. \nThe Eighth Circuit first invented this stringent, \ncontext-specific standard in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982).  There, the court \naffirmed the dismissal without prejudice of a \u201ccryptic\u201d \nRehabilitation Act claim alleging an \u201cimproper \neducational placement.\u201d  Id. at 1169-70.  To offer \u201ca \nfew words [of] guidance\u201d on remand, the court opined \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment should be \nshown\u201d before a Rehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be \nmade out\u201d in \u201cthe context of education of handicapped \nchildren.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71. \nMonahan \njustified \nimposing \na \nheightened \nstandard based on a perceived \u201cduty to harmonize the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d with the IDEA\u2019s predecessor\u2014the \nEHA\u2014given that the EHA specifically addressed the \neducational needs of children with disabilities.  Id. \nat 1171.  According to Monahan, the heightened \nstandard was necessary to \u201cgive each of these statutes \nthe full play intended by Congress\u201d and achieve \u201cwhat \n[the court] believe[d] to be a proper balance between \nthe \nrights \nof \nhandicapped \nchildren, \nthe \nresponsibilities of state education officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields.\u201d  Id.   \n\n16 \n \n \nEver since Monahan, the Eighth Circuit has \nadhered to this dicta and \u201cconsistently held\u201d that a \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard \napplies \nwhenever \u201calleged ADA and [Rehabilitation Act] \nviolations are based on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u201d regardless of the relief sought. \nB.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 \nF.3d 882, 887 (8th Cir. 2013); see, e.g., M.P. ex rel. K. \nv. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 982 \n(8th Cir. 2003).  And here, the Eighth Circuit rejected \nAva\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims because of \nMonahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard, recognizing \nthat it \u201cremains the law of [the] circuit.\u201d  App.5a n.2. \nThe Fourth Circuit has applied the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s approach for decades.  In Sellers ex rel. \nSellers v. School Board of the City of Manassas, 141 \nF.3d 524 (4th Cir. 1998), the Fourth Circuit explicitly \n\u201cagree[d] with\u201d Monahan \u201c\u2018that either bad faith or \ngross misjudgment should be shown\u2019\u201d for children \nwith disabilities to prevail on ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims related to their education.  Id. at 529 \n(quoting Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171).  The Fourth \nCircuit relied on that heightened standard to affirm \nthe dismissal of a lawsuit that, in the court\u2019s view, \nalleged only \u201cnegligence.\u201d  Id. \nThe Fifth Circuit has similarly fallen in lockstep \nwith the Eighth Circuit.  In D.A. ex rel. Latasha A. v. \nHouston Independent School District, 629 F.3d 450 \n(5th Cir. 2010), the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment must be shown in order to state \na cause of action\u201d under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct \u201cin th[e] educational context.\u201d  Id. at 454.  \nExpressly \u201cconcur[ring]\u201d with Monahan\u2019s reasoning, \nthe Fifth Circuit denied relief of any kind to a child \nwho, according to the court, could demonstrate \u201cno \n\n17 \n \n \nmore than negligence\u201d by school officials.  Id. at \n454-55; see, e.g., D.H.H. ex rel. Rob Anna H. v. \nKirbyville Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 2021 WL \n4948918, at *2 (5th Cir. Oct. 22, 2021) (applying \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard); C.C. v. \nHurst-Euless-Bedford Indep. Sch. Dist., 641 F. App\u2019x \n423, 426 (5th Cir. 2016) (same). \nThe Second and Sixth Circuits similarly \u201crequire[] \nproof of bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d for ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims \u201cin the context of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\u201d  C.L. v. Scarsdale Union \nFree Sch. Dist., 744 F.3d 826, 841 (2d Cir. 2014); \nsee, e.g., G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, \n635 (6th Cir. 2013); Li v. Revere Loc. Sch. Dist., 2023 \nWL 3302062, at *12-13 (6th Cir. May 8, 2023).  And \nwhile \u201cthe D.C. Circuit has never squarely adopted\u201d \nMonahan\u2019s heightened standard, district courts in \nthat circuit consistently require \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d \nin \nthis \nsingle \nfactual \ncontext.  \nReid-Witt ex rel. C.W. v. District of Columbia, 486 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2020) (collecting cases). \nB. Two Circuits Apply The Same Standards \nTo All Plaintiffs \nOn the other side of the split, the Third and Ninth \nCircuits treat children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims just like everyone else.  \nThose two circuits apply the same established \nstandards\u2014i.e., no intent required for injunctive \nrelief, and only deliberate indifference required for \ndamages\u2014to anyone suing under the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct, \nincluding \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities.  In addition, the Seventh Circuit has \nrecognized that no intent is required for children with \ndisabilities to obtain education-related injunctive \n\n18 \n \n \nrelief.  And district courts within the Tenth Circuit \nuniformly \napply \nthe \nbaseline \nstandards, \nnot \nMonahan\u2019s special rule disfavoring schoolchildren.   \nBelow, the District rightly conceded that the Third \nCircuit does not apply a Monahan-like \u201c\u2018bad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u2019 standard\u201d in the context of \n\u201cdiscrimination claims involving special education \nservices.\u201d  CA8 Resp. to Reh\u2019g Pet. 14.  For example, \nin D.E. v. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d \n260, 265 (3d Cir. 2014), the Third Circuit confronted \na lawsuit brought by a child with serious \u201cbehavior \nand social issues\u201d who had been \u201cmistakenly \nidentified as having mental retardation,\u201d rather than \nseeing his \u201cemotional and behavioral needs\u201d properly \naddressed.  Id. at 265-66.  Even though the case was \nbrought by a child with disabilities and asserted \neducation-related claims under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, the Third Circuit applied the \nsame standards for (1) \u201cma[king] out the prima facie \ncase\u201d of a statutory violation, and (2) obtaining \n\u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d  Id. at 269.  That is, the \nThird Circuit required \u201cintentional\u201d misconduct only \nfor damages, and held that a \u201cshowing of deliberate \nindifference satisfies that\u201d intent requirement.  Id.; \nsee, e.g., S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. \nDist., 729 F.3d 248, 262, 264 (3d Cir. 2013) (applying \nthe \nsame \nbaseline \nstandards \nto \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by a child with \ndisabilities); Sch. Dist. of Phila. v. Kirsch, 722 \nF. App\u2019x 215, 228-29 (3d Cir. 2018) (same). \nThe Ninth Circuit likewise applies the baseline \nstandards for children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims, just as it does in other ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act cases.  In Mark H. v. \nHamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth \n\n19 \n \n \nCircuit reversed a grant of summary judgment in \nfavor of the Hawaii Department of Education, \nconcluding that the Department was \u201con notice\u201d that \ntwo autistic children needed \u201cautism-specific services, \nbut did not provide those services,\u201d even though they \n\u201cwere available as a reasonable accommodation.\u201d  Id. \nat 1097.  The court held that the Department\u2019s failure \nto provide a reasonable accommodation was sufficient \nto show a statutory violation, while \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d exposed it to \u201cliab[ility] for damages.\u201d  \nId.; see, e.g., A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1206-07 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(applying the same baseline standards to ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by a child with \ndisabilities); R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington \nSch. Dist., 843 F. App\u2019x 80, 83 (9th Cir. 2021) (same). \nThe Seventh Circuit has explicitly recognized that \neducation-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims \nbrought by children with disabilities do \u201cnot require a \nshowing of intentional discrimination,\u201d so long as \nthey seek only declaratory or injunctive relief.  CTL \nex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d 524, \n528 n.4 (7th Cir. 2014).  In that respect, the Seventh \nCircuit fully aligns with the Third and Ninth Circuits.  \nAnd while the Seventh Circuit has not yet \u201cdecide[d] \nthe appropriate [intent] standard for damages,\u201d id., a \ndistrict court within the Seventh Circuit has explicitly \n\u201cdecline[d] to apply a bad faith or gross misjudgment \nstandard,\u201d because the Seventh Circuit has never \n\u201cadopted this requirement,\u201d Brown v. Dist. 299\u2013\nChicago Pub. Schs., 762 F. Supp. 2d 1076, 1084 n.8 \n(N.D. Ill. 2010).   \n \nAlthough the Tenth Circuit has not weighed in on \nthe question presented, district courts within that \ncircuit uniformly reject the Monahan approach and \n\n20 \n \n \ntreat education-related claims brought by children \nwith disabilities like ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by anybody else.  See, e.g., Clasen v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 266, 2019 WL 4034476, at *8 \n(D. Kan. Aug. 27, 2019).  Several decisions have \nexplicitly refused to apply the bad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard because \u201cthe Tenth Circuit \nhas not adopted that view.\u201d  Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, \n2008); see also Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nNo. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1145-47 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(similar).  Indeed, the Tenth Circuit consistently \napplies the same baseline standards in ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases, regardless of factual \ncontext.  See, e.g., Hampton v. Utah Dep\u2019t of Corr., 87 \nF.4th 1183, 1191 (10th Cir. 2023) (no intent for \ninjunction); Powers v. MJB Acquisition Corp., 184 \nF.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999) (deliberate \nindifference for damages).3 \nC. This Court Should Resolve The Split \nThe circuit split described above is clear and \nundeniable.  If Ava had brought her ADA and \n \n3   District courts within the First and Eleventh Circuits \nare divided amongst themselves over the proper standard.  \nFaced with education-related claims brought by children with \ndisabilities, some district courts apply the baseline standards \nthat govern ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims of all stripes.  \nSee, e.g., Ms. K v. City of South Portland, 407 F. Supp. 2d 290, \n295 (D. Me. 2006); T.H. ex rel. T.B. v. DeKalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., \n564 F. Supp. 3d 1349, 1360 (N.D. Ga. 2021).  Others, however, \nadhere to Monahan\u2019s context-specific rule.  See, e.g., S.W. v. \nHolbrook Pub. Sch., 221 F. Supp. 2d 222, 228 (D. Mass. 2002); \nE.W. v. Sch. Bd. of Miami-Dade Cnty. Fla., 307 F. Supp. 2d 1363, \n1370-71 (S.D. Fla. 2004).  This confusion and disarray only \nreinforce the need for this Court\u2019s review. \n\n21 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act claims in the Third or Ninth \nCircuits, she would have been subject to the same \nbaseline standards as any other plaintiff suing under \nthose statutes.  So too, in all likelihood, if she had \nsued in the Seventh or Tenth Circuits.  But because \nAva had the misfortune of attending school in the \nEighth Circuit, she was subject to a far more stringent \nstandard.  She would have faced the same impossibly \nlong odds if her case had arisen in the Second, Fourth, \nFifth, or Sixth Circuits (and likely the D.C. Circuit, at \nleast at the district court level).  \nThis deep divide in the lower courts will not fix \nitself.  Just last year, a unanimous panel of the Sixth \nCircuit sharply criticized its circuit precedent \nadopting Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard.  See Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, \n1002 (6th Cir. 2023).  The Sixth Circuit panel called \nMonahan\u2019s test \u201can impossibly high bar\u201d that is \u201chard \nto square\u201d with \u201cstatutory protection[s] that,\u201d by their \nterms, \u201creach[] even the unintentional denial of \nservices.\u201d  Id.  Nevertheless, the full Sixth Circuit did \nnot take the case en banc.   \nIn this case, a unanimous panel of the Eighth \nCircuit leveled similar criticisms.  App.5a n.2.  The \npanel attacked Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the \nRehabilitation Act\u2014and by extension, the ADA\u2014as \nlacking \u201cany anchor in statutory text,\u201d resting on a \n\u201cpremise\u201d that Congress later \u201crejected,\u201d and having \nrightly \n\u201cbeen \nquestioned\u201d \nby \ncourts \nand \ncommentators alike.  Id.  Yet the Eighth Circuit \ndenied Ava\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, over three \ndissents.  Id. at 44a-45a.  \nFederal statutory protections should not vary by \ngeography.  This Court should grant review to resolve \nthe entrenched circuit split on the question presented. \n\n22 \n \n \nII. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s Atextual Rule Is Wrong \nCertiorari is also warranted because, as the \ndecision below recognized, the rule invented by the \nEighth Circuit in Monahan is wrong.  Imposing a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related discrimination \nclaims\u2014and on nobody else\u2014cannot be squared with \nstatutory text, structure, or purpose.   \n1. The text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nlends no support for Monahan\u2019s rule.  Monahan \naddressed Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nwhich provides in relevant part:  \u201cNo otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability\u201d shall \u201csolely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  The Rehabilitation Act also \nexpressly incorporates \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, \nand rights set forth in [T]itle VI of the Civil Rights \nAct.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2).  The ADA establishes a \nmaterially identical prohibition for public entities and \nincorporates the same set of rights and remedies.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133; supra at 5-7. \nNeither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act \nexpressly sets forth an intent requirement for \nobtaining injunctive relief or compensatory damages.  \nBut as to damages, virtually all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014have recognized that plaintiffs \noutside the educational setting must prove intent, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s case interpreting \nTitle VI.  Supra at 6 & n.1 (collecting cases); see also \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001) \n(intent required for damages under Title VI).  The \n\n23 \n \n \noverwhelming majority have held that plaintiffs may \nsatisfy this intent requirement for damages by \nproving \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nwas \ndeliberately \nindifferent to their federally protected rights.  Supra \nat 7 & n.2 (collecting cases); see also Gebser v. Lago \nVista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998) \n(holding that deliberate indifference is sufficient to \nshow such intent under Title IX, which was likewise \n\u201cmodeled after Title VI\u201d); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. \n181, 185-89 (2002) (looking to Title IX precedent in \ndetermining the scope of private damages remedies \navailable under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and \nTitle VI).  \nMonahan was wrong to carve out from these \nbaseline standards an exception that applies solely to \neducation-related claims brought by children with \ndisabilities.  The substantive prohibitions set forth in \nSection 202 of the ADA and Section 504 of  \nthe Rehabilitation Act create a single standard \ngoverning all claims for review under each statute.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) \n(Rehabilitation Act).  Nothing in either provision \nremotely suggests that education-related claims \nbrought by children with disabilities should be \nanalyzed differently from all other claims seeking \nrelief under the same operative provision.  Rather, the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s prohibitions apply no \nmatter a plaintiff\u2019s age, the nature of her disability, \nor the factual context in which she suffered \ndiscrimination.   \nThe same goes for the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct\u2019s remedial provisions.  Section 203 of the ADA \nincorporates \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in [the Rehabilitation Act].\u201d  42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  And Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act \n\n24 \n \n \nprovides that \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in [T]itle VI\u201d are \u201cavailable to any person \naggrieved\u201d in violation of Section 504.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).  \u201cAny person\u201d means just that\u2014any \nperson.  This language requires equal treatment of all \nADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  It forecloses \nMonahan\u2019s \nview \nthat \neducation-related \nclaims \nbrought by children with disabilities must satisfy \nmore stringent standards than those governing all \nother claims.   \nAs for Title VI, that statute establishes an \nevenhanded remedy for any person subjected to \ndiscrimination in federally-funded programs or \nactivities \u201con the ground of race, color, or national \norigin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  That across-the-board \nprohibition offers no basis for imposing a uniquely \nstringent standard on any class of plaintiffs, let alone \nschool-age children.  Indeed, no Title VI case has ever \nadopted a Monahan-like \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d rule in the school setting.  It follows \nthat the normal standards that govern all other ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act cases\u2014i.e., no intent for \ninjunctive relief, and only deliberate indifference for \ndamages\u2014must govern in this one too. \nMonahan perceived a need to establish a bespoke \nstandard \u201cin the context of education of handicapped \nchildren,\u201d given the existence of another statute \nprotecting their interests (the EHA, now the IDEA), \nand the fact that \u201c[e]xperts often disagree on what the \nspecial needs of a handicapped child are.\u201d  687 F.2d \nat 1170-71.  But the unstated premise of that \nreasoning rests on the \u201cdangerous\u201d\u2014and firmly \nrejected\u2014\u201cprinciple that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Federal \n\n25 \n \n \ncourts have an \u201cobligation to maintain the consistent \nmeaning of words in statutory text.\u201d  United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 523 (2008).  They may not do \nwhat Monahan did:  Give \u201cthe same word[s], in the \nsame statutory provision, different meanings in \ndifferent factual contexts.\u201d  Id. at 522 (emphasis \nomitted). \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act are not \n\u201cchameleon[s].\u201d  Id. (quoting Clark, 543 U.S at 382).  \nTheir meaning \u201ccannot change\u201d whenever a child with \ndisabilities alleges discrimination at the hands of \nschool officials.  Id.  By reading the same operative \nlanguage to establish a different standard in this \nsingle context, Monahan engaged in nothing less than \n\u201cinterpretive contortion.\u201d  Id. \n2. Monahan justified its atextual rule primarily \nbased on \u201cspeculat[ion] that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s predecessor\u201d statute\u2014the EHA\u2014\u201cto limit \n[the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s] protections.\u201d  App.5a n.2.  \nMonahan perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the two \nstatutes and prevent the Rehabilitation Act from \nbecoming a cause of action \u201cfor educational \nmalpractice\u201d that would supplant the EHA.  687 F.2d \nat 1170-71.  According to Monahan, this step was \nneeded to \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \nintended by Congress.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  \nSoon after the Eighth Circuit decided Monahan, \nthis Court took Monahan\u2019s logic one step further.  In \nSmith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Court \nheld that the EHA provided the \u201cexclusive avenue\u201d for \nchildren with disabilities to bring discrimination \nclaims related to their education.  Id. at 1009 \n(emphasis added).   \n\n26 \n \n \nCrucially, though, Congress swiftly repudiated \nSmith\u2014and with it, Monahan\u2019s reasoning.  In 1985, \nCongress amended the EHA (now the IDEA) to \n\u201c\u2018reaffirm[] the viability\u2019 of federal statutes like the \nADA [and Rehabilitation Act] \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 \nno less integral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the \nrights of handicapped children.\u2019\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon \nCmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 161 (2017) (quoting H.R. \nRep. No. 99-296, at 4, 6 (1985)).  Now codified at \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), this IDEA amendment provides, \nin relevant part, that \u201c[n]othing in the [IDEA] shall \nbe construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, \nand remedies available under the Constitution, the \n[ADA], [Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal laws \nprotecting the rights of children with disabilities.\u201d  \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).   \n \nCongress thus expressly declared that the IDEA \ndoes not \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the ability of children with \ndisabilities to obtain relief under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act.  Id.  Yet Monahan asserted that \nthe IDEA (formerly the EHA) requires interpreting \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act to require children \nwith disabilities to show bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment \nto \nprevail \non \neducation-related \ndiscrimination claims.  687 F.2d at 1171.  That is, \nMonahan interpreted the IDEA to \u201crestrict\u201d and \n\u201climit\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d available to \nchildren like Ava under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  That is precisely what \nSection 1415(l) forbids.  So as the panel here \nrecognized, Congress \u201crejected Monahan\u2019s premise \njust a few years later.\u201d  See App.5a n.2. \n3. Monahan\u2019s rule singling out education-related \nclaims brought by children with disabilities is also \n\n27 \n \n \nfundamentally at odds with the purpose of the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.   \nCongress perceived \u201c[d]iscrimination against the \nhandicapped\u201d to be \u201cmost often the product, not of \ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295-96 (1985).  The baseline standards \nfor ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims respect that \nprinciple.  But Monahan\u2019s directive that children with \ndisabilities \nmust \nshow \nbad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment\u2014rather than the mere \u201cindifference,\u201d \n\u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d or \u201cbenign neglect\u201d required from \nother plaintiffs\u2014defies it.  Id.  By giving a free pass \nto actions driven by educational officials\u2019 \u201capathetic \nattitudes,\u201d Monahan immunized \u201cmuch of the conduct \nthat Congress sought to alter in passing the \nRehabilitation Act,\u201d as well as the ADA.  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 296-97.  And in so doing, Monahan imposed \nan artificial barrier to relief that is \u201cdifficult if not \nimpossible\u201d for children with disabilities to surmount.  \nId.; see also Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002. \nAll of this is anathema to the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s purpose of protecting people with \ndisabilities from passive mistreatment or neglect.  \nThere is simply no reason to think that Congress \nwanted to single out perhaps the most vulnerable \nsubset of such people\u2014school-age children\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment under laws enacted to combat \ndisability discrimination.  \nOf course, Monahan claimed to be implementing, \nrather than directly undermining, Congress\u2019s goals.  \nIt insisted that imposing a uniquely stringent \nstandard in this single context would strike \u201ca proper \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, \nthe responsibilities of state educational officials, and \n\n28 \n \n \nthe competence of courts to make judgments in \ntechnical fields,\u201d as \u201cCongress [supposedly] intended.\u201d  \n687 F.2d at 1171.  But Congress later made its intent \nclear, in unequivocal statutory text:  \u201cNothing\u201d in the \nIDEA \u201crestrict[s]\u201d or \u201climit[s]\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \n\u201cremedies\u201d provided by the ADA or Rehabilitation \nAct.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); see supra at 25-26.   \nIn any event, Monahan\u2019s atextual appeal to policy \nmakes little sense, even on its own terms.  Monahan \ndoubted \n\u201cthe \ncompetence \nof \ncourts \nto \nmake \njudgments\u201d about decisions by \u201ceducational officials\u201d \nin this \u201ctechnical field[].\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  But the \nIDEA demands inquiry into the \u201cadequacy of a given\u201d \nchild\u2019s education\u2014and thus judicial examination of \nthe \u201cdecisions\u201d made by educational officials, with \nappropriate respect for the \u201cexpertise and the exercise \nof judgment by school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel. \nJoseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386, 404 (2017).  Such respectful examination of \nschools\u2019 decisionmaking is equally proper under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act.   \nMore fundamentally, just last Term this Court \nresoundingly rejected the notion, echoed in Monahan, \nthat some matters are simply too \u201ctechnical\u201d for \ncourts to review independently.  Loper Bright Enters. \nv. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2267 (2024).  Federal \ncourts are surely capable of showing due respect for \neducational officials\u2019 experience and expertise while \nadjudicating discrimination claims in the school \nsetting\u2014just as they do in any other context.  It is a \nmistake to distort statutory text out of a misplaced \nfear that courts cannot responsibly decide cases \nimplicating sensitive or technical matters.  \nMonahan\u2019s atextual rule also leads to extremely \nbizarre results.  It requires pre-K, elementary, \n\n29 \n \n \nmiddle, and high school students suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to prove bad faith or \ngross misjudgment.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-\nApple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 968, \n972-73 (8th Cir. 2017).  But college students bringing \nthe same claims do not have to clear that hurdle, even \nin \ncircuits \nthat \napply \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard.  See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. \nHealth Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); \nSwanson v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 \n(6th Cir. 2001); Mershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d \n1069, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2006).  There is no good reason \nwhy a graduation ceremony should drastically alter \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndemonstrating \ndisability \ndiscrimination in the educational context.  And \nnothing suggests that this nonsensical asymmetric \ntreatment was part of Congress\u2019s design.  \n4. In short, Monahan\u2019s \u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about \nCongress\u2019s intent was fundamentally misguided.  \nApp.5a n.2.  Small wonder, then, that Monahan has \nbeen sharply\u2014and widely\u2014criticized.  See, e.g., id.; \nKnox, 62 F.4th at 1002; Howell ex rel. Howell v. \nWaterford Pub. Schs., 731 F. Supp. 1314, 1318 \n(E.D. Mich. 1990); Mark C. Weber, Accidently on \nPurpose: Intent in Disability Discrimination Law, 56 \nB.C. L. Rev. 1417, 1456-60 (2015); Thomas Simmons, \nThe ADA Prima Facie Plaintiff: A Critical Overview of \nEighth Circuit Case Law, 47 Drake L. Rev. 761, \n822-23 & nn.370-71 (1999).   \nThis Court should now fix Monahan\u2019s error.  In \nrecent years, the Court has repeatedly enforced the \nplain text of federal civil rights statutes that protect \nmembers \nof \nsociety\u2014including \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities\u2014from discrimination.  See, e.g., Perez v. \nSturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 146-47 (2023); \n\n30 \n \n \nFry, 580 U.S. at 158; Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 399; \nMuldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024); \nGroff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468-70 (2023); Babb v. \nWilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 402 (2020); Mount Lemmon Fire \nDist. v. Guido, 586 U.S. 1, 6-8 (2018).  These decisions \nvindicate the promise of textualism as a method of \nstatutory interpretation that is \u201cneutral as a matter \nof politics and policy.\u201d  Brett M. Kavanaugh, Fixing \nStatutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2135 \n(2016). \nThis case calls for continuing that important work.  \nThe Court should grant review to enforce the plain \nmeaning of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nIII. The Question Presented Is Exceptionally \nImportant And Merits Review In This Case \nWhether children with disabilities must satisfy \nMonahan\u2019s \nuniquely \nstringent \nstandard \nwhen \nbringing education-related claims under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act is a critically important question of \nfederal law.  The issue \u201cholds consequences not just \nfor [Ava] but for a great many children with \ndisabilities and their parents.\u201d  Perez, 598 U.S. at 146.  \nThe question presented warrants this Court\u2019s review, \nand this case is an ideal vehicle for answering it. \n1. Far too many children with disabilities are \n\u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d while at school. \nChoate, 469 U.S. at 295-96.  When that happens, the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act provide crucial means of \n\u201cprotecting their interests,\u201d just as those statutes \nassist other plaintiffs facing disability discrimination \nin other contexts.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 159.  Yet under the \natextual standard pioneered by the Eighth Circuit, \nonly children with disabilities face an \u201cimpossibly \n\n31 \n \n \nhigh bar\u201d for obtaining much-needed relief under \nthese statutes.  Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002.   \nThat disparity matters.  It is hard enough for \nparents to muster the resources needed to fight for \ntheir child\u2019s federally protected rights and remediate \nlife-altering educational gaps in the meantime.  Yet \nfive circuits have erected an additional barrier to \nrelief, while blunting incentives for schools to fulfill \ntheir responsibilities in the first place. \nIn this case, Ava\u2019s parents spent years fighting for \nthe District to provide her the same reasonable \naccommodations that her prior school district in \nKentucky had provided without issue.  App.50a-51a.  \nBut over and over again, the District refused, offering \n\u201ca series of shifting explanations\u201d that had nothing to \ndo with Ava\u2019s \u201cindividual needs.\u201d  Id. at 50a, 57a.  The \ndecision below acknowledged this and other evidence \nshowing that the District had been \u201cnegligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in denying the reasonable \naccommodations she desperately needed.  Id. at 3a.  \nThat should have been sufficient for Ava to obtain \nrelief, including compensatory damages, under both \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Id. at 5a n.2; see \nsupra at 6-7.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan, that\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  App.3a.   \nAva\u2019s experience is all too common.  A Westlaw \nsearch reveals hundreds of district court decisions \napplying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases, with \nthe overwhelming majority denying relief.4  Whether \n \n4  See, e.g., S.F. v. Union Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 2024 WL \n1316229, at *3-4 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 27, 2024); Torres v. Stewart \nCnty. Sch. Sys., 2023 WL 6368186, at *5-6 (M.D. Tenn.

It is impossible to \noverstate the importance of the question presented to \nsome of the most vulnerable members of our society.   \n2. This case is a perfect vehicle for resolving these \nissues.  The outcome here turned entirely on the \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment test.

A.J.T. ex rel. A.T., 96 F.4th \n1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  But here, A.J.T. sued Osseo \nArea \nSchools \n(the \nDistrict) \nfor \ndisability \n\n2a \n \ndiscrimination.  The district court1 granted the \nDistrict\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we \naffirm. \nA.J.T. has epilepsy, and her seizures are so severe \nin the morning that she can\u2019t go to school until noon.  \nHer parents asked for evening instruction to give her \na school day closer in length to that of her peers, but \nDistrict officials denied their repeated requests.  So \nA.J.T. sued through her parents, alleging violations of \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  The district \ncourt granted the District\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment, concluding that the District could not be \nheld liable because it did not act with bad faith or \ngross misjudgment. \nWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary \njudgment de novo, affirming only if \u201cthere is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  \nB.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R\u2013II Sch. Dist., 732 \nF.3d 882, 886 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a)).  We view all facts in favor of A.J.T. and give \nher \u201cthe benefit of all reasonable inferences in the \nrecord.\u201d  Argenyi v. Creighton Univ., 703 F.3d 441, 446 \n(8th Cir. 2013). \nClaims under Section 504 and the ADA live and \ndie together, as \u201cthe enforcement, remedies, and \nrights are the same under both.\u201d  B.M., 732 F.3d at \n887 (citation omitted); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133.  Section 504 \nrequires federal grantees to give \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d \npeople with disabilities \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to their \n \n1  The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District \nJudge for the District of Minnesota. \n\n3a \n \nbenefits.  See Argenyi, 703 F.3d at 448 (quoting \nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S.Ct. 712, \n83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985)); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And Title \nII of the ADA requires public entities to provide \nmeaningful access to their services, programs, or \nactivities.  Segal v. Metro. Council, 29 F.4th 399, 404 \n(8th Cir. 2022); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  \u201cMeaningful \naccess\u201d often requires \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d  \nChoate, 469 U.S. at 301, 105 S.Ct. 712. \nThat said, when the alleged ADA and Section 504 \nviolations are \u201cbased on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u201d a school district\u2019s simple failure to \nprovide a reasonable accommodation is not enough to \ntrigger liability.  B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (citation \nomitted).  Rather, a plaintiff must prove that school \nofficials acted with \u201ceither bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment,\u201d Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164, \n1171 (8th Cir. 1982), which requires \u201c \u2018something \nmore\u2019 than mere non-compliance with the applicable \nfederal statutes,\u201d B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (citation \nomitted).  The district\u2019s \u201cstatutory non-compliance \nmust \ndeviate \nso \nsubstantially \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to \ndemonstrate that [it] acted with wrongful intent.\u201d  Id. \nA.J.T. may have established a genuine dispute \nabout whether the district was negligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent, but under Monahan, that\u2019s \njust not enough.  She points out that her parents \nrepeatedly notified the District that its refusal to \nprovide evening instruction violated Section 504 and \nthe ADA.  And she says that the District violated \naccepted professional standards by failing to follow its \nown policies and procedures requiring its staff to \nreport, investigate, and respond to complaints of \ndiscrimination.  As evidence, she notes that the \n\n4a \n \nDistrict\u2019s Director of Student Services, who oversees \nSection 504 compliance, testified that she was \nunaware of the parents\u2019 complaints and did not know \nthat the District\u2019s policies permit at-home schooling \nas an accommodation.  But the Director\u2019s non-\ncompliance does not amount to a deviation \u201cso \nsubstantial[]\u201d that it demonstrates \u201cwrongful intent.\u201d  \nId. \nTrue, \u201cnotice of a student\u2019s disability coupled with \ndelay in implementing accommodations can show bad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment\u201d \nunder \nsome \ncircumstances.  Id. at 888; see also M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 982 (8th Cir. \n2003) (finding genuine dispute as to bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where school district knew about \ndisability-based harassment of a student, ignored the \nmother\u2019s repeated calls, offered patently unworkable \nsolutions, and reneged on its offer to cover \ntransportation costs to a new school after the student \ntransferred).  But here, the District did not ignore \nA.J.T.\u2019s needs or delay its efforts to address them, \neven if the efforts were inadequate.  District officials \nmet \nwith \nA.J.T.\u2019s \nparents \nand \nupdated \nher \nindividualized education program (IEP) each year.  \nHer IEP included a variety of services, like intensive \none-on-one instruction and a 15-minute extension of \nher school day so that she could safely leave after the \nhalls cleared.  And the District even offered 16 three-\nhour sessions at home each summer.  Regardless of \nwhether these actions were enough to provide \nmeaningful access, they do not show wrongful intent. \nA.J.T. has failed to identify conduct clearing \nMonahan\u2019s bar, so we are constrained to hold that \n\n5a \n \nsummary judgment was proper.2  We affirm the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment. \n \n \n \n \n2  Why do we have such a high bar for claims based on \neducational services when we require much less in other \ndisability-discrimination contexts?  See, e.g., Withers v. Johnson, \n763 F.3d 998, 1003 (8th Cir. 2014) (no intent required for failure-\nto-accommodate claim); Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d \n384, 388\u201389 (8th Cir. 2011) (deliberate indifference required for \ndamages); accord S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 260\u201365 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  The \nanswer is a lesson in why \u201c[w]e do not . . . add provisions to . . . \nfederal statute[s].\u201d  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, \n352, 130 S.Ct. 2295, 176 L.Ed.2d 1070 (2010). \nIn Monahan, we speculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s predecessor to limit Section 504\u2019s protections, and \nwithout any anchor in statutory text, we added a judicial gloss \non Section 504 to achieve that end.  687 F.2d at 1170\u201371.  \nCongress rejected Monahan\u2019s premise just a few years later.  See \nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99\u2013\n372, 100 Stat. 796; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But nonetheless, its bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment rule spread like wildfire.  See I.Z.M. \nv. Rosemount\u2013Apple Valley\u2013Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 973 \nn.6 (8th Cir. 2017) (collecting cases). \nMonahan has been questioned.  See, e.g., Knox Cnty. v. M.Q., \n62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. 2023); Mark C. Weber, Accidentally \non Purpose:  Intent in Disability Discrimination Law, 56 B.C. L. \nRev. 1417, 1455\u201364 (2015); AP ex rel. Peterson v. Anoka\u2013\nHennepin Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 11, 538 F.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff AJT is a teenage girl with a severe form \nof epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (\u201cLGS\u201d).  \nAs a result of her disability, AJT has significantly \ndiminished intellectual capacities and has seizures \nthroughout the day.  Since moving to Defendant \n\n7a \n \nOsseo School District (\u201cthe District\u201d) in 2015 from \nKentucky when she was in fourth grade, AJT and the \nDistrict have agreed that she is unable to begin school \nuntil noon due to morning seizure activity. \nIn 2021, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held \na hearing (\u201cthe administrative hearing\u201d), found the \nDistrict had violated the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), and ordered the District to \nprovide \nAJT \nwith \neye \ngaze \ntechnology \nand \ncompensatory hours of education, among other \nthings.  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 20.)  On \nSeptember 13, 2022, the Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \nDecision.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., Civil File No. \n21-1453 (MJD/DTS), 2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (Sept. \n13, 2022) [hereinafter, \u201cOsseo Area Schools\u201d]. \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs assert three claims \nagainst the District:  (1) violations of the IDEA; \n(2) violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (\u201c\u00a7 504\u201d); and (3) violations of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cthe ADA\u201d). \n(Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-47.) \nCurrently before the Court is the District\u2019s Motion \nfor Summary Judgement.  (Doc. 31.)  The Court heard \noral argument via Zoom on October 12, 2022. \nAs discussed in detail below, the evidence in the \nrecord supports granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  Even assuming AJT was denied \nthe benefits of a program or activity of a public entity \nreceiving federal funds and/or discriminated against \nbased on her disability, the District did not act with \nbad faith or gross misjudgment when making \neducational decisions regarding AJT.  In addition, \neven if the District took all the actions Plaintiffs \nallege it took, there is no evidence it did so to retaliate \n\n8a \n \nagainst AJT\u2019s parents for their advocacy on behalf of \nAJT.  Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claims are foreclosed \nfor a number of reasons.  Thus, the District\u2019s Motion \nfor Summary Judgment is granted. \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe facts of the case are well-known to the Court \nand the Parties and detailed in the Court\u2019s Order in \nOsseo Area Schools.  The Court only includes facts \nhere that are relevant to discussion of the instant \nmotion.  The relevant facts relate to AJT\u2019s elementary \nand middle school schedules.  The Parties have \nbriefed another motion related to AJT\u2019s high school \nschedule.  See Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., No. CV 21-\n1453 (MJD/DTS), 2022 WL 17082826, at *1 (D. Minn. \nNov. 18, 2022) (Order Denying Def\u2019s Motion for an \nOrder to Show Cause Why Pl. Should Not be Found \nin Contempt) [hereinafter, Osseo Area Schs. II]. \nA. Scheduled \nSchool \nDay \nin \nKentucky \nVersus in Minnesota \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, while a \nstudent in Kentucky, AJT received instruction from \nthe public school from noon until 6:00 p.m. each day, \nmostly in-school but supplemented with hours of \ninstruction in her home, which resulted in the same \nnumber of instructional hours as her nondisabled \npeers.  (Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.)  AJT\u2019s school days \nalways began at noon. \nFor the most part, a typical school day for a \nstudent in the District is 6.50 hours.  That has been \nthe goal for AJT\u2019s parents, AT and GT, since they \nmoved to the District.  However, due to AJT\u2019s \nunavailability for instruction before noon, the District \nnever \nprovided \nAJT \n6.50 \nhours \nof \nin-school \ninstruction. \n\n9a \n \nAfter several negotiations including different \nproposed IEPs, AJT has been in school 4 hours and 15 \nminutes each day for most of her years in the District \nreceiving intensive special education services.  She \nalways has one or two adults working solely with her \nproviding services and working on her learning goals.  \n(Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 9.) \nB. Negotiations Between AJT\u2019s Parents and \nthe District \nPlaintiffs assert that before the family moved from \nKentucky to Minnesota, they received assurances \nfrom the District that it would adopt AJT\u2019s Kentucky \nIEP \u201cin its entirety.\u201d  (AT Aff. \u00b6 12.) \nWhen AJT entered the District in October 2015, \nthe IEP team, including AJT\u2019s parents, agreed that \nstarting the school day at noon was appropriate given \nAJT\u2019s individual needs.  (Def. Ex. 16 (Oct. 16, 2015 \nPrior Written Notice (\u201cPWN\u201d)) at 2 (stating that AJT \n\u201ccan not [sic] come to school in the morning due to her \nseizure activity through the night and in the \nmorning\u201d).) \nWhen AJT\u2019s IEP team first met in 2015, the \nDistrict proposed an IEP that \u201cgenerally accepted the \ngoals and objectives on AJT\u2019s most recent IEP from \nKentucky.\u201d  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at \n*4.  AJT\u2019s parents requested two more IEP meetings, \nwhich were held on October 14 and 20, 2015.  At the \nOctober 14 meeting, AT asked if the school would \nprovide support in the evening and was told that the \nschool did \u201cnot provide both homebound and school \nsupport (modified).\u201d  (Pl. Ex. D at 2.)  The District\u2019s \nnotes from the October 14, 2015 IEP team meeting \nstate that AT said that he felt the District\u2019s failure to \nprovide educational support in the evening \u201cmight \n\n10a \n \nconflict with the ADA.  He wants statute.  His position \n[was] that [AJT] can handle a full day, it just can\u2019t \nstart until noon.\u201d  (Id.) \nFollowing those meetings, the District proposed an \nIEP that accepted the goals and objectives from AJT\u2019s \nKentucky IEP and included minutes of special \neducation service commensurate with those in the \nKentucky IEP.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *4.  The Kentucky IEP called for 125 minutes of \nspecial education in school daily and 90 minutes of in-\nhome special education daily, for a total of 215 \nminutes of special education instruction per day.  \n(Def. Ex. 9 at 8.)  The District\u2019s IEP included 240 \nminutes of direct special education daily and 20 \nminutes of direct speech services weekly.  (Def. Ex. \n11.) \nDuring AJT\u2019s years in the District, the Parties had \nseveral IEP meetings and the District issued more \nPWNs.  At one point, AJT\u2019s parents complained \u201cthe \nDistrict has not scheduled sufficient IEP team \nmeetings to discuss appropriate accommodations . . . \nand/or engage[d] in the interactive process\u201d to meet \nAJT\u2019s needs.  (Def. Ex. 10 at 1.)  After negotiation, the \nParties agreed that AJT\u2019s school day would be from \nnoon to 4:15 p.m., which was extended after the usual \nelementary school day ended at 4:00 p.m.  The IEP \ncontaining this schedule was the last-agreed upon \nIEP between the Parties\u2014the \u201cstay-put\u201d IEP that \nremained in place during the pendency of disputes \nbetween the Parties.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *5.  Thus, AJT\u2019s school days have been \n4.25 hours rather than the 6.50 hours her parents \nrequested. \nBeginning in February 2018, in preparation for \nAJT\u2019s transition from elementary school to middle \n\n11a \n \nschool, AJT\u2019s parents met with Former District \nSpecial Education Site Coordinator Joy Fredrickson \nto discuss AJT\u2019s middle school day.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 27.)  A \ntypical middle school day ends at 2:40 p.m. and AJT\u2019s \nparents were \u201cdistraught\u201d to learn that AJT would \nhave shorter school days in middle school.  (Id.)  On \nMarch 16, AJT\u2019s parents again met with Fredrickson \nand provided six options for 4.25-hour middle school \ndays for AJT.  (Id. \u00b6 28.)  On April 3, the District sent \nAT and GT a PWN proposing a noon to 3:00 p.m. \nschool day.  (Id. \u00b6 29.)  At an April 5, 2018 IEP \nmeeting, AJT\u2019s parents found it \u201cincredible\u201d that the \nDistrict \u201cmade the decision to reduce hours before \n[they] had an IEP Team meeting to discuss program \ngoals and objectives for the next year, [AJT\u2019s] needs \nor whether she needed a shortened day.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 30.)  \nIn the end, AJT\u2019s middle school day schedule \ncontinued to be from 12:00 to 4:15 p.m. under the \nstay-put IEP.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *5. \nOn April 23, 2018, AT sent an email to the District \nstating that he felt the District\u2019s acts were \ndiscriminatory and retaliatory based, in part, on \nAJT\u2019s \u201cdisability . . . and or parental protected \nactivity\u201d of advocating for AJT during the IEP \nprocess.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 31.)  AT attested that \u201cjust as in \nyears prior,\u201d the District did not investigate or resolve \nhis complaints and did not provide him with its \nnondiscrimination policy or complaint procedures.  \n(Id. \u00b6 32.)  He avers that this is when the District \nbegan treating him differently.  (Id. \u00b6 33.)  On April \n30, 2018, AT sent an email to Fredrickson stating, \ninter alia, that he had filed complaints with the \nMinnesota Department of Education (\u201cMDE\u201d), the \nU.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, \n\n12a \n \nand the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights \nDivision.  (Id. \u00b6 35; Def. Ex. 23.)  This dispute was \napparently resolved by \u201cthe Parties agreeing to an \nIndependent Education Evaluation (IEE) of [AJT by \nDr. Reichle], and a later triennial evaluation, and \nusing these materials to guide later educational \nplanning.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 3-4.) \nThroughout the process, the District has refused \nto provide evening instruction because, variously, the \nDistrict does not provide \u201cboth homebound and school \nsupport\u201d (Pl. Ex. D (Dist. Oct. 14, 2015 IEP meeting \nnotes) at 2); state law does not mandate it (Def. Ex. \n16 (Oct. 16, 2015 PWN) at 2); and/or the District was \nworried about the precedent it would start not only in \nthe District, but for area school districts (Def. Ex. 18 \n(June 6, 2016 PWN) at 1). \nEach year, AJT\u2019s parents provide the District with \na letter from AJT\u2019s treating neurologist requesting \nthat she be \u201cexempted from school attendance before \nnoon in order to manage her seizure activity.\u201d  Osseo \nArea Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at *5 (cleaned up).  The \nDistrict offers to serve AJT whenever she is available \nduring the regular school day, including before 12:00 \np.m.  (See, e.g., Def. Ex. 22 (April 2, 2018 PWN) at 2.) \nC. Dr. Joe Reichle\u2019s IEE and Trial Tests \nIn 2019, at the Parties\u2019 request, Dr. Joe Reichle \nconducted an independent educational evaluation \n(\u201cIEE\u201d) of AJT.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *7.  Among Dr. Reichle\u2019s recommendations was as \nmuch instruction time as possible \u201cduring [AJT\u2019s] \nalert \nhours,\u201d \nwhich \noptimally \nare \n\u201cbetween \napproximately noon and 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id. (brackets in \noriginal). \n\n13a \n \nIn autumn 2020, AJT\u2019s parents hired Dr. Reichle \nto conduct a series of discrete trial tests \u201cto assess how \ninterventions in the mid and late afternoons might \nimpact [AJT\u2019s] learning.\u201d  Id. (brackets in original). \nDr. Reichel performed trials of late afternoon \ninstruction from 4:15 to 5:30 p.m. in AJT\u2019s home, \nwhich he compared to instruction conducted in AJT\u2019s \nhome from noon to 1:15 p.m.  Id.  During the trials, \nAJT made gains on skills she was learning in school. \nId. \nD. Statements Made by Special Education \nDirector Katheryn (\u201cKate\u201d) M. Emmons \nAJT\u2019s parents have participated in many meetings \nwith her IEP team and District officials, including the \nDistrict\u2019s highest special education administrator, \nSpecial Education Director Kate Emmons, to ask that \nAJT receive a full day of school beginning at noon. \n(Amend. Compl. \u00b6 59; AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 17-32.) \nIn her role, Emmons develops and promotes \nsuitable procedures for \u201cidentification, evaluation, \nand instructional programming of children eligible for \nSpecial Education . . . services\u201d and evaluates \u201cthe \nschool system\u2019s approaches and students\u2019 responses to \nspecialized programs for children not achieving in \nspecial . . . education programs,\u201d among other duties.  \n(Pl. Ex. G at 3 (Emmons\u2019 Position Description).)1  She \nis also \u201cresponsible for program development, \ncoordination, and evaluation; in-service training; and \ngeneral \nspecial \neducation \nsupervision \nand \nadministration.\u201d  (Id. at 15 (District Total Special \n \n1  Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G contains many documents and is \ndivided into several parts (G1, G2, G3, etc.) in the Court\u2019s \nCMECF filing system. \n\n14a \n \nEducation System).)  Emmons is not only responsible \nfor the District\u2019s special education programs but also \noversees implementation and enforcement of Section \n504, which prohibits a federally-funded program from \ndiscriminating against a disabled individual solely by \nreason of that person\u2019s disability.  (Def. Ex. 1 \n(Emmons Dep.) at 41-42)2; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).)  She \nsupervises Coordinators who, among other things, \nensure compliance with policies, procedures, and \nrules.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 15-26.) \nEmmons testified that District policy requires \ninvestigation \nof \nall \ncomplaints \nof \ndisability \ndiscrimination but that she was unaware of any \ninvestigation regarding AJT.  (Id. at 70-71.)  The \nDistrict\u2019s Nondiscrimination Policy 102 requires \ndiscrimination complaints be reported to the \u00a7 504 \nCoordinator, whom Emmons testified was Jill Lesn\u00e9.  \n(Id. at 48-49; Pl. Ex. G2 (Osseo Area Schools \nEmployee Handbook) at 50.) \nAlthough the Employee Handbook listed Emmons \nas the \u00a7 504 Coordinator in 2020-21, she testified she \nwas not and did not know why the Handbook stated \nshe was.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 49.)  Emmons \ntestified that she would report any discrimination she \nbecame aware of to Ms. Lesn\u00e9.  (Id. at 48-49.)  \nEmmons \nnoted \nthat \nit \nis \nevery \nemployee\u2019s \nresponsibility \nto \ncomply \nwith \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s \nnondiscrimination \npolicies \nand \neveryone\u2019s \nresponsibility to report noncompliance with \u00a7 504 \n \n2  Plaintiffs cited pages of Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G that did not \ncontain this information.  (See Doc. 38 at 11 n.20.)  It was obvious \nto the Court that this and other information cited to Plaintiffs\u2019 \nExhibit G came from Emmons\u2019 deposition, which is Defendants\u2019 \nExhibit 1.  The Court has corrected the citations. \n\n15a \n \nonce they are aware of it.  (Id. at 44-45, 56.)  On the \nother hand, she testified that IDEA disputes would be \nhandled via other avenues such as conciliation \nconferences and mediation.  (Id. at 48.) \nAt Emmons\u2019 deposition, Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel noted \nthat the District\u2019s Total Special Education System \n(\u201cTSES\u201d) says that \u201cstudents can have a combination \nof alternate methods of instruction, including \nhomebound and in-person instruction.\u201d  (Id. at 176-\n77.)  Emmons responded, \u201cNo, where is that?  We \nmight have to modify that.\u201d  (Id. at 177; see also Pl. \nEx. G at 23 (TSES) (\u201cProgram alternatives are \ncomprised of the type of services provided, the setting \nin which services occur. . . .  A pupil may receive \nspecial education services in more than one \nalternative based on the IEP.\u201d) (emphasis added).) \nWhen asked about a discrimination investigation \ninvolving AJT in her deposition, Emmons stated she \nknew nothing about it.  However, AT attests that he \nand GT met with her more than once to complain \nabout discriminatory treatment toward AJT.  (AT Aff. \n\u00b6 50.)  He states that Emmons\u2019 response was to tell \nthem to hire a personal care attendant (\u201cPCA\u201d) after \nschool hours instead of extending AJT\u2019s school day, \nwhich \u201creflect[ed] stereotyped misperceptions that \n[AJT] was not worthy of a full day of instruction.\u201d  \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs assert that other school employees also \ndisclaimed knowledge of AJT\u2019s parents\u2019 complaints \nregarding the number of hours of instruction she \nreceived every day.  (Doc. 38 at 11 (citing AT Aff; \nEmmons Dep.; Ex. G to Goetz Aff., all without \npinpoint citations).)  The only support for this \nstatement in AT\u2019s Affidavit is AT\u2019s assertion that he \nand GT met with Emmons.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 50.) \n\n16a \n \nE. Expert Reports \nAJT filed one expert report and updates thereto \nand the District filed three expert reports.  In relevant \npart, the reports provide the following opinions. \n1. Dr. Joe Reichle\u2019s Expert Reports \nDr. Joe Reichle, opined, in brief, \u201cthe lack of a full \nschool day has significantly contributed to limit \n[AJT\u2019s] learning opportunities\u201d and that there was a \nlack \nof \na \ncomprehensive \naugmentative \ncommunication plan resulting from a comprehensive \nassessment of AJT\u2019s needs both prior to his 2019 \nassessment and after the ALJ\u2019s 2021 Decision.  (Pl. \nEx. F at 3-4.)  He explained that when he designed his \nDecember 2019 communication trial, he considered \nmorning, early afternoon, and late afternoon sessions \nto compare \u201cperformance as a function of time of day,\u201d \nbut AJT\u2019s parents were unwilling to take this \n\u201csubstantial health risk\u201d based on their physicians\u2019 \nopinions \u201cregarding the potential danger of disrupting \nAJT\u2019s sleep pattern.\u201d   (Pl. Ex. F2 at 12.)  He noted \nthat \u201cDr. Breningstall and his predecessors are \nphysicians directed by medical knowledge and \nexperience.  Their recommendations and support of \nthe parents\u2019 position . . . led to [him conducting] only \nearly p.m. and late p.m. . . . sessions.\u201d  (Id. at 13.) \n2. The District\u2019s Experts \na)  Dr. Wills\u2019 Expert Reports \nDr. Karen Wills is a neuropsychologist and is \nlicensed to practice clinical psychology in Minnesota.  \n(Def. Ex. 2 at 1.)  Dr. Wills stated that parents \nperceive their children \u201cthrough rose colored glasses\u201d \nand overestimate their competencies.  (Id. at 3.)  In \nrelevant part, Dr. Wills opined that AJT\u2019s rate of \nprogress was not demonstrably better in Kentucky \n\n17a \n \nthan in the District, that AJT has not regressed since \nenrolling in the District, and that most of AJT\u2019s fellow \nstudents\u2019 instructional days include non-instructional \ntime.  (Id. at 3-7, 11, 15). \nb)  Marcy Doud\u2019s Expert Report \nThe District did not provide Marcy Doud\u2019s \ncredentials.  (Def. Ex. 28.)  Doud opined that \u201cgiven \n[AJT\u2019s] disabilities and abilities and her medical \nneeds,\u201d the District chose a reasonable course of \neducation \nand \n1:1 \ninstruction \nwith \nlimited \ndistractions was the \u201csingle common denominator\u201d for \nAJT\u2019s optimal learning environment, regardless of \nthe time.  (Id. \u00b6 6.)  She also stated that AT was at the \nIEP meeting where the IEP with the 12:00 to 4:15 \nschool day was proposed, that AJT\u2019s parents received \nthe PWN stating that the IEP would be implemented \nunless they objected, and that they did not do so.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) \nc)  Howard C. Shane, Ph.D\u2019s Expert \nReport \nDr. \nShane \nis \nan \nassociate \nprofessor \nof \notolaryngology at Harvard Medical School.  (Def. Ex. \n29 at 1.)  Dr. Shane stated that the central question \nin this case is how AJT\u2019s school day is divided between \nhome and school.  (Id.)  He opined that without a \nsystematic review of AJT\u2019s seizure pattern across \nseveral different weekdays and weekend days over \ntime, it is impossible to make definitive conclusions \nabout the best times for AJT to learn.  (Id. at 2.)  He \nnotes that a table by school staff tracking AJT\u2019s \nseizures during school hours for a month in 2021 \nshowed AJT had multiple seizures in the afternoons \nat school, some so severe that she could not return to \ninstruction.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Since AJT has regular \n\n18a \n \nafternoon seizures at school, Dr. Shane states that \u201cit \ndoes not seem practical\u201d to base AJT\u2019s schedule \u201con \nparental \nreporting \n(or \npreference) \nof \nseizure \nfrequency and severity during the morning and \ncertainly not without a careful analysis of the \noccurrence and severity of seizure activity in the \n[morning].\u201d  (Id. at 4, 16.) \nOther facts will be discussed as necessary \nE. Desired Relief \nThe District has filed a motion for summary \njudgment.  Although Plaintiffs have not filed a similar \nmotion, they nonetheless assert they are entitled to \nsummary judgement.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs \nargue that issues of material fact exist that make \nsummary judgment for the District inappropriate. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment is appropriate if, viewing all \nfacts in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty, there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  The party \nseeking summary judgment bears the burden of \nshowing that there is no disputed issue of material \nfact.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  \u201cA dispute is genuine \nif the evidence is such that it could cause a reasonable \njury to return a verdict for either party; a fact is \nmaterial if its resolution affects the outcome of the \ncase.\u201d  Amini v. City of Minneapolis, 643 F.3d 1068, \n1074 (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \n\n19a \n \nB. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims \n1. Legal Standards \nTitle II of the ADA prohibits public entities \nfrom discriminating based on disability in \nservices, programs, or activities. Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability \n. . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  These \nstatutes provide[] the same rights, procedures, \nand remedies against discrimination. \nI.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., \n863 F.3d 966, 972 (8th Cir. 2017) (alterations in \noriginal) (internal citations omitted). Claims under \nthe ADA and Section 504 are analyzed using the same \nstandard.  See AP v. Anoka-Hennepin ISD No. 11, 538 \nF. Supp. 2d 1125, 1139 (D. Minn. 2008). \nA plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case . . . requires a \nshowing that the plaintiff (1) was a qualified \nindividual with a disability; (2) was denied the \nbenefits of a program or activity of a public \nentity receiving federal funds; and (3) was \ndiscriminated against based on [her] disability.  \nMore specifically, we have said that a claim \nunder \u00a7 504 in the context of education of \nhandicapped children requires parents to show \nthat the school district acted in bad faith or \nwith \ngross \nmisjudgment \nby \ndeparting \nsubstantially \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, \npractice \nor \nstandards \nas \nto \n\n20a \n \ndemonstrate that those responsible actually did \nnot base the decision on such a judgment. \nEst. of Barnwell v. Watson, 880 F.3d 998, 1004 (8th \nCir. 2018) (citations omitted). \nIn this case, there is no dispute that AJT is a \nqualified individual with a disability.  In addition, \nelements 2 and 3 are inextricably intertwined because \nPlaintiffs assert AJT was denied the same length \nschool day as her nondisabled peers based on her \ndisability.  However, even assuming AJT was denied \nthe benefits of a program or activity of a public entity \nreceiving federal funds and discriminated against \nbased on her disability, Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail \nbecause the District did not act with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment. \n2. Bad Faith or Gross Misjudgment \n\u201c[W]here alleged ADA and \u00a7 504 violations are \nbased on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in \nbad faith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. \nMiller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, \n887 (8th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted).  Something \nmore than a \u201cmere violation of the IDEA must be \nshown to demonstrate a violation of \u00a7 504.\u201d  Brantley \nex rel. Brantley v. ISD No. 625, 936 F. Supp. 649, 657 \n(D. Minn. 1996). \na) Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments \nPlaintiffs argue that intent should not be required \nin failure to accommodate claims for disability \ndiscrimination in elementary or secondary education \nbecause (1) intent is not a burden imposed by \u00a7 504 or \nthe ADA or their interpretive regulations and is not \nrequired in all circuits; (2) requiring intent is contrary \nto Supreme Court precedent stating that intent is not \n\n21a \n \na required element of disability discrimination claims \n(citing Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295, 309 \n(1985) (a case dealing with reduction in Medicaid \nbenefits); (3) Eighth Circuit precedent does not \nrequire intent in employment or post-secondary \neducation reasonable accommodation claims and \nthere is no reason to treat elementary and secondary \neducation claims differently; and (4) proof of intent is \nnot required in other jurisdictions (citing Ability Ctr. \nv. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 912 (6th Cir. 2004); \nHenrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 277-78 (2d \nCir. 2003); Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel. \nM.E., 172 F.3d 238, 253 (3d Cir. 1999); Washington v. \nInd. High Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 846 \n(7th Cir. 1999)). (Doc. 38 at 31-33.) \nWhile Plaintiffs admit that the Eighth Circuit \nrequires proof of intent in disability discrimination in \neducation cases based on failure to accommodate and \ndisparate treatment claims, they argue that in failure \nto accommodate claims, the standard is \u201csoftened,\u201d \nrequiring \u201conly notice of the need for a reasonable \naccommodation and school district inaction, delay, or \nineffective action.\u201d  (Id. (citing M.P. v. ISD No. 721, \n326 F.3d 975, 982-83 (8th Cir. 2003)). \nIn M.P., the court held that a jury could find that \na school district acted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment when it failed to answer a mother\u2019s \ndaily phone calls about bullying her son suffered due \nto a district employee making his schizophrenia \ndiagnosis public and never taking steps to protect the \nboy\u2019s safety and academic interests after knowing \nabout the bullying. 326 F.3d at 982-83.  Plaintiffs \nassert that M.P. is similar to this case because \nPlaintiffs also raised issues of \u201cfailure to provide \nreasonable accommodations at school, failure to \n\n22a \n \ninvestigate complaints of disability discrimination, \nand failure to take appropriate and effective remedial \nmeasures upon notice to school authorities.\u201d  (Doc. 38 \nat 37.)  Plaintiffs note that in M.P., the court held that \n\u201c[u]nder some circumstances, notice of a student\u2019s \ndisability coupled with delay in implementing \naccommodations can show bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  (Id. at 38.) \nPlaintiffs argue that under either a disparate \ntreatment theory or failure to accommodate approach, \nthe District discriminated against them with bad \nfaith, a gross departure from professional standards, \nand deliberate indifference.  (Id. at 37 (citing, inter \nalia, M.P., 326 F.3d at 982; Monahan v. State of Neb., \n687 F.2d 1164, 1171 (8th Cir. 1982).)  Plaintiffs assert \nthat \u201cignoring six years of disability discrimination \ncomplaints by A.T. and G.T. was not within the scope \nof professionally acceptable choices because the \nDistrict\u2019s own policies expressly prohibit that \nresponse.\u201d  (Id. at 34-35.)  Plaintiffs state that the \nDistrict fails to meet its initial burden to establish a \nlack of discriminatory intent. \nPlaintiffs also argue that the familiar McDonnell \nDouglas burden-shifting analysis used in employment \ndiscrimination cases is appropriate in this case and \nthat they have evidence sufficient to survive \nsummary judgment under this analysis.  (Id. at 39.) \nb) Analysis \nBefore \nreaching \nthe \nmerits \nof \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments, two threshold issues must be decided: \n(1) whether the employment cases cited by Plaintiffs \nare inapposite and (2) whether the \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard championed by Plaintiffs is \n\n23a \n \nproper for a challenge to a student\u2019s educational \nprogramming. \ni. Plaintiffs\u2019 Employment Cases are \nInapposite \nPlaintiffs cite several employment cases that only \nrequire plaintiffs to prove defendants failed to provide \na \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to survive summary \njudgment.  (Id. at 27, 32.)  It is inappropriate to rely \non these cases.  See Frequently Asked Questions \nAbout Section 504 and the Education of Children with \nDisabilities, 111 LRP 76408 (OCR 2011) at 11 \n(courtesy copy provided as attachment to Defendant\u2019s \nReply).  The Department of Education (\u201cthe DOE\u201d) \ncautions that the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d is \n\u201ca term used in the employment context\u201d that is \n\u201csometimes used incorrectly to refer to related aids \nand services in the elementary and secondary school \ncontext . . . .\u201d  Id.  Opinions from agencies are entitled \nto at least some deference. Doe v. Osseo Area Sch. \nDist., 296 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (D. Minn. 2017) \n(citing Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. \n504, \n512 \n(1994)) \n(holding \nthat \nan \nagency\u2019s \ninterpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \n\u201csubstantial deference\u201d); see also 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33 \n(schools are required to provide a free appropriate \npublic education (\u201cFAPE\u201d) to disabled students, not \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d).  Deference to the DOE \nis especially reasonable here where the McDonnell \nDouglas analysis from employment law could have \nbeen adopted into the education discrimination \ncontext and the courts declined to do so. \n\n24a \n \nii. The Correct Liability Standard is \n\u201cBad \nFaith \nor \nGross \nMisjudgment\u201d \nPlaintiffs assert they need only prove that \nPlaintiffs acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to \nestablish their prima facie case.  However, the Eighth \nCircuit \n. . . held in AP v. Anoka\u2013Hennepin Indep. \nSchool Dist. No. 11 that bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment is an element of a disability-\ndiscrimination claim only in the context of \nsubstantive challenges to a disabled child\u2019s \nindividualized education plan.  In cases not \ninvolving challenges to educational services, \na showing of deliberate indifference on the \ndefendant\u2019s \npart \nis \nnecessary\u2014and \nsufficient\u2014to recover the compensatory \ndamages under the ADA or \u00a7 504 . . . . \nHough v. Shakopee Pub. Schs., 608 F. Supp. 2d 1087, \n1115-16 (D. Minn. 2009) (holding that searches were \nnot part of a student\u2019s educational program and \ntherefore \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d was the correct \nstandard) (citations omitted); I.Z.M., 863 F.3d at 973 \n(\u201cWe have consistently held that where alleged ADA \nand \u00a7 504 violations are based on educational services \n. . ., the plaintiff must prove that school officials acted \nin bad faith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d) (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted); see also A.K.B. v. ISD 194, \nNo. 19-CV-2421 (SRN/KMM), 2020 WL 1470971, at \n*13 (D. Minn. Mar. 26, 2020) (applying deliberate \nindifference \nstandard \nin \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \naccommodation in school). \nThis case is based on Plaintiffs\u2019 dissatisfaction \nwith AJT\u2019s educational services.  Even the retaliation \n\n25a \n \nclaim, discussed below, is inextricably intertwined \nwith the provision of educational services.  M.P., cited \nby Plaintiffs is distinguishable because that case \ninvolved a school district\u2019s deliberate indifference to a \nmother\u2019s pleas for help for her bullied son.  326 F.3d \nat 982-83.  The Eighth Circuit found the \u201calleged \nfailure to protect M.P. from unlawful discrimination \non the basis of his disability is a claim . . . wholly \nunrelated to the IEP process.\u201d  M.P. v. ISD No. 721, \n439 F.3d 865, 868 (8th Cir. 2006) [M.P. II] (\u201cAlthough \nthe Eighth Circuit applied the bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment standard in M.P., the court only did so \nbecause the parties assumed that to be the standard \nand the court never discussed the deliberate \nindifference standard that has been applied to claims \nof student-on-student harassment since M.P. was \ndecided.\u201d). \niii. The District did not Act with Bad \nFaith or Gross Misjudgment \nIn order to establish bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment, a plaintiff must show that the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct departed substantially \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice \nor standards so as to demonstrate that the \npersons responsible actually did not base the \ndecision on such a judgment.  Because the ADA \nand \u00a7 504 do not create general tort liability for \neducational malpractice, bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment requires \u201csomething more\u201d than \nmere non-compliance with the applicable \nfederal statutes.  The defendant\u2019s statutory \nnon-compliance must deviate so substantially \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice, \nor standards as to demonstrate that the \ndefendant acted with wrongful intent. \n\n26a \n \nB.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (cleaned up) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs argue that when the District ignored six \nyears of disability discrimination complaints by AJT\u2019s \nparents, it violated the District\u2019s own policies and its \nactions \nwere \nnot \nwithin \nthe \nscope \nof \nany \nprofessionally-acceptable choices available to the \nDistrict.  As evidence, Plaintiffs state, without \ncitation, that \u201call\u201d District officials testified regarding \ntheir professional obligations to know and comply \nwith the law and to ensure that all discrimination \nclaims are investigated and resolved \u201cpursuant to \ntheir licenses, position descriptions, and District \npolicies.\u201d  (Doc. 38 at 4.)  They also aver that while the \nDistrict\u2019s \nSuperintendent, \nEmmons, \nand \n\u00a7 504 \nCoordinator all expressed ignorance of the Plaintiffs\u2019 \ndiscrimination complaints; lack of District response; \nand even any knowledge of the dispute, the following \nevidence undermines those claims: \n1) The professional licensing obligations of each \nofficial to know and comply with the IDEA, \n\u00a7 504, and the ADA; \n2)  The position descriptions of each official that \nrequires them to know and comply with the \nIDEA, \u00a7 504 and the ADA and to supervise and \nensure compliance by other staff, including \nCoordinators; \n3)  District \npolicies \nrequiring \ninvestigation, \nparental notice of rights, and correction of any \ndiscrimination complaint, formal or informal, \nwritten or verbal, by every District employee; \nand \n4)  The documentation of disability complaints \nand credible testimony of AT that he met with \nand communicated directly with various \n\n27a \n \nCoordinators, \nthe \nSuperintendent, \nand \nEmmons about complaints. \n(Id. at 6-7 (emphasis in original).)  Plaintiffs further \nassert, without support, \u201cThe testimony at [the \nadministrative] \nhearing \nestablished \nthat \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s [Special Education Site] Coordinator, Joy \nFredrickson, acted for years at the direction of a \nsource outside of the IEP Team as corroborated by all \nIEP Team members including AJT\u2019s teachers and \nParents.\u201d  (Id. at 5 (emphasis in original).) \nRegarding licensing, position descriptions, and \ndistrict policies, other than information related to \nEmmons, Plaintiffs only state, \nEach \nDistrict \nofficial \ndid \ntestify \nto \nestablished \nprofessional \nstandards, \nincluding licensing obligations and position \ndescriptions that require knowledge of the \nlaws that prohibit disability discrimination, \nand of their professional obligations to \nensure compliance with District policies that \nrequire reporting, investigation, notice to \nparents of rights, and correction of disability \ndiscrimination complaints, written or verbal, \nformal or informal. \n(Doc. 38 at 11-12 n.21 (emphasis in original) \n(\u201cDeposition of Kate Emmons, Ex. G to Goetz \nAffidavit; and Tharpe Affidavit.\u201d).)  The Court is \nunable to find support for these claims in the \nvoluminous documents Plaintiffs cite to support \nthem. See Gardner v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 218 \nF.R.D. 216, 218 n.2 (D. Minn. 2003) (\u201c[J]udges are not \nlike pigs, hunting for truffles buried in [exhibits] and \nneed not excavate masses of papers in search of \nrevealing tidbits . . . .\u201d) (cleaned up) (citations \n\n28a \n \nomitted).  The Employee Handbook, which is part of \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G, is not evidence of what District \nofficials testified to actually knowing. \nRegarding documentation of disability complaints, \nAT\u2019s affidavit states that during the October 14, 2015 \nIEP meeting, he told \u201cthe District\u201d that its decision to \ngive AJT less than a full day of school did not comply \nwith the ADA and that this statement was \ndocumented in the meeting notes of Dan Wold, Cedar \nIsland Elementary School Principal and Amy \nStafford, Coordinator.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 19.)  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nExhibit D is a copy of meeting notes from the October \n14, 2015 meeting.  They are unattributed/unsigned. \nHowever, it seems clear the notes were written by \nsomeone in the District because the notes originally \nhad AJT\u2019s name incorrect and later corrected with a \npen or pencil.  (Pl. Ex. D at 1.) \nAT attests that he again complained that the \nDistrict\u2019s refusal to provide AJT with a full day of \ninstruction was discriminatory on October 19 or 20, \n2015.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 21.)  There is no citation to this \ncomplaint.  AT further attests, \nFor the next six years, in countless IEP Team \nmeetings, Conciliation Conferences, and \nother school meetings with District officials, \nwe \nconsistently \ncomplained \nthat \nour \ndaughter was being discriminated against, \nregressing (or not progressing at the same \nrate as when she was in Kentucky), and that \nshe deserved a full school day similar to \ntypical students and as she received in \nKentucky. \n(Id. \u00b6 25.)  He also attests that although Emmons \ndenied knowing anything about this dispute in her \n\n29a \n \ndeposition, he and GT met with Emmons more than \nonce to complain about the District\u2019s discriminatory \ntreatment of AJT.  (Id. at 50.)  AT believes that the \nCoordinators Emmons supervises dictated AJT\u2019s \nshortened day \u201cand heard but ignored [Plaintiffs\u2019] \ndiscrimination complaints.\u201d \nA properly supported motion for summary \njudgment is not defeated by self-serving \naffidavits.  Rather, the plaintiff must \nsubstantiate \nallegations \nwith \nsufficient \nprobative evidence that would permit a \nfinding in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  A plaintiff \nmay not merely point to unsupported self-\nserving allegations, but must substantiate \nallegations \nwith \nsufficient \nprobative \nevidence that would permit a finding in the \nplaintiff\u2019s \nfavor. \n \nMere \nallegations, \nunsupported by specific facts or evidence \nbeyond \nthe \nnonmoving \nparty\u2019s \nown \nconclusions, are insufficient to withstand a \nmotion for summary judgment. \nHoeft v. Eide, No. 17-CV-2526 (MJD/LIB), 2018 WL \n6991103, at *4 (D. Minn. Oct. 25, 2018) (cleaned up; \ncitations omitted), R&R adopted, 2018 WL 6523450 \n(D. Minn. Dec. 12, 2018), aff\u2019d, 784 F. App\u2019x 967 (8th \nCir. 2019). \nHere, Plaintiffs paint with too broad a brush when \nthey discuss \u201call\u201d District officials or Fredrickson, \ntheir licensing and professional obligations, and who \ncontrolled their professional decision-making.  The \nonly evidence Plaintiffs cite in the record is the \ndeposition testimony of Emmons. Plaintiffs cite \ngenerously to this document. Plaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.  The only \u201cpolicy\u201d \nin evidence is the TSES, which, in part, details Due \n\n30a \n \nProcess in IDEA cases.  (Pl. Ex. G at 24-25 (TSES).) \nThe District appears to have followed this system by \nproviding prior written notices and offering a \nconciliation conference, mediation, a facilitated IEP \nmeeting, or a due process hearing.  (Id.; AT Aff. \u00b6 49 \n(AT stating that instead of offering a second IEP team \nmeeting on July 11, 2022, Emmons offered Plaintiffs \nthe options listed above).) \nEven though Emmons was surprised by the \nDistrict policy that states \u201c[a] pupil may receive \nspecial education services in more than one \nalternative based on the IEP,\u201d her lack of knowledge \ndid not rise to the level of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.  At most, she was negligent, which does \nnot \u201cclear the hurdle set by the explicit language of \nsection 504.\u201d  Bradley v. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Educ., 301 \nF.3d 952, 956 (8th Cir. 2002) [Bradley I].  In addition, \nwhile the Court must accept AT\u2019s accusation that \nEmmons advised he and GT to hire a PCA for AJT \nrather than seek evening schooling, while insensitive, \nthis remark did not rise to the level of bad faith or \ngross misjudgment. \nIn addition, despite Plaintiffs\u2019 statement that \n\u201cdirect, specific and repeated Parent complaints to the \nDistrict that failure to provide A.J.T. a full school day \nis disability discrimination, documented in its own \nrecords\u201d  (Doc. 38 at 6), Plaintiffs have only provided \nevidence of two documented complaints.  The October \n14, 2015 IEP meeting notes state, \u201cDad asked if we \nwill provide support in the evening.  Amy shared that \nwe don\u2019t provide both homebound and school support \n(modified).  Dad felt that this might conflict with \nADA. He wants Statute.  His position is that she can \nhandle a full day, it just can\u2019t start until Noon.\u201d  (Pl. \nEx. G at 14.)  The ADA is mentioned again in the \n\n31a \n \nNovember 16, 2015 PWN, which states that the IEP \nwill remain in effect no later than January 14 when \nthe team will re-evaluate and AT \u201cwill have the \nopportunity to look in a [sic] modified schedule \nthrough state, IDEA and ADA laws.\u201d  (Id. at 29.)  \nPlaintiffs include several IEPs and PWNs in Exhibit \nG. (Pl. Ex. G1 at 28-51.)  However, Plaintiffs do not \ncite to them. Even if Plaintiffs had done so, none of \nthe \nIEPs \nand \nPWNs \nappear \nto \nmention \ndiscrimination. \nLikewise, the District has included 11 IEPs and \nPWNs in its exhibits but Plaintiffs do not cite them.  \n(See Def. Exs. 4, 11, 16-22, 26, 31-32.)  Even if \nPlaintiffs had cited to these exhibits, they would not \nsupport their allegations.  Except for the two \nmentions of the ADA already discussed, none of these \nIEPs and PWNs state that Plaintiffs expressed \nconcern that the District was violating the ADA or \ndiscriminating against AJT.  One complaint is \ncontained in the April 30, 2018 email AT sent to \nFredrickson stating that he had sent complaints \nabout the District to various state and federal \nagencies.  (Def. Ex. 23.)  The other complaint that \nmentions discrimination was apparently resolved by \nthe appointment of Dr. Reichle to conduct an IEE. \n(Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 3-4.) \nOn the other hand, the District provides support \nfor its arguments that it has \u201cfollowed acceptable \nprofessional judgement and standards\u201d as it made \neducational decisions.  (Doc. 34 at 22.)  In response to \nconcerns from AJT\u2019s parents, the District lengthened \nAJT\u2019s school day past the ordinary 4:00 p.m. \nconclusion in elementary school and the ordinary 2:40 \np.m. conclusion in middle school.  The District also \nmodified AJT\u2019s IEPs in response to Dr. Reichle\u2019s IEE.  \n\n32a \n \n(Def. Ex. 7 (Dr. Reichle IEE), 31 (July 1, 2019 IEP \ncontaining Dr. Reichle sticky notes), 32 (Sept. 18, \n2019 IEP summarizing Dr. Reichle\u2019s IEE findings and \nincorporating several of his suggestions).)  The \nDistrict notes, however, that not even Dr. Reichle \ncollected any data about AJT\u2019s availability for \nlearning from 5:30 to 6:00 p.m.  Emmons also testified \nthat Fredrickson told her that AJT was making \nprogress when she was enrolled at Cedar Island and \nthat there were \u201ca lot of meetings with the parents or \nparent.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 98-99.) \nBoth Parties support their opinions regarding a \nreasonable number of hours for AJT\u2019s school day with \nExpert Reports.  Both Parties also cite testimony of \nDr. Breningstall.  The District cites testimony stating \nthat it would not hurt to ask if AJT\u2019s parents were \nwilling to try instruction earlier in the day.  (Def. Ex. \n6 (Breningstall Dep.) at 32.)  Plaintiffs cite Dr. \nBreningstall\u2019s administrative hearing testimony that \nstarting school before noon would lead to \u201can \ninevitable worsening of [AJT\u2019s] problems\u201d and that \nshe could not see \u201con an experimental basis exposing \n[AJT] to an inevitable worsening of her problems.\u201d  \n(Def. Ex. 5 (Breningstall Admin. Hr\u2019g Test.) at  \n273-74.) \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Emmons \ndenied ever meeting AJT\u2019s parents, she admitted \nmeeting AT during a meeting that was also attended \nby Fredrickson where AT explained why he wanted \nservices for AJT in the home and Fredrickson \nexplained why she did not agree.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons \nDep.) at 119-20.)  Emmons also stated that she \nattended \u201ca conciliation [conference]\u201d with AT.  (Id. at \n124.)  There is no mention of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or \u201cthe \nADA\u201d in the August 25, 2020 Summary of \n\n33a \n \nConciliation \nConference \nthat \ndocuments \nthis \nencounter.  (Pl. Ex. G at 50-51 (Summ. of Conciliation \nConference).)  Thus, it seems that the disconnect \nbetween Emmons\u2019 statement that she knew nothing \nabout investigations regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints \nand AT\u2019s attestation that he and GT were in meetings \nwith Emmons where they complained about AJT\u2019s \ninstruction can be resolved by this fact. \nEmmons admits being in two meetings with AT. \nThese meetings were focused on AJT\u2019s IEPs.  The \nconciliation conference was part of the District\u2019s IDEA \ndispute resolution process, which Emmons testified is \na different process from the one used to address \ndiscrimination complaints.  (Id. at 15 (TSES); Def. Ex. \n1 (Emmons Dep.) at 48.)  Therefore, the meetings she \nattended with AT likely focused on AJT\u2019s instruction \nand learning goals, not discrimination complaints.  In \naddition, resolution of this issue is not material to \nresolution of this motion.  See Amini, 643 F.3d at 1074 \n(explain that \u201ca fact is material if its resolution affects \nthe outcome of the case\u201d). \nRegarding the \u201cshifting reasons\u201d that the District \ngave for why they did not provide AJT instruction \nboth in school and in her home, in Osseo Area Schools, \nthe Court held that the services in AJT\u2019s IEP were \nlimited by the length of the traditional school day \nrather than by AJT\u2019s needs.  2022 WL 4226097, at \n*14.  However, looking at the facts in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, it is difficult to conclude that \nthe \nDistrict \nacted \nwith \nbad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment. \nToo \nmany \nof \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments \nare \nunsupported and with all the District\u2019s attempts at \nconciliation, new IEPs, and inclusion of Dr. Reichel\u2019s \nsuggestions, the Court cannot attribute \u201cwrongful \n\n34a \n \nintent\u201d to the District.  See B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (a \ndefendant\u2019s statutory noncompliance must reach a \nlevel of \u201cwrongful intent\u201d to establish \u00a7 504 or ADA \nliability); K.E. v. ISD No. 15, 647 F.3d 795, 805-06 \n(8th Cir. 2011) (under IDEA, IEP team must consider \nresults of evaluations when developing an IEP); (see \nalso Def. Exs. 7, 31, 32.)  Importantly, the District \nargues that AJT\u2019s school days are not shortened due \nto its decisions but due to AJT\u2019s health. \nLikewise, although the Court did not agree with \nthe District that the intense 1:1 and 2:1 services AJT \nreceives make up for the loss of instructional hours \nwhen the District made the same argument in Osseo \nArea Schools, 2022 WL 4226097, at *13, failure to \nprovide AJT a FAPE under the IDEA, alone, does not \nmean the District discriminated against her.3  \nBrantley, 936 F. Supp. at 657 (holding that a \u201cmere \nviolation of the IDEA\u201d does not violate \u00a7 504). \nWhile the District has not been perfect, \n[t]he reference in the Rehabilitation Act to \n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d must require, we think, \nsomething \nmore \nthan \nan \nincorrect \nevaluation, \nor \na \nsubstantively \nfaulty \nindividualized education plan, in order for \nliability to exist.  Experts often disagree on \nwhat the special needs of a handicapped \nchild are, and the educational placement of \nsuch children is often necessarily an \narguable matter.  That a court may, after \nhearing evidence and argument, come to the \nconclusion that an incorrect evaluation has \n \n3  The District\u2019s brief in this case was filed almost two \nmonths prior to the Court filing its decision in Osseo Area \nSchools. \n\n35a \n \nbeen made, and that a different placement \nmust be required under [the IDEA], is not \nnecessarily the same thing as a holding that \na handicapped child has been discriminated \nagainst solely by reason of his or her \nhandicap.  An evaluation, in other words, is \nnot discriminatory merely because a court \nwould have evaluated the child differently. \nMonahan, 687 F.2d at 1170 (deciding case based on \ncomparison to the Education for All Handicapped \nChildren \nAct \n(\u201cEAHCA\u201d), \nwhich \nis \nnow \nthe \nIndividuals \nwith \nDisabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(\u201cIDEA\u201d)). \nUnder the circumstances presented here, the \nDistrict\u2019s officials exercised professional judgment in \na way that did not depart grossly from accepted \nstandards \namong \neducational \nprofessionals \nby \nconvening multiple IEP meetings, extending AJT\u2019s \nschool day beyond the school day of her peers, \nimplementing many of Dr. Reichle\u2019s suggestions into \nAJT\u2019s IEPs, and by insuring that AJT always has at \nleast one and often two aids with her at school. \nFailure to provide extended schooling at home was \nat most negligent based on Emmons\u2019 apparent failure \nto understand the TSES.  The District states that \nAJT\u2019s day is shortened because LGS prevents her \nfrom attending school prior to noon and the District \nwill provide morning instruction should AJT\u2019s \nsituation change to allow her to attend school earlier \nin the day.4  Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to show the \n \n4  While not relevant to resolution of this motion, the Court \nnotes that although it has appealed the decision, the District has \ncomplied with its order in Osseo Area Schools insofar as it has \nbeen providing in-home instruction from 4:30 to 6:00 p.m.  See \n\n36a \n \nDistrict acted with bad faith or gross misjudgment. \nPlaintiffs have not only failed to state a prima facie \ncase under \u00a7 504 or the ADA but have also failed to \nprove there is a question of material fact regarding \nwhether they have stated such a prima facie case. \nC. Retaliation Claims \n1. Legal Standards \nTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under \n\u00a7 504, AJT\u2019s parents must show (1) they were engaged \nin a protected activity, (2) the District took some \nadverse action, and (3) a causal connection between \nthe activity and the District\u2019s action.  Albright ex rel. \nDoe v. Mountain Home Sch. Dist., 926 F.3d 942, 953 \n(8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  The Eighth Circuit \nhas not determined whether an adverse action \nagainst parents who exercised IDEA rights on behalf \nof their disabled child is an \u201cadverse action\u201d for a \n\u00a7 504 claim of retaliation.  See Bradley ex rel. Bradley \nv. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Educ., 443 F.3d 965, 976-77 (8th \nCir. 2006) [hereinafter Bradley II] (\u201cTo the extent \nthey are relying on actions taken against someone \nother than David, it is not clear that such actions can \nsupport a \u00a7 504 claim.  The [parents] have identified \nno Eighth Circuit cases where action against a parent \nwho is exercising IDEA rights on behalf of his \ndisabled child has been determined to be \u2018adverse \naction\u2019 for a \u00a7 504 claim of retaliation,\u201d but not \nreaching the issue); see also Albright, 926 F.3d at 953 \n(summarily dispatching plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 504 retaliation \n \nPl. Ex. G5 (Jan. 3, 2022 PWN) at 26 (noting that District \nprovides services from 4:30 to 6:00 p.m. \u201cas a result of the ALJ \norder dated April 21, 2021\u201d). \n\n37a \n \nclaims on procedural and factual grounds, but not \nstating whether the claims were proper). \n2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments \nPlaintiffs assert that the District retaliated \nagainst AJT\u2019s parents by (1) conducting \u201crepeated, \nexcessive, and unnecessary meetings without any \ngood faith efforts to understand and serve AJT\u2019s \nindividual needs, but were instead intended merely to \nwear her Parents down and into submission\u201d (Amend. \nCompl. \u00b6 60); (2) offering opinions regarding AJT\u2019s \nschooling and abilities that \u201cwere intended to insult, \nharass, intimidate, and coerce [her parents] into \nrelinquishing AJT\u2019s right to a full school day in a \nmanner likely to interfere with the enjoyment or \nexercise of ADA rights\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 61-63); (3) suggesting \nthat the only way AJT could have a full school day \nwas if she could attend school on a standard school \nschedule, which was contrary to medical advice and \nwas \u201cwithout teacher or evaluation support\u201d (Id. \u00b6 64); \n(4) engaging in \u201cglaring procedural violations\u201d such as \nproviding a shortened school day by \u201cadministrative \nfiat\u201d without input from anyone who worked directly \nwith AJT and based on \u201cshifting excuses unrelated to \nher medical and educational needs,\u201d which were \nmotivated by an intention to punish AJT\u2019s parents for \ntheir advocacy on behalf of their daughter, \u201cto wear \nthem down, and to force them to abandon their \nadvocacy efforts in a manner likely to interfere  \nwith the enjoyment and exercise of ADA rights\u201d (Id. \n\u00b6 65-68); (5) refusing to implement Dr. Reichle\u2019s \nrecommendations \nmade \nafter \nhis \nindependent \neducational \nevaluation \ndespite \nnot \nexpressing \ndisagreement with his recommendations \u201cto spite \n[AJT\u2019s] parents\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76); and (6) refusing to \nprovide AJT a full day of schooling when the District \n\n38a \n \nnever established that she needs a shortened day (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 77-79). \n3. Analysis \nThe Court assumes without deciding that AJT\u2019s \nparents were engaged in protected activity when they \nadvocated on behalf of AJT in the IEP process. \nHowever, the District\u2019s actions Plaintiffs assert were \nretaliatory were not.  For support, Plaintiffs\u2019 state \nonly, \u201cThere is strong evidence of retaliation and the \nconnection to protected activity,\u201d with a footnote to \n\u201c[AT] Aff.\u201d (Doc. 38 at 41 & n.181.)  Again, a self-\nserving \naffidavit, \nwithout \nfurther \nevidentiary \nsupport, cannot overcome summary judgment.  Hoeft, \n2018 WL 6991103, at *4.  Moreover, a closer look at \nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments shows they do not establish a \nprima facie case because even if the District took \nnegative actions against Plaintiffs, there is no \nevidence the actions were taken because of their \nadvocacy. \nFirst, as the District argues, it was obligated \nand/or entitled by District policy and various laws and \nrules \nto \nconvene \nIEP \nmeetings, \nconciliation \nconferences, mediations, and other informal forms of \ndispute resolution to attempt to craft AJT\u2019s IEPs.  \n(Doc. 34 at 26-27 (citing Minn. R. 3525.2810 subpt. 3; \nBradley II, 443 F.3d at 977; Dr. Breningstall Admin. \nHr\u2019g Test: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\u201d).)  In addition, as \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs insisted on more IEP \nmeetings at certain times relevant to this case.  See \nsupra part II.B. Moreover, to the extent AJT\u2019s parents \nwere upset by the early IEP proposals made by the \nDistrict in spring 2018 as the Parties were preparing \nfor AJT\u2019s transition to middle school (AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 27-\n30), the District was within its rights to propose draft \nIEPs \u201cfor review and discussion\u201d as long as AT and \n\n39a \n \nGT were allowed to comment on them.  See Blackmon \nex rel. Blackmon v. Springfield R-XII Sch. Dist., 198 \nF.3d 648, 657 (8th Cir. 1999).  Therefore, reason 1 \ndoes not establish a prima facie case of retaliation. \nMoreover, in the course of those meetings, IEP team \nmembers certainly discussed AJT\u2019s abilities and \neducational goals.  Thus, in the absence of any cited \nsupport \nfor \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments \nregarding \nharassment, insults, and intimidation, reason 2 does \nnot support a prima facie case of retaliation. \nSecond, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the \nDistrict \nadopted \nseveral \nof \nDr. \nReichle\u2019s \nrecommendations into AJT\u2019s IEP.  (Def. Exs. 7, 31, \n32.)  Therefore, reason 5 does not establish a prima \nfacie case of retaliation. \nThird, to the extent District employees were less \noutgoing and chatty after Plaintiffs filed their \nlawsuit, Plaintiffs provide no support for these \nstatements.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 47.)  Furthermore, it is human \nnature to be more circumspect when employees learn \nabout a lawsuit involving their employer and the \nsubject of their own work.  Emmons testified that she \ntold AJT\u2019s teacher \u201cto ignore the legal stuff that was \ngoing on, . . . to teach AJT well and do what she \nbelieved to be the right thing for AJT.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 1 \n(Emmons Dep.) at 104.) \nFinally, as the District asserts, even if District \nemployees stated \u201cthat the only way AJT could have \na full school day was if she could attend school on a \nstandard school schedule\u201d and the District provided a \nshortened school day by \u201cadministrative fiat\u201d without \ninput from anyone who worked directly with AJT, \nthere is no evidence these things were done in \nretaliation for AJT\u2019s parents\u2019 advocacy.  Likewise, \nthough Plaintiffs assert the District proffered \n\n40a \n \n\u201cshifting excuses unrelated to AJT\u2019s medical and \neducational needs,\u201d and the District refused to \nprovide AJT a full day of schooling when it never \nestablished that she needs one, there is no evidence \nthat the District was retaliating against AJT\u2019s \nparents for their advocacy on behalf of their daughter.  \nThroughout the briefs and voluminous exhibits \nassociated with this case, it is obvious the Parties \nhave fundamental differences of opinion regarding \nwhat constitutes a \u201cfull day\u201d of instruction for a \nstudent who does not start school until noon.  This \ndisconnect is based on the Parties\u2019 interpretations of \nthe facts and the law, not on the District\u2019s desire to \nretaliate against AJT\u2019s parents. \nEven if administrative expediency was top of mind \nfor the District when officials made scheduling \ndecisions\u2014as the Court found in Osseo Area \nSchools\u2014evidence does not support that the District \nprioritized expediency as a form of retaliation.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have failed to prove there is a causal \nconnection between actions taken by the District and \ntheir advocacy.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not only \nfailed to state a prima facie case of retaliation, \nBradley II, 443 F.3d at 976, but have also failed to \nprove there is a question of material fact regarding \nwhether they have stated such a case. \nD. IDEA Claims \nPlaintiffs have filed a claim for violations of the \nIDEA.  (Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-16.) As part of that \nclaim, they assert the District has refused to \nimplement the ALJ\u2019s Decision.  (Id. \u00b6 116.)  AT states \nthat the District failed to timely secure eye-gaze \ntechnology, assigned one of AJT\u2019s home-school \nteachers to another student and only re-instated her \n\n41a \n \nto AJT when AT told the District he felt the \nreassignment was \u201ccontinued animus and retaliation \nagainst our family,\u201d and attempted to create a home-\nschool record that will show little or no progress by \nallowing teachers to cancel or arrive late for several \nhome-school sessions and \u201csecretly tracking\u201d baseline \ndata to support that outcome.  (AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 39-47.) \nBecause the ALJ\u2019s Decision was not implemented, \nPlaintiffs filed the previously-mentioned complaint \nwith the MDE on June 9, 2021.  (Amend Compl. \n\u00b6 109.)  The MDE found the District did not violate \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision. (Def. Ex. 27.) \nOn September 13, 2022, after briefing was \ncompleted in this case, the Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \nDecision.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at *21.  \nAmong other things, the ALJ concluded that AJT \nestablished that adding \u201cthe provision of eye gaze \ntechnology . . . would result in an educational \nprogram that is responsive to her individual needs \n. . . .\u201d  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 20.) \nPlaintiffs have already filed one Motion for an \nOrder to Show Cause why [the District] Should Not \nbe Found in Contempt [of the Court\u2019s Order Affirming \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision].  Osseo Area Schs. II, 2022 WL \n17082826, at *1.  Plaintiffs asserted that the District \nwas not complying with the Court\u2019s Order affirming \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision regarding compensatory hours of \neducation.  Id. at *1-2.  Now that the Court has \naffirmed the ALJ\u2019s Decision, the appropriate way to \nseek relief for a violation of that Order is to file \nanother motion for an order to show cause. \nFiling a new IDEA claim in this or another case \nwas never the appropriate way to obtain relief.  As the \nDistrict states, Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claim \u201cis a thinly \nveiled attempt to re-litigate the issues . . . from the \n\n42a \n \ndue process hearing.\u201d  (Doc. 34 at 30.)  Except for \nlimited exceptions not relevant here, federal courts do \nnot have original jurisdiction over claims brought \npursuant to the IDEA.  Blackmon, 198 F.3d at 655-56 \n(discussing exhaustion); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).   \nIn addition, the statute of limitations for filing \nappeals of IDEA decisions is 90 days.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B).  Even assuming jurisdiction is proper \nin this Court, this \u201cappeal,\u201d filed 104 days after the \nALJ\u2019s Decision, is untimely. \nFinally, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction \nover this claim, to the extent Plaintiffs wished to \nassert the claim in this Court, they had to do so as a \ncompulsory counterclaim because the claim clearly \narises out of the same transaction or occurrence that \nwas the subject matter of Osseo Area Schools and no \nadditional parties are required over whom the Court \ncannot acquire jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. \n13(a)(1).  A compulsory counterclaim not asserted is \nwaived.  Schinzing v. Mid\u2013States Stainless, Inc., 415 \nF.3d 807, 813 (8th Cir. 2005).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaim is barred. \nIV. \nORDER \nBased upon the files, records, and proceedings \nherein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \nDefendants\u2019 Osseo Area Schools, Independent \nSchool District No. 279 and Osseo School Board\u2019s \nMotion for Summary Judgement (Doc. 31) is \nGRANTED. \n\n43a \n \nLET \nJUDGMENT \nBE \nENTERED \nACCORDINGLY. \nDated: February 1, 2023  \ns/Michael J.

Her parents asked Osseo Area \n\n50a \n \nSchools (the District) to provide evening instruction, \nbut believing it had no obligation to educate A.J.T. \noutside of regular school hours, the District refused. \nThe district court1 concluded that this denied A.J.T. a \n\u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  The \nDistrict appeals, and we affirm. \nI \nA.J.T. has a rare form of epilepsy and requires \nassistance with everyday tasks like walking and \ntoileting.  She has seizures throughout the day, and \nthey are so frequent in the morning that she can\u2019t \nattend school before noon.  But she\u2019s alert and able to \nlearn until about 6:00 p.m. \nBefore moving to Minnesota in 2015, A.J.T.\u2019s \nKentucky school district provided an individualized \neducation program (IEP), see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d), that \nincluded evening instruction at home.  But the \nDistrict wasn\u2019t as accommodating.  Year after year, it \ndenied \nA.J.T.\u2019s \nparents\u2019 \nrequests \nfor \nevening \ninstruction with a series of shifting explanations.  The \nfirst year, it claimed that state law does not require \nit.  The next year, it said it needed to avoid setting \nunfavorable precedent for itself and other districts. \nAnd later, it said that the home environment would \nbe too restrictive and that it needed \u201cdata to \nsubstantiate this programming change.\u201d \nFrom 2015 to 2018, while A.J.T. was in elementary \nschool, the District provided intensive one-on-one \ninstruction for 4.25 hours each school day.2  Then, in \n \n1  The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District \nJudge for the District of Minnesota. \n2  The District initially offered instruction from 12:00 p.m. \nto 4:00 p.m.\u2014the elementary school\u2019s standard end time.  But \n\n51a \n \n2018, the District prepared for A.J.T. to enter middle \nschool.  The middle school\u2019s standard day ended at \n2:40 p.m., so the District proposed cutting back her \nday to about 3 hours.  Despite the even shorter day, it \nagain rejected her parents\u2019 request for evening \ninstruction.  It also rejected their various proposals to \nat least maintain her 4.25-hour day, including a \nproposal to continue keeping her at the elementary \nschool. \nRealizing that an agreement was beyond reach, \nA.J.T.\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Minnesota \nDepartment of Education.  Their complaint kept \nA.J.T.\u2019s 4.25-hour school day in place under the \u201cstay-\nput\u201d provision of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j); see also \nHale ex rel. Hale v. Poplar Bluff R\u2013I Sch. Dist., 280 \nF.3d 831, 833 (8th Cir. 2002) (per curiam), and led to \na due process hearing before an administrative law \njudge (ALJ), see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A). \nAfter a five-day evidentiary hearing, the ALJ \nconcluded that the District had denied A.J.T. a FAPE. \nThe ALJ found that District officials improperly made \n\u201cmaintain[ing] the regular hours of the school\u2019s \nfaculty\u201d \nthe \n\u201cprevailing \nand \nparamount \nconsideration\u201d over A.J.T.\u2019s needs and ordered the \nDistrict to provide 495 hours of compensatory \neducation and add certain services to her IEP, \nincluding at-home instruction from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 \np.m. each school day. \n \nA.J.T.\u2019s parents picked her up at 3:30 p.m. each day because they \nwere concerned about her safety navigating the halls while other \nstudents were being dismissed, so the District later extended her \nschool day by 15 minutes. \n\n52a \n \nThe District sought judicial review, see id. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), and after receiving the administrative \nrecord and providing an opportunity to present \nadditional evidence, the district court agreed with the \nALJ, id. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C); see also Minnetonka Pub. \nSchs., Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 276 v. M.L.K. ex rel. S.K., \n42 F.4th 847, 852 (8th Cir. 2022) (standard of review \nin the district court).  Specifically, the court found \nthat after moving to the District, A.J.T. made \nprogress in several areas like her desire and intent to \ncommunicate, use of eye gaze technology, ability to \nfeed herself, and handwashing.  But her overall \nprogress was de minimis, and she regressed in other \nareas like communicating using hand signs, initiating \nand returning greetings using a prerecorded button \nswitch, and toileting.  The court also found that A.J.T. \nwould have made more progress if she had received \nevening instruction and that a three- or four-hour \nschool day was insufficient to pursue many expert-\nrecommended goals.  Ultimately, the court concluded \nthat the District did not meet its burden to show that \nthe ALJ erred in finding that the District denied \nA.J.T. a FAPE.  See E.S. v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 196, \nRosemount\u2013Apple Valley\u2013Eagan, 135 F.3d 566, 569 \n(8th Cir. 1998) (burden of proof). \nII \nUnder the IDEA, children with disabilities are \nentitled to a FAPE.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A).  To get \nthere, school districts must identify and evaluate a \nstudent\u2019s need for special education services and work \nwith a team\u2014which typically includes teachers, \nschool officials, and the student\u2019s parents\u2014to create \nan annual IEP.  Id. \u00a7 1414(a)\u2013(d).  The IEP must \ninclude a statement of the student\u2019s academic and \nfunctional performance, describe how her disability \n\n53a \n \naffects her learning, set out measurable goals, and \ntrack her progress.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III); \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE\u20131, 580 U.S. 386, 391, 137 S.Ct. 988, 197 L.Ed.2d \n335 (2017).  And to be substantively adequate, it must \nbe \u201ctailored to the unique needs\u201d of the individual \nstudent and \u201cappropriately ambitious,\u201d meaning it \nmust be \u201creasonably calculated to enable a child to \nmake \nprogress \nappropriate \nin \nlight \nof \n[her] \ncircumstances\u201d and give her a \u201cchance to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 401\u2013\n04, 137 S.Ct. 988 (citation omitted). \nJudicial review in IDEA cases \u201cis, in reality, quite \nnarrow.\u201d  Petersen v. Hastings Pub. Schs., 31 F.3d \n705, 707 (8th Cir. 1994). Courts are limited to \nreviewing whether the school district followed the \nIDEA\u2019s procedures and whether the student\u2019s IEP \nprovided a FAPE.  Id. (quoting Bd. of Educ. of \nHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. \n176, 206\u201307, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)).  \nA district court must \u201cmake an independent decision, \nbased on a preponderance of the evidence, whether \nthe IDEA was violated,\u201d but it \u201cmust nonetheless give \ndue weight to the administrative proceedings.\u201d  \nM.L.K., 42 F.4th at 852 (citation omitted).  On appeal, \nwe review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear \nerror and its determination of whether the school \nprovided a FAPE de novo.  Id. \nAs an initial matter, we reject the notion that the \nIDEA\u2019s reach is limited to the regular hours of the \nschool day.  Neither the District nor amici identify \nanything in the IDEA implying\u2014let alone stating\u2014\nthat a school district is only obligated to provide a \nFAPE if it can do so between the bells.  So we wade \n\n54a \n \ninto the finer details of A.J.T.\u2019s IEPs to determine \nwhether she received a FAPE despite the short day. \nSeveral things convince us that she did not:  First, \nA.J.T. made de minimis progress overall.  Second, she \nregressed in toileting, and at one point, the District \neven removed the toileting goal from her IEP because \nthere was not enough time in the short school day.  \nAnd third, A.J.T. would have made more progress \nwith evening instruction. The District disputes each \npoint, so we discuss them in turn. \nA. \nThe District argues that the district court clearly \nerred in finding that A.J.T.\u2019s overall progress was de \nminimis.  It says that her progress was significant in \n\u201cmany\u201d areas and that even minimal progress was \n\u201cremarkable\u201d \ngiven \nher \ndisability. \n \nWe \nare \nunconvinced. \nThe District cites only slight progress in a few \nareas, and even one of the District\u2019s own experts \nagreed that A.J.T.\u2019s progress was minimal.  According \nto the District\u2019s progress reports, A.J.T. met none of \nher annual goals in 2016 or 2017.  By the end of 2018, \nshe had met a few short-term objectives3 but still \nhadn\u2019t met any annual goals.  The record contains no \nprogress reports for 2019.  And in 2020, she again met \nonly a few objectives and not a single goal.  Based on \nthis, the district court did not clearly err in finding \nthat A.J.T.\u2019s overall progress was de minimis. \n \n3  A.J.T.\u2019s progress reports consist of multiple \u201cannual \ngoals,\u201d each of which include several \u201cshort term objectives.\u201d \n\n55a \n \nA.J.T.\u2019s limited progress is strong evidence that \nthe District denied her a FAPE,4 as a student making \n\u201cmerely more than de minimis progress from year to \nyear can hardly be said to have been offered an \neducation at all.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 402\u201303, 137 \nS.Ct. 988 (cleaned up) (holding that the FAPE \nstandard is \u201cmarkedly more demanding\u201d). \nB. \nThe District also quibbles with the district court\u2019s \nfindings that A.J.T. regressed in toileting and that the \nDistrict removed her toileting goal for lack of time.  It \nquestions whether A.J.T. ever had success voiding on \nthe toilet and claims that the IEP team removed the \ntoileting goal in 2017 because it didn\u2019t expect that she \ncould make any progress.  The record tells a different \nstory. \n \n4  The District says that we should nonetheless ignore \nA.J.T.\u2019s de minimis progress overall and her regression in \ntoileting because \u201c[a]n IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective, and \nwe must take into account what was, and was not, objectively \nreasonable when the snapshot was taken, that is, at the time the \nIEP was promulgated.\u201d  K.E. ex rel. K.E. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. \n15, 647 F.3d 795, 808 (8th Cir. 2011) (cleaned up) (citation \nomitted).  But here, the District had more and more information \nabout A.J.T.\u2019s instructional needs and insufficient progress each \nyear.  This is not a case where it only became apparent that the \nstudent\u2019s IEP was inappropriate after the fact.  Cf. id. (holding \nthat \u201cit would be improper for us to judge [the student\u2019s] IEPs in \nhindsight\u201d because the school district had \u201ccontradictory \ninformation about whether [the student] suffered from bipolar \ndisorder\u201d when it drafted them).  Rather, A.J.T.\u2019s limited \nprogress and regression was both predictable and known, so it is \nproperly considered as an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in our analysis.  See \nC.B. ex rel. B.B. v. Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 636 F.3d 981, 989 \n(8th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). \n\n56a \n \nA behavior analyst who worked with A.J.T. in \nKentucky testified that she was voiding on the toilet \n45% of the time by the end of their work together, and \nA.J.T.\u2019s father testified that when they moved to the \nDistrict, she was voiding on the toilet 50% of the time \nat home and was making progress voiding on the \ntoilet at school.  By 2016, District records noted that \nA.J.T. was having \u201csome successes\u201d voiding on the \ntoilet but was not meeting her goal of a 50% success \nrate.  Then, in 2017, District officials observed that \nA.J.T.\u2019s success was \u201cinconsistent\u201d and decided to cut \nthe goal \u201cdue to the time constraint of [her] shortened \nday.\u201d  The next year, the District changed course and \nreinstated the goal, noting her \u201cneed for instruction in \nactivities of daily living\u201d and that \u201c[w]ith fewer trips \nto the bathroom,\u201d she was now having \u201cminimal \nsuccess.\u201d  The District\u2019s records are clear that A.J.T. \nregressed in toileting and that it removed her \ntoileting goal for lack of time in the short day\u2014not for \nlack of ability to improve. \nA.J.T.\u2019s toileting ability is essential for her to live \na healthy and dignified life, and the District\u2019s failure \nto take steps to address that goal violated its \nobligation to provide a FAPE. \nC. \nFinally, the District says that the district court \nerred by considering expert testimony that A.J.T. \nwould have benefitted from evening instruction \nbecause doing so amounted to requiring it to \n\u201cmaximize a student\u2019s potential or provide the best \npossible education at public expense.\u201d  Albright ex rel. \nDoe v. Mountain Home Sch. Dist., 926 F.3d 942, 950 \n(8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). \n\n57a \n \nBut asking whether A.J.T. would have made more \nprogress with evening instruction isn\u2019t about \nmaximizing her potential\u2014it\u2019s about whether the \nDistrict\u2019s purely administrative decision not to \nprovide evening education caused her de minimis \nprogress and regression.

This is the pivotal issue the Supreme Court is being asked to resolve. My predictive model will need to focus on how the Court might interpret these statutes and whether they will endorse this specific standard, which the Eighth Circuit applied, or a different, potentially less stringent one. Key areas for investigation remain the specific arguments from the petitioner and respondent, the extent of any circuit split on this standard, and the position of the Solicitor General, if any. My immediate goal is to verify and deepen this understanding by analyzing the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My prior understanding was that the central legal question in *A. J. T. v. Osseo Area Schools* is whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require plaintiffs to meet a heightened \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard for discrimination claims in educational settings. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has now provided substantial evidence to confirm and deepen this belief, outlining the petitioner's core legal strategy and the specific landscape of the dispute.\n\nMy beliefs have been updated with the following specific information:\n\n1.  **Confirmation and Framing of the Legal Question:** The petition explicitly frames the \"Question Presented\" as: \"Whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require children with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely stringent 'bad faith or gross misjudgment' standard when seeking relief for discrimination relating to their education.\" This confirms my initial assessment is correct and central to the case.\n\n2.  **Evidence of a Deep Circuit Split:** My previous uncertainty about a circuit split has been resolved. The petitioner asserts a clear and \"entrenched 5-2 circuit split\" on this exact question, a primary factor the Supreme Court considers when granting certiorari.\n    *   **Circuits applying the stringent standard (The 5):** The petition identifies the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits as having adopted the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard for education-related disability claims.\n    *   **Circuits applying the general standard (The 2):** The petition identifies the Third and Ninth Circuits as rejecting this heightened standard, instead applying the same, more lenient standards to all ADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs, regardless of the educational context.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Core Arguments:** I now have a clear view of the petitioner's legal arguments for why the Supreme Court should take the case and rule in their favor:\n    *   **Atextual Standard:** The petitioner argues forcefully that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard has \"absolutely no basis in the relevant statutory text.\" They highlight that the Eighth Circuit panel itself noted the standard lacks \"any anchor in statutory text,\" a powerful admission that will be central to a textualist analysis.\n    *   **Inconsistent Application:** The standard creates an arbitrary distinction where children with disabilities in schools face a higher burden of proof than any other plaintiff under the same statutes, including adults in universities or individuals in other public settings.\n    *   **Judicial Discomfort with Precedent:** The petitioner signals that the lower courts are themselves questioning the standard. They point to the Eighth Circuit panel's sharp criticism of its own binding precedent (*Monahan v. Nebraska*), the dissent by three judges from the denial of rehearing en banc, and similar \"discomfort\" expressed by the Sixth Circuit in *Knox County v. M.Q.* (2023).\n\n4.  **Identification of Key Precedents:**\n    *   The origin of the contested standard is identified as the Eighth Circuit's 1982 decision in ***Monahan v. Nebraska***. The petitioner's case will likely involve a direct challenge to the reasoning and continued viability of this 40-year-old precedent.\n    *   The petitioner strategically cites recent Supreme Court decisions like ***Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools*** (2023) and ***Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools*** (2017) to frame this issue as part of an ongoing line of cases where the Court has had to intervene to protect the rights of students with disabilities.\n\nMy predictive model is now significantly more refined. The existence of a clear, acknowledged 5-2 circuit split on a question of statutory interpretation, combined with criticism of the majority rule from within the very circuits that apply it, makes it substantially more likely the Court will grant certiorari. The petitioner's reliance on textualist arguments aligns with the interpretive methods of several current justices. The most critical unknown variables for predicting the final ruling are now the respondent's defense of the *Monahan* standard and the position the Solicitor General will take if invited to file a brief.",

It will reveal how the respondent frames the case, whether they contest the circuit split, argue this is a poor vehicle, or present a substantive defense of the lower court's standard. This information is essential for updating my beliefs about both the likelihood of certiorari and the potential merits outcome. Without it, any prediction is fundamentally incomplete.\n\nDesign EIG is 0.7 because this action provides a crucial data point for a core principle of SCOTUS prediction: the necessity of symmetrical information gathering. It reinforces the strategy that one must always analyze the respondent's brief to properly weigh a petitioner's claim of a circuit split.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

My understanding of the legal landscape, as shaped by the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, is unchanged.\n\nMy current, stable beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Central Legal Question:** The case squarely presents the question of whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require plaintiffs in educational discrimination cases to meet a heightened \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, a standard the petitioner argues is atextual and improperly created by the judiciary.\n\n2.  **Acknowledged Circuit Split:** There is a clear and \"entrenched 5-2 circuit split\" on this issue.\n    *   **Majority Rule (Applying the Standard):** The Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits require plaintiffs to show \"bad faith or gross misjudgment.\"\n    *   **Minority Rule (Rejecting the Standard):** The Third and Ninth Circuits apply the general, more lenient discrimination standards applicable in all other ADA/Rehabilitation Act contexts.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Core Arguments:** The petitioner's strategy relies on three main pillars:\n    *   **Textualism:** The \"bad faith\" standard has no basis in the statutory text of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. The petitioner highlights the Eighth Circuit's own admission of this fact.\n    *   **Inconsistency:** The standard creates an arbitrary and unsupported distinction, imposing a higher burden on children in schools than on any other group protected by the same laws.\n    *   **Judicial Discomfort:** The petitioner points to growing criticism of the standard from within the circuits that apply it, including the Eighth Circuit panel in this case and the Sixth Circuit, suggesting the precedent is ripe for reconsideration.\n\n4.  **Key Precedents:** The case revolves around the validity of the Eighth Circuit's 1982 decision in ***Monahan v. Nebraska***, which established the contested standard. The petitioner also situates this case within a line of recent Supreme Court decisions, like ***Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools*** and ***Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools***, that have affirmed the rights of students with disabilities.\n\nThe latest observation confirms that my current knowledge is one-sided, based entirely on the petitioner's perspective. It correctly identifies the most significant source of uncertainty in my predictive model: the lack of the respondent's counter-arguments. My next priority is to acquire and analyze the respondent's Brief in Opposition to understand how Osseo Area Schools will defend the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, whether they will contest the existence or significance of the circuit split, and if they will argue this case is a poor vehicle for resolving the question. Until that information is processed, my prediction regarding the likelihood of certiorari and the ultimate outcome remains based on an incomplete, petitioner-focused dataset.",

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) fundamentally alters my understanding of this case by providing the critical counter-arguments I was previously missing. My beliefs are no longer one-sided and have evolved significantly, particularly regarding the cert-worthiness of the central legal question.\n\nMy updated beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Contested Legal Question and Framing:** While the petitioner frames the case around the legitimacy of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, the respondent (Osseo Area Schools) reframes the issue entirely. They characterize the question as whether the petitioner failed to establish \"discriminatory intent,\" a more general and less controversial legal concept. The respondent argues this case falls into a \"conceptual peculiarity\" where an ADA/Rehab Act claim directly challenges the provision of services mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), justifying a unique standard. This strategic reframing attempts to shift the debate from whether a specific, judicially-created test is valid to whether a general intent requirement was met.\n\n2.  **The Circuit Split is Now Disputed:** My prior belief in a \"clear and entrenched 5-2 circuit split\" is now directly challenged. The BIO argues there is **\"No Meaningful Circuit Split.\"** This is the most significant new piece of information affecting my prediction.\n    *   **For Damages Claims:** The respondent contends that the split is a matter of \"form over substance.\" They argue that while circuits use \"different verbal formulations,\" they all substantively agree that a *high* standard of discriminatory intent is required and that it involves a deviation from accepted professional practices.\n    *   **For Injunctive Relief Claims:** The respondent asserts there is **\"no disagreement at all,\"** claiming that no circuit court has ever allowed a claim challenging the substance of an IEP to proceed under the ADA/Rehab Act without proof of discriminatory intent. They argue the petitioner's cited cases from the Third and Ninth Circuits are taken out of context or involve different types of discrimination claims.\n\n3.  **Strong \"Poor Vehicle\" Argument:** The respondent has constructed a powerful argument that this case is a poor vehicle for resolving the legal question, which significantly decreases the likelihood of a cert grant. This argument has two prongs:\n    *   **Factual Unsuitability:** The respondent portrays the District not as discriminatory, but as having made \"persistent efforts\" and \"reasonably responded\" to the petitioner's needs, leading to the student's continued progress. They argue that the petitioner would lose on the merits even under the more lenient standard she advocates for, making any ruling on the standard by the Supreme Court effectively an advisory opinion in this context.\n    *   **Diminished Stakes:** The BIO highlights that the petitioner has *already received* injunctive relief and compensation for the denial of a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) through a separate legal action. This suggests the petitioner has already been made whole, reducing the urgency and practical impact of a Supreme Court decision in her favor in this specific case.\n\n4.  **A Coherent Defense of the Heightened Standard:** I now understand the respondent's justification for the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. It is not defended on textualist grounds, but on structural and prudential ones.\n    *   **Harmonizing Statutes:** Citing *Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist.*, the respondent argues the standard is a \"sensible remedial scheme\" developed by courts to manage the overlap between the IDEA's detailed procedural framework and the broad anti-discrimination mandates of the ADA/Rehab Act.\n    *   **Deference to Educators:** The standard is presented as necessary to uphold the principle of deference to the \"expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities,\" a principle the Supreme Court endorsed in cases like *Endrew F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1* and which originates from the foundational case in this area, *Monahan v. Nebraska*.\n\n5.  **Key Signals and Personnel:** The respondent is represented by Lisa S. Blatt of Williams & Connolly, a highly credible and successful Supreme Court advocate. Her involvement is a strong signal that the respondent is taking the petition seriously and has invested in a top-tier defense. Her arguments, especially the nuanced attack on the existence of a meaningful circuit split, are likely to be very persuasive to the Court and its clerks.\n\nIn sum, the BIO has moved my understanding from a simple petitioner-versus-the-circuits narrative to a much more complex legal battle. The respondent's arguments effectively muddy the waters on the circuit split and present a compelling case that these specific facts are a poor foundation upon which to decide a major legal question. My confidence in a potential cert grant has decreased, as the respondent has provided the Court with several strong, conventional reasons to deny the petition.",

My current belief state is defined by the powerful arguments made in the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO), which have cast significant doubt on the cert-worthiness of the petition by attacking the circuit split and framing the case as a poor vehicle. My prediction is currently in suspense, awaiting the petitioner's response. The Petitioner's Reply Brief is the one and only opportunity to counter these arguments. Therefore, reading it will directly resolve the primary sources of my uncertainty. It will either confirm the case is likely dead on arrival (if the reply is weak) or revive the possibility of a grant (if the reply is strong), causing a massive update to my posterior belief. For Task EIG, this is a perfect 1.0.\n\nFor Design EIG, this action is also highly valuable. The cert-stage process is a dialog, and analyzing the complete sequence (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) is fundamental to building a robust predictive model. This case, featuring top-tier counsel and a classic 'no split/bad vehicle' defense, provides a textbook example of this dynamic. Observing how the petitioner attempts to rebut these specific, common, and powerful arguments will refine my model for evaluating the persuasiveness of cert-stage briefing in general. This is a core competency for a BOED agent in this domain, making the design gain very high, rated at 0.9.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore extremely high, as the action is both critical for the immediate task and a crucial learning opportunity for my overall design.",

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (Pet.App.44a-45a) is not published, \nbut available at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota \ngranting \nrespondents\u2019 \nmotion \nfor \nsummary judgment (Pet.App.6a-43a) is not published \nbut available at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nentered \njudgment \non \nMarch 21, 2024 (Pet.App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(Pet.App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In the \ndecision below, the Eighth Circuit held that for \ndiscrimination claims \u201cbased on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, these statutes \nare violated only if school officials acted with \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  That test \narbitrarily departs from the more lenient standards \nthat all courts\u2014including the Eighth Circuit\u2014apply \nto ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought by \nother plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (Pet.App.44a-45a) is not published, \nbut available at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota \ngranting \nrespondents\u2019 \nmotion \nfor \nsummary judgment (Pet.App.6a-43a) is not published \nbut available at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nentered \njudgment \non \nMarch 21, 2024 (Pet.App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(Pet.App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon \nCmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 158 (2017).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nresolving IEP-related disputes between families and \nschools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows courts to \naward only limited \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, \n15-16 (1993).  Such relief may include an \u201cinjunction\u201d \nor \u201creimbursement\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \n\n6 \n \n \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protections to victims of disability \ndiscrimination.  Unlike the IDEA, which applies only \nto the education of school-age children, the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act protect all Americans, both inside \nand outside the school setting.  As relevant here, the \nADA states that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act contains a similarly phrased \nprohibition that applies to recipients of federal \nfunding.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nDespite some \u201coverlap in coverage\u201d with the IDEA, \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act do different work \nwhen it comes to primary and secondary schools\u2019 \ntreatment of children with disabilities.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat \n170-71. \n \nWhereas \n\u201cthe \nIDEA \nguarantees \nindividually tailored educational services\u201d\u2014namely, \nan IEP designed to ensure that the child receives a \nFAPE\u2014the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cpromise \nnon-discriminatory access\u201d to education.  Id.  A school \ndistrict can therefore \u201cestablish a FAPE in compliance \nwith the IDEA, while nevertheless engaging in \ndiscriminatory \nconduct \nunder \nthe \nADA \n[and \nRehabilitation Act].\u201d  Lartigue v. Northside Indep. \nSch. Dist., 100 F.4th 510, 521 (5th Cir. 2024); accord \nLe Pape v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 103 F.4th 966, \n981 (3d Cir. 2024). \n\n7 \n \n \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nthat would enable people with disabilities to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program is \ndisability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170; see \nalso id. at 159-60.  Indeed, since the Rehabilitation \nAct became law in 1973, courts have uniformly \nunderstood that \u201ca refusal to accommodate the needs \nof a disabled person\u201d can \u201camount[] to discrimination \nagainst \nthe \nhandicapped\u201d \nif \nthe \nrequested \naccommodations are reasonable.  Se. Cmty. Coll. v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 412-13 (1979); accord Choate, \n469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.21. In 1990, Congress \nreaffirmed and adopted this longstanding principle \nwhen enacting the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2) \n(providing that people with disabilities are \u201cqualified\u201d \nfor public services, programs, or activities if they can \nparticipate \nwith \n\u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d);  \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) (requiring \u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d \nwhen \n\u201cnecessary \nto \navoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\u201d).    \nUnder both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \naccommodations are reasonable so long as they do not \nentail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the service in \nquestion \nor \nimpose \n\u201cundue \nfinancial \n[or] \nadministrative burdens\u201d on the regulated party.   \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.150(a)(3) (ADA); see also id. \u00a7 41.53 \n(Rehabilitation Act); Choate, 469 U.S. at 300 & n.20; \nK.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin Unified Sch. Dist., 725 \nF.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2013); Gorman v. Bartch, \n152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998). \n2.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cexpressly \nincorporate[]\u201d the same \u201crights and remedies provided \nunder Title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \n\n8 \n \n \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022).  The ADA provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in\u201d the \nRehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the remedies, procedures, \nand rights this subchapter provides to any person \nalleging discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133.  And the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, states that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth\u201d in Title VI \n\u201cshall be available to any person aggrieved by\u201d \ndisability discrimination inflicted by a person or \nentity subject to the Rehabilitation Act.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \nAccordingly, both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nfollow Title VI in \u201cauthoriz[ing] individuals,\u201d \nincluding children with disabilities, \u201cto seek redress \nfor violations\u201d by \u201cbringing suits\u201d for both \u201cinjunctive \nrelief\u201d and \u201cmoney damages.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160; \nsee also Alexander v.

In cases outside the educational context, \nthe courts of appeals unanimously agree that ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs can establish a \nstatutory violation\u2014and with it, eligibility for \ninjunctive relief\u2014if they show, on the merits, that the \ndefendant \nfailed \nto \nprovide \na \nreasonable \naccommodation to a covered person with a disability.1  \n \n1   See, e.g., Sosa v.

Servs., Inc. v.

Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 \nF.3d 248, 262 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  \nBecause \u201cprivate individuals [may] not recover \ncompensatory damages under Title VI except for \nintentional discrimination,\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. \nat 282-83, and because the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, supra \nat 7-8, ADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs may not \nobtain damages without proving that the defendant \nacted with a wrongful state of mind.  See S.H., 729 \nF.3d at 262.   \nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of courts hold that this intent \nrequirement for damages demands proof that the \ndefendant \nwas, \nat \na \nminimum, \n\u201cdeliberately \nindifferent\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected \nrights.  Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2015) (Jackson, J.) (collecting \ncases).

Although the circuits largely agree on the \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims outside the educational setting, they are \ndivided over whether those same standards apply to \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related \nclaims.   \nThe Third and Ninth Circuits apply the same \nstandards in these cases as they do in all others. \nPet.17-19.3  So do various district courts sitting in \nother circuits.

Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982).  There, the court \naffirmed the dismissal without prejudice of a \u201ccryptic\u201d \nRehabilitation Act claim alleging an \u201cimproper \neducational placement.\u201d  Id. at 1169-70.  To offer \u201ca \nfew words [of] guidance\u201d on remand, the court opined \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment should be \nshown\u201d before a Rehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be \nmade out\u201d in \u201cthe context of education of handicapped \nchildren.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  This heightened standard \nrequires proof that school officials departed so \n\u201csubstantially from accepted professional judgment, \npractice or standards as to demonstrate\u201d that they \n\u201cactually did not base the decision on [professional] \njudgment.\u201d  Est. of Barnwell ex rel. Barnwell v. \nWatson, 880 F.3d 998, 1004 (8th Cir. 2018). \nMonahan justified this harsh test based on a \nperceived \u201cduty to harmonize the Rehabilitation Act\u201d \nwith the IDEA\u2019s predecessor\u2014the EHA\u2014given that \nthe EHA specifically addressed the educational needs \nof children with disabilities.  687 F.2d at 1171.  \nAccording to Monahan, a heightened standard was \nnecessary to \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \n \n5  See, e.g., C.L. v. Scarsdale Union Free Sch. Dist., 744 \nF.3d 826, 841 (2d Cir. 2014); Sellers ex rel. Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of \nthe City of Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir. 1998); D.A. ex \nrel. Latasha A. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 629 F.3d 450, 454-55 \n(5th Cir. 2010); G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, 635 \n(6th Cir. 2013); Pet.App.5a & n.2. \n\n12 \n \n \nintended by Congress\u201d and achieve \u201cwhat [the court] \nbelieve[d] to be a proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id.  Monahan \ntherefore construed the EHA to limit the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder the Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nsubsequently \nextended \nMonahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard \nto claims brought by children under the ADA.  See \nHoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 283, \n103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th Cir. 1996).   \n4.  Two years after Monahan, Congress amended \nthe EHA by enacting what is now Section 1415(l) of \nthe IDEA.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161.  That provision, \nas amended, states in relevant part:  \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  In other words, Congress \ndeclared that the IDEA does not \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the \nability of children with disabilities to obtain relief \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \n \nNevertheless, the Eighth Circuit has continued to \nrely on the IDEA to restrict ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct relief for school-age children with disabilities by \nlimiting liability to cases involving \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d by school officials.  See, e.g., B.M. ex rel. \nMiller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, \n\n13 \n \n \n887 (8th Cir. 2013); M.P. ex rel. K. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. \nNo. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 981-82 (8th Cir. 2003).  So have \nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits.  Supra \nat 10-11 & n.5 (collecting cases).  \nB. Factual Background \nBecause this case comes to the Court on the \nDistrict\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the evidence \nmust be viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to [Ava].\u201d  \nTolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 657 (2014) (per curiam).  \nThat \nevidence \nshows \nthat \nthe \nDistrict \nhas \nsystematically discriminated against Ava in violation \nof the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act.  \nSince Ava was six months old, she has suffered \nfrom \u201ca rare form of epilepsy\u201d known as Lennox-\nGastaut Syndrome.  Pet.App.6a, 50a.  Ava\u2019s condition \nseverely impacts her ability to function.  For example, \nAva \nhas \n\u201csignificantly \ndiminished \nintellectual \ncapacities\u201d and she requires \u201cassistance with \neveryday tasks like walking and toileting.\u201d  Id.  Ava \nalso suffers from \u201cseizures throughout the day.\u201d  Id. \nat 50a.  Her seizures \u201ccreat[e] safety concerns and \ninterfer[e] with her capacity to learn.\u201d  JA515.  The \nseizures \u201care so frequent in the morning that [Ava] \ncan\u2019t attend school before noon.\u201d  Pet.App.50a.  From \nthen on, however, Ava is \u201calert and able to learn until \nabout 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id.   \nAva\u2019s parents and physicians recognized this \npattern early on and developed a plan to help her \nachieve her educational and personal goals.  JA479-\n81, 510-16.  Since preschool, Ava has slept late and \navoided activities before midday.  JA479-81.  And \nuntil Ava was 10 years old, educational professionals \nrespected these limitations.  See, e.g., JA497-507.  \nIndeed, Ava\u2019s public school district in Kentucky \n\n14 \n \n \nadequately addressed her needs, including by \nproviding \n\u201cevening \ninstruction \nat \nhome.\u201d  \nPet.App.50a.   \nIn 2015, when Ava was ten years old, her family \nmoved to Minnesota.  But her new school district \nthere, respondent Osseo Area Schools, refused to \nprovide her with the same accommodation.  Id.  \u201cYear \nafter year,\u201d the District \u201cdenied [Ava\u2019s] parents\u2019 \nrequests for evening instruction\u201d based on \u201ca series of \nshifting explanations.\u201d  Id.  Initially, the District \n\u201cclaimed that state law d[id] not require\u201d adjusting \nAva\u2019s instructional hours.  Id.  Then, the District \u201csaid \nit needed to avoid setting unfavorable precedent for \nitself and other districts.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd later, it said that \nthe home environment would be too restrictive,\u201d while \ndemanding more \u201cdata\u201d to justify a \u201cprogramming \nchange.\u201d  Id.   \nAll told, over her first three years in Minnesota, \nAva received only 4.25 hours of instruction per day\u2014\njust 65% of what her non-disabled peers received.  Id.; \nsee id. at 8a.  Rather than provide a full day of \nprofessional instruction by a teacher, the District \nopined that Ava\u2019s parents \u201cshould hire a personal care \nattendant after school hours.\u201d  JA495. \nIn 2018, the District insisted on truncating Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time even further.  As Ava prepared to \nenter middle school, the District abruptly amended \nher IEP to \u201ccut[] back her day to about 3 hours\u201d\u2014less \nthan half of what her peers would receive.  \nPet.App.51a; see id. at 8a.  Despite this latest setback, \nAva\u2019s parents continued to seek a workable \ncompromise with the District.  They made \u201cvarious \nproposals to at least maintain [Ava\u2019s] 4.25-hour day,\u201d \nincluding keeping her at the elementary school, \n\n15 \n \n \nwhere the school day was longer.  Id. at 51a. The \nDistrict rejected all of their proposals.  Id.   \nThroughout this period, Ava\u2019s parents repeatedly \ncomplained to the District that its refusal to provide \nAva \u201ca full day of school equal to her peers was \ndiscriminatory and did not comply with\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  JA484, 440-41.  But despite \nfederal regulatory requirements and a written \nDistrict policy requiring investigation of such \ncomplaints, the District refused to investigate or \nresolve these complaints.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.7; 28 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 35.107; JA80-83, 485. \nInstead, the District claimed credit for supposedly \ngiving Ava an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d to other students, \nbased on its willingness to tolerate Ava\u2019s delayed start \nto the school day and its restraint in not filing a \njuvenile \u201ctruancy action\u201d against her parents.  JA70-\n73, 84. \nC. Procedural History \n1. After years of frustration, Ava\u2019s parents \n\u201c[r]ealiz[ed] that an agreement [with the District] was \nbeyond reach,\u201d so they filed an IDEA complaint with \nthe \nMinnesota \nDepartment \nof \nEducation.  \nPet.App.51a.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held \na five-day hearing and concluded that the District had \nviolated the IDEA by depriving Ava of a FAPE.  See \nJA450-78. \nThe ALJ found that the District\u2019s \u201cproffered \nreasons\u201d for denying her a full school day were \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d and \u201cmore pretextual than real.\u201d  JA468, \n471.  It explained that the District\u2019s \u201cprevailing and \nparamount consideration\u201d had never been Ava\u2019s \u201cneed \nfor instruction,\u201d but rather its own desire \u201cto \n\n16 \n \n \nsafeguard the ordinary end-of-the-workday departure \ntimes for its faculty and staff.\u201d  JA468, 471-72, 475.   \nThe ALJ accordingly ordered the District to \n\u201crevise\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP to include evening instruction and \nother services.  JA476-77.  In so doing, the ALJ \nrejected the District\u2019s proposal of providing a mere \nthree hours of daily instructional time and instead \ndirected the District to provide 5.75 hours, which is \nwhat Ava had received in Kentucky.  JA444, 473-78.  \nThe ALJ also ordered \u201c495 hours of compensatory \neducational instruction,\u201d limiting relief to what the \nALJ believed was the proper two-year \u201climitations \nperiod\u201d under the IDEA.  JA474, 477.6 \n2. The parties then proceeded to federal court.  \nThe District challenged the ALJ\u2019s IDEA ruling.  For \nher part, Ava sued the District under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.   \nAva\u2019s lawsuit under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct sought an injunction that would \u201cpermanently \nsecure [her] rights to a full school day.\u201d  JA21, 24-25; \nsee also JA496.  That injunction would also give her \n\u201cthe opportunity\u201d to participate in non-instructional \nservices \nthat \n\u201ctypical \nkids \nget,\u201d \nsuch \nas \nextracurricular \nactivities, \nwhere \nfeasible \nwith \nreasonable accommodations for her disability.  JA2, \n20-25, 27-28, 318; see also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(4) \n(permitting \nschool \nofficials \nto \nrevise \nIEPs \n\u201cperiodically\u201d).   \n \n6  The District continued to evade its obligations after the \nALJ\u2019s order.  For example, the District \u201cconsistently cancelled \ninstructional sessions,\u201d and its instructors were regularly \u201clate.\u201d  \nJA491.  The District also took six months to comply with the \nALJ\u2019s order to provide eye-gaze technology, Ava\u2019s \u201cmost efficient \nand versatile means of communication.\u201d  JA464, 491. \n\n17 \n \n \nIn \naddition, \nAva \nrequested \n\u201ccompensatory \ndamages\u201d for the entire duration of her mistreatment, \ninvoking the six-year limitations period governing \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought in \nMinnesota.  JA2, 24, 28; see also Gaona v. Town & \nCountry \nCredit, \n324 \nF.3d \n1050, \n1054-56 \n(8th Cir. 2003) (noting absence of express statute of \nlimitations under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nand applying Minnesota\u2019s \u201csix-year limitations period \nfor personal injury actions\u201d); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C) \n(establishing a two-year statute of limitations under \nthe IDEA).  Those damages included expenses that \nwould \u201cnot be fully reimbursed in the IDEA \nproceedings,\u201d such as costs of hiring outside \nspecialists to assist Ava with speech, walking, and \ntoileting.  JA23-24.   \nThe district court upheld Ava\u2019s victory on her \nIDEA claim before the ALJ.  See JA542-95.  The court \nagreed with the ALJ that \u201cthe District\u2019s shifting \nreasons for denying the in-home instruction [Ava] \nseeks to make up for the morning hours she is not in \nschool were never based on [Ava]\u2019s needs.\u201d  JA544.  \nRather, \u201cwhen there was a conflict between [Ava\u2019s] \nneed for instruction and the school\u2019s regular hours, \nthe regular hours of the faculty were always the \nprevailing consideration.\u201d  JA574.  The court \ncriticized the District\u2019s \u201csteadfast[] refusal\u201d to extend \nAva\u2019s school day, noting that \u201c[a]dministrative \nconvenience is not an excuse for impermissibly \nshortening the instructional time a disabled child \nreceives.\u201d  JA574-75. \nThe district court further noted the harm \nassociated with the District\u2019s unwillingness to provide \nAva a full day of instruction.  It emphasized that Ava \nhad \u201clost the capacity\u201d to \u201cuse a variety of signs that \n\n18 \n \n \nshe had used in Kentucky,\u201d to \u201cvoid on the toilet 50% \nof the time,\u201d and to \u201cinteract with peers by using \nassistive technology to initiate or return a greeting.\u201d  \nJA582-83.    \nThe court ultimately held that Ava \u201crequires more \nthan 4.25 hours of schooling a day to have an \neducational program\u201d that \u201cwill allow her to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  JA595.  It thus agreed that \n\u201c[e]xtending [Ava\u2019s] instructional day until 6:00 pm \nand including compensatory hours of instruction\u201d was \n\u201cthe appropriate remedy\u201d under the IDEA.  Id.  \nAs to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, however, \nthe district court granted summary judgment against \nAva and in favor of the District.  The court explained \nthat to prove a violation of those statutes under \nMonahan, Ava had to show that the District had acted \nwith \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.24a-\n25a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171.  Applying \nMonahan\u2019s heightened standard, the district court \nconcluded that the District\u2019s actions \u201cdid not rise to \nth[at] level.\u201d  Pet.App.30a. \n3. In two published opinions by Judge Kobes \nissued \nin \nMarch \n2024, \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nunanimously affirmed both rulings.  See id. at \n49a-57a (IDEA decision); id. at 1a-5a (ADA and \nRehabilitation Act decision). \nIn the IDEA ruling, the Eighth Circuit agreed that \nAva had not received a FAPE based on \u201c[s]everal\u201d \nfacts.  Id. at 54a.  First, Ava had made \u201conly slight \nprogress in a few areas\u201d while in the District\u2019s care.  \nId.  Second, Ava \u201cregressed in toileting\u201d so drastically \nthat the District had \u201cremoved her toileting goal\u201d \naltogether, citing only a \u201clack of time in the short \nday\u2014not [a] lack of ability to improve.\u201d  Id. at \n\n19 \n \n \n55a-56a.  Third, \u201cexpert testimony\u201d confirmed that \nAva \u201cwould have made more progress\u201d with \u201cevening \ninstruction.\u201d  Id. at 56a-57a.  The court also sharply \ncriticized the District, emphasizing that its decisions \nhad \u201c[n]ever been grounded in [Ava]\u2019s individual \nneeds.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  \nDespite ruling for Ava on her IDEA claim, the \nEighth Circuit regretfully rejected her ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Like the district court, the \nEighth Circuit found itself \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan, \nwhich required Ava to establish \u201c\u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019\u201d by the District.  Id. at 3a-4a (quoting \n687 F.2d at 1171).  The court recognized that Ava \n\u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether \nthe \ndistrict \nwas \nnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent.\u201d  Id. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under \nMonahan,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthat\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  Id.  Because her case involved \u201c\u2018educational \nservices for disabled children,\u2019\u201d Ava had to \u201cprove that \nschool officials acted with \u2018either bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Id.  The court held that Ava \u201cha[d] \nfailed to identify conduct clearing Monahan\u2019s bar\u201d\u2014\nand thus could not obtain any relief as a matter of law.  \nId. at 4a-5a.   \nNotably, the Eighth Circuit expressed deep \ndiscomfort with Monahan imposing \u201csuch a high bar \nfor claims based on educational services\u201d brought by \nchildren with disabilities.  Id. at 5a n.2.  The court \nemphasized that \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other \ndisability-discrimination contexts.\u201d  Id.  In every \nother scenario, the court observed, \u201cno intent [is] \nrequired\u201d to establish liability and obtain injunctive \nrelief on a \u201cfailure-to-accommodate claim,\u201d while \n\u201cdamages\u201d \nclaims \nrequire \nonly \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference.\u201d  Id.   \n\n20 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit conceded that Monahan\u2019s \ncarve-out for school-age children with disabilities \nlacks \u201cany anchor in statutory text.\u201d  Id.  Rather, \nMonahan had \u201cspeculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act]\u2019s protections\u201d (and thus the \nADA\u2019s).  Id.  But the court pointed out that \u201cCongress \nrejected [that] premise\u201d in amendments to the EHA \nenacted \u201cjust a few years later.\u201d  Id. (citing \nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub. \nL. No. 99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l))).  Despite those amendments, the Eighth \nCircuit lamented, Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \n\u201cspread like wildfire\u201d across other courts.  Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit concluded that Monahan has \n\u201cbeen questioned\u201d by courts and commentators alike.  \nId.  It declared that the decision stands as \u201ca lesson in \nwhy\u201d courts should not \u201c\u2018add provisions\u2019\u201d to \u201c\u2018federal \nstatute[s]\u2019\u201d that aren\u2019t there.  Id. (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 \nU.S. 330, 352 (2010)).  Nevertheless, the court \nobserved that Monahan \u201cremains the law of [this] \ncircuit\u201d\u2014at least \u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Id. \n4.  In June 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied Ava\u2019s \npetition for rehearing en banc.  Id. at 44a-45a.  Judges \nGrasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented, noting that they \nwould grant the petition.  Id. at 44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a rule \nstating that, unlike all other ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct plaintiffs, children with disabilities seeking relief \nfor education-related discrimination must prove \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d to establish a statutory \n\n21 \n \n \nviolation. Id. at 1170-71.  Monahan is wrong.  The \nADA and Rehabilitation Act require courts to apply \nthe same legal standards to all plaintiffs, including \nchildren with disabilities bringing claims arising in \nthe educational setting.  \nA.  Nothing in the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nremotely suggests that those statutes apply different \nlegal standards to different categories of plaintiffs.  \nThe statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions establish \nuniform, \nacross-the-board \nprotections \nagainst \ndisability discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And their remedial provisions \nstate that \u201cany person\u201d who suffers disability \ndiscrimination may obtain the same relief\u2014without \nexceptions or limitations for school-age children or \nanyone else.  See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133; 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \n \nBy reading the same operative language in the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to establish a different \nstandard in this single factual context, Monahan \nengaged \nin \nnothing \nless \nthan \n\u201cinterpretive \ncontortion.\u201d  United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, \n522 (2008).  This Court has firmly rejected the \n\u201cdangerous principle that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d  \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005).  So the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s plain text forecloses \nMonahan\u2019s bespoke standard uniquely disfavoring \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nvictimized \nby \ndiscrimination at school. \nB.  Monahan adopted its atextual rule because the \nEighth Circuit perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nIDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, so as to \u201cgive each \nof these statutes the full play intended by Congress.\u201d  \n687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That reasoning violates \n\n22 \n \n \nCongress\u2019s later unambiguous command in 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l) that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, \nand remedies available\u201d to children with disabilities \nunder the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and other federal \nlaws.  Construing the IDEA to restrict the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder other statutes is exactly what Section 1415(l) \nforbids. \nC.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s history and \npurposes confirm that Monahan is deeply misguided.  \nCongress enacted these laws to protect \u201call disabled \nindividuals\u201d\u2014equally.  135 Cong. Rec. 19895 (Sept. 7, \n1989) (Statement of Sen. Joe Lieberman) (emphasis \nadded); see, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. 29632 (Sept. 13, \n1973).  And Congress recognized that disability \ndiscrimination is \u201cmost often the product, not of \ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nGiven those legislative goals, it is clear that the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act do not treat school-age \nchildren with disabilities worse than other plaintiffs.  \nAnd the statutes were not meant to condition \nliability\u2014for anyone\u2014on a showing of outright \nanimus or severe misconduct.  Monahan was plainly \nwrong to require children to prove \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to prove disability discrimination, \nparticularly given their special vulnerabilities and \nthe acute risks of lifelong harms in the educational \ncontext. \nD.  Monahan\u2019s rule is unfair and leads to bizarre \nresults.  Its additional barrier to relief senselessly \ndisadvantages vulnerable children like Ava by \nmaking it harder for them to prove ADA and \n\n23 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act claims.  In doing so, Monahan \nundermines incentives for schools to comply with \ntheir statutory obligations in the first place.  And \ndespite \nseverely \ndisadvantaging \nprimary \nand \nsecondary \nstudents \nin \nthis \nway, \nMonahan \ninexplicably excuses from its heightened standard \ncollege students bringing education-related claims for \ndisability discrimination.  That disparate treatment \nmakes no sense. \nE.  At its core, Monahan\u2019s asymmetric standard is \nbased on flawed policy, not law.  Monahan purported \nto seek \u201ca proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  687 F.2d at \n1171.  But Congress itself struck that proper balance \nby granting broad relief to all plaintiffs under the \nuniform standards set forth in the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  In any event, Monahan\u2019s policy \nconcerns are themselves misguided:  There is no \nsound basis for singling out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under those \nstatutes.   \nARGUMENT \nMONAHAN\u2019S ATEXTUAL AND ASYMMETRIC \nRULE SHOULD BE REJECTED \nForty-three years ago, in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit \noffered this \u201cguidance\u201d to lower courts:  Before a \nRehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in \u201cthe \ncontext of education of handicapped children,\u201d the \nplaintiff must show that the defendant acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  \nMonahan is wrong.  Courts must apply the same legal \n\n24 \n \n \nstandards to all claims brought under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, regardless of who the plaintiff is \nor how her claims arose. \nA. The Statutory Text Establishes Uniform \nRules Governing All Claims  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision below correctly \nrecognized that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act is \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive prohibitions and \nremedial provisions offer \u201cno indication that Congress \nintended\u201d for the legal standard a plaintiff must \nsatisfy \u201cto turn on the type of [claim] being [brought].\u201d  \nAli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 220-21 \n(2008).  Rather, they establish uniform standards \nthat courts must apply even-handedly\u2014to everyone.  \nSo the baseline rules that govern in all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases must govern claims brought \nby \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nchallenging \ndiscrimination at school. \n1.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive \nprohibitions create a single standard governing all \nclaims brought under each statute.  Section 202 of the \nADA provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act establishes a materially identical \nprohibition for recipients of federal funding.  See 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nThese expansive prohibitions forbid not just \nactions motivated by \u201cinvidious animus\u201d or other \n\n25 \n \n \negregious misconduct toward people with disabilities, \nbut \nalso \nconduct \nstemming \nfrom \nmere \n\u201cthoughtlessness and indifference\u201d toward their \nunique needs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985) \n(addressing \nRehabilitation \nAct). \n \nThe \nprovisions \naccordingly \nrequire \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations\u201d in order \u201cto assure meaningful \naccess\u201d to public or federally funded services, \nprograms, and activities to which \u201cotherwise qualified \nhandicapped individuals\u201d are \u201centitled.\u201d  Id. at 301.  \nFailure to provide such accommodations violates both \nstatutes.  See Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. \n154, 170 (2017); supra at 7.  And contrary to \nMonahan, nothing in either law remotely suggests \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d must be \nshown\u2014by anyone\u2014before a statutory \u201cviolation\u201d can \nbe \u201cmade out.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  \nThe text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprohibitions gives no hint that education-related \nclaims brought by children with disabilities should be \ntreated differently from all other claims seeking relief \nunder the same operative provision.  And this Court \nhas firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle that \njudges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  The \u201csame word[s]\u201d in the \u201csame \nstatutory provisions\u201d must have the same meaning, \neven \u201cin different factual contexts.\u201d  United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (emphasis omitted). \nBy reading the same operative language to \nestablish \na \ndifferent \nstandard \nin \njust \none \ncircumstance, Monahan engaged in nothing less than \n\u201cinterpretive contortion.\u201d  Id.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act are not \u201cchameleon[s].\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Clark, 543 U.S at 382).  Their meaning \n\n26 \n \n \n\u201ccannot change\u201d whenever a child with disabilities \nalleges discrimination at the hands of school officials.  \nId.  Accordingly, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nacross-the-board prohibitions apply equally in all \ncases seeking relief under these statutes, no matter a \nplaintiff\u2019s age, the nature of her disability, or whether \nshe suffered discrimination in a school setting. \n2.  The statutes\u2019 remedial provisions reinforce that \nall plaintiffs must be treated equally.  Section 203 of \nthe ADA states that \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and \nrights set forth in\u201d the Rehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the \nremedies, procedures, and rights\u201d that the ADA \n\u201cprovides to any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133 (emphasis added).  And Section 505 of the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in \n[T]itle VI\u201d are \u201cavailable to any person aggrieved\u201d by \ndisability discrimination under the Rehabilitation \nAct.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added).  \n\u201cAny person\u201d means just that\u2014any person.  This \nlanguage requires equal treatment of all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  It leaves no room for \nexceptions or special rules making it more difficult for \ncertain classes of plaintiffs to prove their claims.  \n\u201cWhen used (as here) with a \u2018singular noun in \naffirmative contexts,\u2019 the word \u2018any\u2019 ordinarily \n\u2018refer[s] to a member of a particular group or class \nwithout distinction or limitation\u2019 and in this way \n\u2018impl[ies] every member of the class or group.\u2019\u201d  SAS \nInst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 363 (2018) \n(alterations in original) (quoting Oxford English \nDictionary (3d ed. 2016)).   \nMonahan thus had no textual basis \u201cto restrict the \nunqualified language\u201d of the ADA and Rehabilitation \n\n27 \n \n \nAct\u2019s remedial provisions by making it more difficult \nfor children with disabilities to prove discrimination \nin the educational context.  Brogan v. United States, \n522 U.S. 398, 403 (1998); accord Pet.App.5a n.2; Mark \nC. Weber, Accidently on Purpose: Intent in Disability \nDiscrimination Law, 56 B.C. L. Rev. 1417, 1455-61 \n(2015); Thomas Simmons, The ADA Prima Facie \nPlaintiff: A Critical Overview of Eighth Circuit Case \nLaw, 47 Drake L. Rev. 761, 822-23 & nn.370-71 \n(1999).  Like the statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions, \nthe remedial provisions expressly incorporating \nTitle VI\u2019s rights and remedies apply equally to victims \nof disability discrimination \u201cof whatever kind.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997).   \nAs for Title VI itself, that landmark civil-rights \nlaw likewise demands evenhanded enforcement.  \nTitle VI provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United \nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  This Court\u2019s \n\u201cprior decisions have found an implied right of action\u201d \nfor anyone who suffers such discrimination under \nTitle VI, which \u201cCongress has acknowledged\u201d in \nsubsequent \u201camendments to the statute.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). \nTitle \nVI\u2019s \nacross-the-board \nban \non \nracial \ndiscrimination supplies no basis for imposing a \nuniquely stringent standard on any class of plaintiffs, \nlet alone school-age children.  And no Title VI case has \never adopted a Monahan-like \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d rule for establishing a statutory \nviolation or obtaining any form of relief in the school \nsetting.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n\n28 \n \n \n279-80 (2001) (noting that \u201cboth injunctive relief and \ndamages\u201d are available under Title VI).  It follows \nthat courts \u201ccannot curate\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims and treat some differently from others.  \nSAS Inst., 584 U.S. at 359-60.  Rather, courts \u201cmust \ndecide them all\u201d under the same legal standards.  Id.   \n3.  This is not the only case this Term where the \nCourt will address whether to impose a more \nstringent\u2014and non-textual\u2014legal standard on only a \nsubset of anti-discrimination plaintiffs under the \nsame statute.  In Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth \nServices, No. 23-1039, the Sixth Circuit held that \nTitle VII plaintiffs who are members of a majority \ngroup\u2014but not members of minority groups\u2014must \nsatisfy not only \u201cthe usual [requirements] for \nestablishing a prima-facie case\u201d of discrimination, but \nalso \nan \nadditional \nrequirement \nof \nshowing \n\u201c\u2018background circumstances to support the suspicion \nthat the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u2019\u201d  Ames v. Ohio \nDep\u2019t of Youth Servs., 87 F.4th 822, 825 (6th Cir. \n2023).  This Court granted certiorari to decide \nwhether that extra requirement is correct.   \nNotably, \nthe \nAmes \nrespondent \nhas \nnow \nabandoned the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule and conceded that \n\u201cthe same legal standard applies to all Title VII \nplaintiffs,\u201d  Ames Resp. Br. 1, and that \u201cit is wrong to \nhold some litigants to a higher standard\u201d than others,  \nAmes Oral Argument Tr. 39.  Both parties in Ames, \nalong with the United States, are thus \u201cin radical \nagreement\u201d that Title VII \u201capplies the same to \neverybody,\u201d no matter who they are or the nature of \ntheir discrimination claim.  Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 39; \nAmes U.S. Amicus Br. 11-31.  This Court seems \nsimilarly inclined.  See Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 43-45, \n\n29 \n \n \n49-51, 54-56, 58-60.  The same even-handed approach \nshould govern the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, too. \n4.  Neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act \nexpressly sets forth an intent requirement for proving \na statutory violation or for obtaining particular kinds \nof relief.  And while this Court has not squarely \naddressed the issue, the lower courts generally agree \non the baseline standards governing ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.   \nOutside the educational context, the courts of \nappeals uniformly hold that plaintiffs can show a \nviolation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2014and by \nextension, establish eligibility for injunctive relief\u2014if \nthey prove that the defendant failed to provide a \nreasonable accommodation to a covered person with a \ndisability.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1.  No showing of \nwrongful intent is required.  Id.   \nFor damages, though, virtually all courts have \nheld that plaintiffs outside the educational setting \nmust prove a form of wrongful intent, consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s case interpreting Title VI.  Supra at 9; \nsee also Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 282-83 (requiring \nwrongful intent for damages claims under Title VI).  \nThe overwhelming majority have held that plaintiffs \nmay satisfy this intent requirement by proving that \nthe defendant acted with deliberate indifference\u2014i.e., \nignored a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that its conduct would \n\u201cresult in a violation of federally protected rights.\u201d  \nMeagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 \n(8th Cir. 2011); see also supra at 10 & n.2; Gebser v. \nLago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998) \n(holding that deliberate indifference is sufficient to \nshow such intent under Title IX, which was likewise \n\u201cmodeled after Title VI\u201d); Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185-89 \n(looking to Title IX precedent in determining the \n\n30 \n \n \nscope of private damages remedies available under \nthe ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Title VI). \n \nFor the reasons explained above, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nsubject \nall \ndiscrimination \nplaintiffs to the same legal standards.  As the United \nStates has noted, \u201cwhere courts have interpreted\u201d the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cto require proof of \ncertain elements for claims outside of the school \ncontext, they must do the same with claims in the \nschool context.\u201d  Suppl.Br.Add.11a (filed Oct. 7, 2024).  \nSo whichever baseline legal standards apply under \nthese statutes in other contexts must apply in this one \ntoo.  There is no textual basis for disfavoring children \nwith \ndisabilities \nwho \nsuffer \neducation-related \ndiscrimination.7 \nB. Monahan Violates Section 1415(l) \n \nMonahan justified its atextual rule primarily by \n\u201cspeculat[ing] that Congress intended the IDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d \nstatute\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s] protections.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \nTwo years later, Congress refuted that reasoning by \nproviding that \u201c[n]othing\u201d in the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or \nlimit[s]\u201d relief available under the ADA and \n \n7  Ava\u2019s question presented focuses only on whether \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related claims \nshould be subject to a heightened, context-specific standard for \nproving violations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Supra \nat i.  It does not ask the Court to decide what standard should \nuniformly govern all claims.  That said, the courts of appeals are \nclearly correct that intentional discrimination is not required to \nestablish a violation of either statute, especially when the claim \nalleges that the defendant failed to provide a reasonable \naccommodation.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1. \n\n31 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  Monahan \ndirectly violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s command.   \n1.  Monahan perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nEHA (now the IDEA) and Rehabilitation Act and \nprevent the latter from becoming a cause of action \u201cfor \neducational malpractice\u201d that would supplant the \nEHA.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  In other words, Monahan \nconstrued the EHA as an implicit constraint on \nRehabilitation Act claims brought in the school \nsetting\u2014one limiting liability and restricting relief to \nrare cases where children with disabilities can prove \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d by school officials.  \nId.  According to Monahan, this step was needed to \n\u201cgive each of these statutes the full play intended by \nCongress.\u201d  Id. at 1171.   \nTwo years after Monahan was decided, this Court \nembraced a version of Monahan\u2019s logic.  In Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Court held that the \nEHA provided the \u201cexclusive avenue\u201d for children \nwith disabilities to bring discrimination claims \nrelated to their education.  Id. at 1009 (emphasis \nadded).  The Court reasoned that the EHA establishes \n\u201ca comprehensive scheme\u201d that focused directly on \n\u201cpublic education for handicapped children.\u201d  Id.  \nBecause \nthat \nscheme \ngives \n\u201clocal \nand \nstate \neducational agencies the primary responsibility for \ndeveloping a plan to accommodate the needs of each \nindividual handicapped child,\u201d the Court found it \n\u201cdifficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave \nundisturbed the ability of a handicapped child\u201d to \nassert other \u201cvirtually identical\u201d causes of action.  Id. \nat 1009, 1011.  Smith thus decreed that the EHA did \nnot just limit Rehabilitation Act relief for school-age \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \n(as \nMonahan \nhad \n\n32 \n \n \nconcluded), but fully displaced that statute in the \nschool setting. \nCongress swiftly repudiated Smith\u2019s reasoning\u2014\nand with it, Monahan\u2019s as well.  In 1986, Congress \namended the EHA (now the IDEA) to \u201c\u2018reaffirm[] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA [and \nRehabilitation Act] \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less \nintegral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of \nhandicapped children.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 4, 6 (1985)); see also S. Rep. \nNo. 99-112, at 2 (1985).  Now codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l), this IDEA amendment provides in relevant \npart: \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); see also Handicapped Children\u2019s \nProtection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-372, \u00a7 3, 100 \nStat. 796, 797 (HCPA).   \nCongress thus expressly established a rule of \nconstruction under which the IDEA cannot be \ninterpreted to \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the ability of children \nwith disabilities to obtain relief under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act.  Id.  In doing so, Congress made \nclear that while these various statutes \u201coverlap\u201d in \nsome respects, they are different in important ways \nand retain full independent force.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 171.  \u201cThe IDEA offers federal funds to States in \nexchange for a commitment: to furnish a \u2018free \nappropriate public education\u2019\u201d to \u201call children with \n\n33 \n \n \ncertain physical or intellectual disabilities.\u201d  Id. at \n158.  By contrast, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \neach \nguarantee \n\u201cnon-discriminatory \naccess \nto\u201d \neducational services for children with disabilities, as \ncompared to their non-disabled peers.  Id. at 170-71.  \nSection 1415(l) establishes that the latter guarantee \ncoexists with, and cannot be subordinated to, the \nformer. \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s drafters repeatedly emphasized \nwhat the text makes clear.  One HCPA co-sponsor, for \nexample, declared that the IDEA was never \u201cintended \nto \nin \nany \nway \nlimit \nhandicapped \nchildren\u2019s \neducational rights or the remedies for protecting \nthose rights.\u201d  131 Cong. Rec. 21391 (July 30, 1985) \n(statement of Sen. Ted Kennedy) (emphasis added).  \nAnother explained that Section 1415(l) commands \nthat the IDEA must be interpreted to \u201cenhance\u201d the \nremedies available to children with disabilities \n\u201cunder other laws\u201d\u2014not to \u201climit[]\u201d or \u201creplace\u201d them.  \nId. at 21392 (statement of Sen. Paul Simon).  And the \nreport from the House Committee on Education and \nLabor reiterated that the IDEA may not \u201cbe construed \nto modify traditional standards used by the courts for \ndetermining\u201d when relief \u201cis appropriate\u201d under the \nRehabilitation Act and other federal laws (such as the \nlater-enacted ADA).  H.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 7.  \nThese sources confirm the statutory text\u2019s plain \nmeaning. \n2.  Monahan violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s directive.  \nMonahan held that the IDEA (formerly the EHA) \nrequires interpreting the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nto require children with disabilities to show bad faith \nor gross misjudgment to prevail on education-related \ndiscrimination claims.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That is, \nMonahan interpreted the IDEA to \u201crestrict\u201d and \n\n34 \n \n \n\u201climit\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d available to \nchildren like Ava under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct by requiring them to satisfy a more stringent \nstandard than anyone else suing under these \nstatutes.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  That is precisely what \nSection 1415(l) forbids.  See Howell ex rel. Howell v. \nWaterford Pub. Schs., 731 F. Supp. 1314, 1318 (E.D. \nMich. 1990) (criticizing Monahan for violating Section \n1415(l)). \nThe \nDistrict \nresisted \nthis \nstraightforward \nconclusion in its brief opposing certiorari.  There, the \nDistrict asserted that Section 1415(l) \u201coverruled \nSmith\u201d\u2014\u201cnot Monahan\u201d\u2014and did not \u201copine on the \nstandard governing\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims.  BIO31.  That misses the point.  Congress \nundoubtedly sought to reject Smith, but Smith and \nMonahan both adopted the same flawed view that the \nIDEA implicitly restricts the scope of other federal \nanti-discrimination statutes, as applied to children \nwith disabilities suffering from discrimination in the \neducational context.   \nWhatever particular precedent Congress had in \nmind, Section 1415(l)\u2019s text flatly prohibits Monahan\u2019s \nconstruction of the IDEA to limit relief available \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  So even \nthough Section 1415(l) does not set forth legal \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims, it still squarely \u201creject[s] Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d \nthat the IDEA requires a uniquely stringent standard \nfor ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, as the Eighth \nCircuit recognized in its decision below.  Pet.App.5a \nn.2.  Section 1415(l) leaves no doubt that Monahan\u2019s \natextual and asymmetric rule is wrong. \n\n35 \n \n \nC. Monahan Undermines The Core Goals Of \nThe ADA And Rehabilitation Act \nMonahan\u2019s judicially invented rule requiring only \nschool-age children with disabilities to prove bad faith \nor gross misjudgment violates the central purpose of \nboth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Congress \nenacted those statutes to protect all Americans living \nwith disabilities from discrimination.  Nothing \nsuggests that Congress wanted to diminish the extent \nof that protection for anyone with a disability\u2014let \nalone for school-age children, who are perhaps the \nmost vulnerable subset of such people.  And because \nboth statutes were designed to remedy passive \nneglect, it is clear Congress did not intend to limit \nrelief solely to cases involving outright animus or \negregious misconduct for any class of plaintiffs. \n1.  The goal of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nwas, as Senator Ted Kennedy explained, \u201cnothing less \nthan to give every disabled American a fair share of \nthe American Dream.\u201d  Americans With Disabilities \nAct of 1989: Hearing on S. 933 Before the Subcomm. \non the Handicapped of the S. Comm. On Labor & \nHum. Res., 101st Cong. 223 (1989) (emphasis added) \n(discussing ADA).  The legislative history of both \nstatutes confirms Congress\u2019s desire to promote equal \ntreatment of all Americans with disabilities, across \nthe board. \nFor example, in enacting the Rehabilitation Act, \nSenator Alan Cranston described Congress\u2019s goal as \nprotecting all of the \u201c9.8 million handicapped persons\u201d \nthen living in the United States.  119 Cong. Rec. at \n29631-32; see also S. Rep. No. 93-391, at 45 (1973) \n(observing that the statute prohibits the denial of \nservices to \u201cany handicapped individual\u201d based on the \nindividual\u2019s disability).  And later, when Congress \n\n36 \n \n \namended the Act to codify a private right of action, \nSenator Cranston emphasized that the statute was \nmeant to \u201cto remedy violations of [S]ection 504\u2014with \nno exception.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. S15104 (Oct. 3, 1986) \n(emphasis added).  Other legislators reiterated that, \n\u201c[s]ince initial passage of this law, Congress has\u201d \nsought to protect \u201cthe quality of life for all \nhandicapped persons.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. 28090 (Oct. 2, \n1986) (statement of Representative Mario Biaggi, \nco-sponsor of 1986 amendments) (emphasis added); \nsee also 131 Cong. Rec. at 21391 (statement of Sen. \nJohn Kerry, another co-sponsor) (similar). \nSo too for the ADA.  Representative Tony Coelho\u2014\nwho sponsored the legislation and, like Ava, suffers \nfrom epilepsy\u2014observed that the statute would also \nprotect \n\u201c[e]very \nAmerican,\u201d \nwithout \nexception.  \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1988: Joint \nHearing on S. 2345 Before the Subcomm. on the \nHandicapped of the S. Comm. on Labor & Hum. \nResources & the Subcomm. on Select Educ. of the H. \nComm. on Educ. & Labor, 100th Cong. 938 (1988).  \nHis colleagues agreed that the ADA was meant to \n\u201cbring equality to the lives of all Americans with \ndisabilities.\u201d  136 Cong. Rec. 17376 (July 13, 1990) \n(statement of Senator Bob Dole, an ADA sponsor) \n(emphasis added); see, e.g., 135 Cong. Rec. 19895 \n(Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Senator Warren \nRudman, another ADA sponsor, observing that the \nADA\u2019s \nprotections \n\u201cextend \nto \nall \ndisabled \nindividuals\u201d).   \n \nGiven these statements, it boggles the mind to \nthink that Congress wanted these important \nanti-discrimination statutes to disfavor certain \nclasses of plaintiffs with disabilities by requiring \nthem to satisfy a more stringent test than anyone \n\n37 \n \n \nelse.  Children with disabilities are among the most \nvulnerable members of our society.  Too often, they \nare \u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d while at \nschool.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (quoting 117 Cong. \nRec. 45974 (Dec. 9, 1971)).  Such discrimination in the \neducational context can inflict severe, life-altering \nharm.  See, e.g., Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. \n142, 145 (2023) (school district denied deaf student a \nqualified \naide \nfor \ntwelve \nyears, \ndrastically \ndiminishing his ability to communicate with others \nand earn a living). \n \nWhen such discrimination happens, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \ncrucial \nmeans \nof \n\u201cprotecting [victims\u2019] interests,\u201d just as those statutes \nassist other plaintiffs facing disability discrimination \nin other contexts.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 159.  There is no \nreason to think that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nsaddle children with disabilities\u2014and nobody else\u2014\nwith \u201can impossibly high bar\u201d for proving a statutory \nviolation.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023); see also Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act were meant to ensure equality, \nand their guarantees apply equally. \n \n2.  Even clearer is that Congress never wanted \ncourts to impose an intent requirement for liability on \nanyone suing under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \nespecially for failure to accommodate a disability.   \n \n\u201cDiscrimination against the handicapped was \nperceived by Congress to be most often the product, \nnot of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness \nand indifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 295.  Congress thus enacted the Rehabilitation \nAct to remedy \u201cshameful oversights\u201d and \u201cthe \ninvisibility of the handicapped in America.\u201d  Id. \nat 295-96 (first quoting 117 Cong. Rec. 45974 \n\n38 \n \n \n(Dec. 9, 1971); and then quoting, 118 Cong. Rec. \n525-26 (Jan. 20, 1972)).  The ADA was likewise \nenacted \nto \naddress \nhow \n\u201csociety \nhas \nbeen \ninadvertently structured in a way that unnecessarily \ndenies innumerable opportunities, great and small, to \npeople with disabilities.\u201d  Joint Hearing on S. 2345, \n100th Cong. at 941 (emphasis added).  The central \ngoal of these statutes, in other words, was to guard \nagainst \u201capathetic attitudes\u201d toward people with \ndisabilities.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 296.   \n \nMonahan\u2019s directive that a Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in the educational context \nonly by showing bad faith or gross misjudgment, 687 \nF.2d at 1171\u2014rather than mere \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as \nrequired from all other plaintiffs, Choate, 469 U.S. at \n295\u2014defies that objective.  With Congress so \nunmistakably focused on the widespread passive \nneglect of people with disabilities, it is inconceivable \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act excuse liability \nin any category of cases, just because the alleged \ndisability discrimination falls short of outright \nanimus or especially severe mistreatment.  So by \ngiving a free pass to actions driven by educational \nofficials\u2019 \u201capathetic attitudes,\u201d Monahan immunized \n\u201cmuch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in \npassing the Rehabilitation Act,\u201d as well as the ADA.  \nId. at 296-97.  Monahan is at odds with the core \npurpose of both statutes. \nD. Monahan \nIs \nUnfair \nAnd \nLeads \nTo \nArbitrary Results \nMonahan singles out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.  Beside openly defying the \nstatutory \ntext \nand \npurpose, \nthis \nasymmetric \n\n39 \n \n \ntreatment is fundamentally unfair and leads to \nbizarre results. \n1.  Whereas Monahan establishes an exceedingly \n\u201chigh bar for claims based on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, courts \u201crequire \nmuch \nless \nin \nother \ndisability-discrimination \ncontexts.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  That disparity matters, as \nthis case illustrates.   \nIt is hard enough for parents to muster the \nresources needed to fight for their child\u2019s federally \nprotected rights while simultaneously trying to \nremediate life-altering educational gaps in the \nmeantime.  Yet Monahan\u2019s heightened standard lets \nschool districts off the hook even when they act with \ndeliberate \nindifference \nto \nstudents\u2019 \nfederally \nprotected rights.  That additional barrier makes it \nexceedingly difficult for children with disabilities to \nobtain much-needed relief under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  It also blunts incentives for \nschools to fulfill their statutory responsibilities in the \nfirst place. \nHere, for example, Ava\u2019s parents spent years \nfighting for the District to give her the same \nreasonable accommodations that her prior school \ndistrict in Kentucky had provided without issue.  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  But over and over again, the \nDistrict refused, offering a series of \u201cshifting,\u201d \n\u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot credible\u201d explanations that had \nnothing to do with Ava\u2019s \u201cindividual needs.\u201d  Id. at \n50a, 57a; JA468, 471, 544; supra at 14-16.  Indeed, the \nDistrict\u2019s own Director of Student Services appeared \nunaware of the District\u2019s obligations under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act:  She repeatedly insisted\u2014\nincorrectly\u2014that providing a FAPE under the IDEA \nsatisfied the District\u2019s non-discrimination obligations \n\n40 \n \n \nunder these other statutes.  JA190 (rejecting notion \nthat \u201ca school district [can] provide a FAPE under \nIDEA and still discriminate on the basis of \ndisability\u201d); see also JA191-96, 208-09, 216-18, 240. \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit acknowledged the \nconsiderable evidence showing that the District had \nbeen \u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \ndenying \nthe \nreasonable \naccommodations \nshe \ndesperately needed.  Pet.App.3a.  The court also \npointedly criticized the District\u2019s deliberate \u201cchoice to \nprioritize its administrative concerns\u201d over Ava\u2019s \n\u201cindividual needs,\u201d while giving \u201ca series of shifting \nexplanations\u201d for failing to meet them.  Id. at 57a; see \nCA8 Appellant\u2019s Br.4-17, 50-55.  All this should have \nbeen more than sufficient for Ava to survive summary \njudgment and obtain both injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan, \n[i]t\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n2.  Ava\u2019s experience is all too common.  A Westlaw \nsearch reveals hundreds of district court decisions \napplying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases, with \nthe overwhelming majority denying relief.8  Many \n \n8  See, e.g., Parnes v.

The school also failed to \nprovide \nsuitable \n\u201cdesks\u201d \nand \n\u201can \naccessible \nbathroom,\u201d while failing to fix \u201cdangerous\u201d walkways \nto various facilities, despite the child falling multiple \ntimes.  Id. at 778.  There too, the court rejected the \nstudent\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims under \nMonahan, reasoning that \u201c[a]lthough mistakes may \nhave been made, they d[id] not rise to the level of bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 784.   \nThese cases confirm that the \u201cadditional element\u201d \nimposed by Monahan is \u201cimpossibl[e]\u201d to satisfy \u201cfor \nmany plaintiffs.\u201d  Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002.  Congress \n\n43 \n \n \ndid not enact that unduly harsh regime, which \nsenselessly disadvantages some of society\u2019s most \nvulnerable members.   \n3.  Monahan\u2019s asymmetric rule also leads to \narbitrary and anomalous results.   It requires pre-K, \nelementary, middle, and high school students suing \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to prove bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. \nRosemount- Apple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d \n966, 968, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017).  But college students \nbringing the exact same claims do not have to clear \nthat hurdle, even in circuits that apply Monahan\u2019s \nheightened standard.  See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake \nForest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461-62 \n(4th Cir. 2012); Mershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d \n1069, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2006); Gati v. W. Kentucky \nUniv., 762 F. App\u2019x 246, 250 (6th Cir. 2019).  Why \nshould a graduation ceremony drastically alter the \nstandard for demonstrating disability discrimination \nin the educational context?  Monahan doesn\u2019t say.   \nThe District asserts that this head-scratching \nregime was actually part of Congress\u2019s design because \n\u201ccollege students,\u201d unlike \u201celementary and secondary \nstudents, \u201care not covered by the IDEA.\u201d  BIO31 n.3.  \nBut again, Congress has made clear\u2014in unequivocal \nstatutory text\u2014that potential overlap with the IDEA \ndoes not \u201crestrict\u201d or \u201climit\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s protections.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); \nsee supra at 30-34.  Plus, courts apply Monahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard even in \ncases where school-age children with disabilities are \nbringing claims that do not involve the denial of a \nFAPE\u2014and thus lack any nexus with the IDEA.  \nSee, e.g., Baker v. Bentonville Sch. Dist., 75 F.4th 810, \n815-16 (8th Cir. 2023) (safety hazards at school for \n\n44 \n \n \nvisually impaired child); Hoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 283, 103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th \nCir. 1996) (elevator access at school for physically \nimpaired child).   \nRequiring school-age children with disabilities \nwho suffer education-related discrimination to satisfy \na more stringent standard than college students who \nendured the same mistreatment makes no sense.  Yet \nthat unsound result flows directly from Monahan. \nE. Monahan \nRested \nOn \nFlawed \nPolicy \nAnalysis, Not Law \nAt its core, Monahan is a textbook example of \nlegislating from the bench.  The Eighth Circuit \nadmitted that it sought to achieve \u201cwhat we\u201d\u2014judges, \nnot legislators\u2014\u201cbelieve to be a proper balance \nbetween the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171 (emphasis added).   \nMonahan was wrong to \u201creplace the actual text\u201d of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act with judicial \n\u201cspeculation as to Congress\u2019 intent\u201d on matters of \npolicy.  Perez, 598 U.S. at 150.  It was especially wrong \nto do so in a case where the parties\u2019 briefs did not \naddress the proper standard for Rehabilitation Act \nclaims in the school setting\u2014let alone propose a \nbrand new \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d test.9  \nAnd even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s speculation \nabout Congress\u2019s intent makes little sense. \n \n9  The Monahan briefs are available at the National \nArchives in Kansas City, and can be provided to the Court by \nAva\u2019s counsel upon request.  \n\n45 \n \n \n1.  Judges ordinarily do not claim broad authority \nto invent bespoke legal standards for federal statutes \nbased on pure policy grounds.  In Monahan, the \nEighth Circuit offered no persuasive basis for \nclaiming that policymaking authority.      \nThe District has now tried to fill in the gap.  In its \nbrief opposing certiorari, the District argued that \nbecause the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s private \nrights of action are \u201cjudicially implied,\u201d courts have \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial \nscheme.\u201d  BIO26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  \nThis post hoc defense of Monahan\u2019s self-described \npolicymaking does not withstand scrutiny. \nFor starters, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprivate rights of action are not implied.  Rather, the \nstatutes \u201cexpressly incorporate[]\u201d the preexisting \nright of action under Title VI, which was originally \njudicially implied and later congressionally ratified.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 \nU.S.C \u00a7 12133.  So whatever \u201cmeasure of latitude\u201d \ncourts might have to tinker with an implied private \nright of action is irrelevant.  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284. \nRegardless, any such latitude is sharply limited.  \nCourts can only shape an implied right of action in the \nway that \u201cbest comports with the statute.\u201d  Id.  But \nhere, as explained, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \n\u201cgeneral language\u201d served to \u201cproduce general \ncoverage\u201d for all people with disabilities\u2014and does \nnot \u201cleave room for courts to recognize ad hoc \nexceptions\u201d for school-age children or anyone else.  \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 101 (2012); see supra \nat 24-30.  Indeed, the District has not mustered a \nsingle decision from this Court authorizing disfavored \n\n46 \n \n \ntreatment of different classes of plaintiffs asserting \nthe same private right of action, implied or otherwise.  \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial overreaching\u201d is clear as day.  \nDrew Millar, Judicially Reducing the Standard of \nCare: \nAn \nAnalysis \nof \nthe \nBad \nFaith/Gross \nMisjudgment \nStandard \nin \nSpecial \nEducation \nDiscrimination, 96 Ky. L.J. 711, 728-29 (2008). \n \n2.  Even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s atextual \nappeal to policy does not hold up.  Monahan doubted \n\u201cthe competence of courts to make judgments\u201d about \ndecisions by \u201ceducational officials\u201d in this \u201ctechnical \nfield[].\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  But the IDEA demands \ninquiry into the \u201cadequacy of a given\u201d child\u2019s \neducation\u2014and thus judicial examination of the \n\u201cdecisions\u201d made by educational officials, with \nappropriate respect for the \u201cexpertise and the exercise \nof judgment by school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel.  \nJoseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386, 404 (2017).  Such respectful consideration of \nschools\u2019 decisionmaking is equally proper under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nMore fundamentally, just last Term this Court \nresoundingly rejected the notion, echoed in Monahan, \nthat some matters are simply too \u201ctechnical\u201d for \ncourts to review independently.  Loper Bright Enters. \nv. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 402 (2024).  Federal courts \nare surely capable of showing due respect for \neducational officials\u2019 experience and expertise while \nadjudicating discrimination claims in the school \nsetting\u2014just as they do in any other context.  It is a \nmistake to distort statutory text out of a misplaced \nfear that courts cannot responsibly decide cases \n\n47 \n \n \nimplicating sensitive or technical matters.  The ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act are no exception.10 \n3.  Rather than focus on policy, this Court should \napply the law.  In recent years, the Court has \nrepeatedly enforced the plain text of federal \ncivil-rights \nstatutes \nprotecting \nvulnerable \npopulations\u2014including children with disabilities\u2014\nfrom discrimination.  See, e.g., Perez, 598 U.S. at \n146-47; Fry, 580 U.S. at 158; Endrew F., 580 U.S. at \n399; see also Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. \n346, 355 (2024); Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468-70 \n(2023); Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 402 (2020); \nMount Lemmon Fire Dist. v. Guido, 586 U.S. 1, 6-8 \n(2018).  These decisions vindicate textualism as a \nmethod of statutory interpretation that is \u201cneutral as \na matter of politics and policy.\u201d  Brett M. Kavanaugh, \nFixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. \n2118, 2135 (2016).   \n \nThis Court should embrace that same textualist \napproach here.  Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard flunks every test of text, \nhistory, purpose, and policy.  This Court should now \nfix Monahan\u2019s error.  It should enforce the plain \nmeaning of the Nation\u2019s anti-discrimination laws and \nrestore the full protections Congress granted children \nwith disabilities. \n \n10  It would likewise be mistaken to distort the statutory \ntext out of fear that plaintiffs might try to \u201cend-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school districts\u2019 \nfacilitation of the IDEA.\u201d  BIO28.  The IDEA already addresses \npotential evasion:  It \u201cdemand[s]\u201d exhaustion of the IEP process \n\u201cwhen a plaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA can supply,\u201d like a \nFAPE-related injunction\u2014while \u201cexcusing exhaustion when a \nplaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA cannot provide,\u201d like damages.  \nPerez, 598 U.S. at 150. \n\n48 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be vacated \nand the case remanded for further proceedings. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nNICHOLAS ROSELLINI \nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP \n505 Montgomery Street \nSuite 2000 \nSan Francisco, CA 94111 \n \nAMY J.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about this case remain stable following this observation, as it was an internal reasoning step rather than the introduction of new external evidence. The observation serves to confirm and crystallize the significant shift in my understanding that occurred after analyzing the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO). My current belief state is defined by the tension between the Petitioner's initial claims and the Respondent's powerful rebuttal, and I am now awaiting the final piece of pre-certiorari briefing to resolve this tension.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **The Central Legal Question is Now a Contested Battleground:** The case is no longer a straightforward question of whether the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is valid. It is now a strategic battle over framing.\n    *   **Petitioner's Frame:** The ADA/Rehab Act should not have a heightened, judicially-created intent standard for educational discrimination claims, and the existing 5-2 circuit split on this issue needs resolution.\n    *   **Respondent's Frame:** This case is about a failure to prove \"discriminatory intent,\" a standard requirement. The \"bad faith\" language is merely a formulation used in the specific context where the IDEA and ADA overlap, designed to prevent the ADA from becoming a tool to second-guess educational decisions that are the proper subject of the IDEA. This reframing, advanced by top-tier counsel Lisa Blatt, is a significant strategic maneuver.\n\n2.  **The Circuit Split's Existence is in Doubt:** My initial belief in a clear 5-2 split has been effectively undermined by the BIO. The respondent argues persuasively that the split is illusory.\n    *   **Substantive Agreement:** The respondent contends that even circuits using different language (\"deliberate indifference\" vs. \"bad faith\") substantively require a high level of intent that goes beyond mere negligence or incorrect educational placement.\n    *   **Context is Key:** The respondent distinguishes cases cited by the petitioner, arguing they either don't involve challenges to the substance of an educational program (like an IEP or 504 plan) or are otherwise factually distinct.\n    *   **My Current Stance:** I am now highly uncertain about the cert-worthiness of the split. The Court may see it as a semantic disagreement rather than a deep, substantive conflict in the law, giving them a strong reason to deny review. The petitioner's reply brief is now critical; it *must* convincingly rehabilitate the argument that a genuine, outcome-determinative split exists.\n\n3.  **The \"Poor Vehicle\" Argument Looms Large:** The respondent has presented a compelling, multi-pronged argument that this specific case is an unsuitable vehicle for deciding the question presented. This is a classic and often successful reason for denying certiorari.\n    *   **Factual Weakness:** The respondent has painted a picture of a school district that made \"persistent efforts\" to accommodate the student. If the facts suggest the district would win even under a lower standard of intent, the Supreme Court would be issuing an advisory opinion, which it avoids.\n    *   **Mootness/Low Stakes:** The revelation that the petitioner has already received injunctive relief and compensation through a separate FAPE action dramatically lowers the stakes of this specific lawsuit. It removes the urgency and suggests the petitioner has already been made whole, making this a less compelling case for the Court's limited resources.\n\n4.  **The Heightened Standard Has a Coherent Rationale:** I now understand the defense of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is not based on the text of the ADA/Rehab Act, but on prudential and structural grounds. It is presented as a necessary judicial tool to harmonize the IDEA's specific procedural regime with the ADA's broad anti-discrimination mandate, rooted in the principle of judicial deference to educational professionals established in cases like *Monahan* and *Endrew F*.\n\nIn summary, the BIO has provided the Court with multiple, strong, independent reasons to deny the petition. My belief in a cert grant has significantly decreased. The observation confirms that my analysis is now at a critical juncture, pending the petitioner's final opportunity to counter these arguments in their reply brief. My predictive model is now waiting for that specific input to see if the petitioner can successfully challenge the \"no split\" and \"poor vehicle\" narratives.",

The most critical missing piece of information is the Respondent's counter-argument. I need to see how they will defend the 'bad faith or gross misjudgment' standard against the Petitioner's textual and structural attacks. Obtaining the Respondent's Brief on the Merits is therefore the highest priority action to reduce my uncertainty about the final outcome.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation fundamentally transforms my understanding of the case and the predictive task. My search for the Petitioner's Reply Brief, a pre-certiorari document, unexpectedly yielded the Petitioner's *Brief on the Merits*. This is a definitive signal that the Supreme Court has **granted certiorari**. The central uncertainty of my previous belief state\u2014whether the Court would agree to hear the case\u2014has been resolved. The Court has decided to intervene. My task is no longer to predict a cert grant but to predict the final ruling on the merits.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs, radically updated by this new reality, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important:** The Court's decision to grant review, despite the Respondent's powerful Brief in Opposition (BIO), is the most significant signal to date. It indicates that at least four Justices were not persuaded by the Respondent's arguments that the circuit split was \"illusory\" or that this case was a \"poor vehicle.\"\n    *   **The Circuit Split is Cert-Worthy:** The Court's action validates the Petitioner's framing. The Justices evidently perceive a genuine, outcome-determinative conflict between the circuits applying the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard and those applying a \"deliberate indifference\" or other standard. The Respondent's attempt to harmonize the circuits by arguing they were substantively similar has failed to prevent review.\n    *   **The \"Poor Vehicle\" Argument Failed:** The Court was not deterred by the Respondent's claims about the case's factual weakness or the supposed mootness due to other relief A.J.T. received. The grant of certiorari implies the Court believes the legal question is squarely presented and important enough to decide, regardless of these case-specific factual disputes.\n\n2.  **The Merits Battle is Joined, with a Strong Textualist Opening:** The case has now advanced to the merits stage. The observation provides the Petitioner's opening argument, the Brief for Petitioner, which outlines a multi-pronged attack on the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. My analysis of the brief's structure and arguments reveals a clear strategy:\n    *   **Atextual and Asymmetric:** The core of the Petitioner's argument, led by counsel Roman Martinez, is that the *Monahan* rule is a judicial invention with \"absolutely no basis in the relevant statutory text.\" The brief argues that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provide uniform protections for \"any person\" and do not authorize courts to create a special, heightened standard for children in school settings. This directly targets the judicially-created nature of the rule, an approach likely to resonate with the Court's textualist and originalist members.\n    *   **Violation of Statutory Structure:** The brief presents a new and powerful argument: that the *Monahan* rule violates the IDEA's \"savings clause,\" 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l). This provision explicitly states that the IDEA does not restrict rights or remedies available under other federal laws, including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The Petitioner argues that by making it *harder* for a student to win an ADA claim than an IDEA claim, the *Monahan* rule does exactly what \u00a7 1415(l) forbids.\n    *   **Undermining Congressional Goals:** The brief argues that the heightened standard undermines the core purpose of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, which were enacted to combat discrimination born of \"thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014of benign neglect,\" not just \"invidious animus.\"\n    *   **Appeal to Current Jurisprudence:** The brief strategically cites recent Court decisions like *Perez v. Sturgis*, *Groff v. DeJoy*, and *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis*, as well as a law review article by Justice Kavanaugh, all of which emphasize a strict adherence to statutory text over judicial policy-making. This is a clear attempt to align their argument with the Court's current interpretive methodology.\n\n3.  **The Respondent's Rationale is Now the Defensive Position:** My prior understanding of the rationale for the heightened standard (harmonizing the IDEA and ADA, judicial deference to educators) remains crucial. However, it is no longer just a reason to deny cert; it is now the central argument the Respondent, represented by Lisa Blatt, must defend on the merits. The Petitioner's brief directly attacks this rationale as \"flawed policy analysis, not law,\" setting up a direct clash between a textualist interpretation and a structural/prudential one.\n\nIn summary, the grant of certiorari is a watershed moment. It confirms the significance of the legal question and the reality of the circuit split in the Court's eyes. My belief in a potential victory for the Petitioner has increased substantially. The focus now shifts entirely to the merits, where the Petitioner has opened with a forceful, text-based argument that appears well-tailored to the current Supreme Court's jurisprudence. I now await the Respondent's Brief on the Merits to see how they will defend the judicially-created *Monahan* rule against this direct textual and structural assault.",

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n2: 20241218142135425_Osseo20Area20Schs.20Certificate20of20Word20Count.json (score: 0.398)\nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n___________ \n \nNo. 24-249 \n \nA.J.T., BY AND THROUGH HER PARENTS, A.T. & G.T.,  \nPETITIONER, \n \nv. \n \nOSSEO AREA SCHOOLS, INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 279, ET AL.,  \nRESPONDENTS. \n___________ \n \nCERTIFICATE OF WORD COUNT \n___________ \n \n \nI, Lisa S.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation consists of internal reasoning and a strategic plan for future information gathering. It does not introduce new facts, evidence, or arguments related to the case of *A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schools*. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain unchanged from my previous update, which was based on the discovery of the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs, which are stable after this observation, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important:** The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case is the pivotal event. This action confirms that at least four Justices view the circuit split over the appropriate standard for ADA/Rehabilitation Act claims in education as a significant and outcome-determinative issue. The Court was unpersuaded by the Respondent's arguments in their Brief in Opposition that the split was \"illusory\" or that this case was a \"poor vehicle\" for resolving it. My task has definitively shifted from predicting a cert grant to predicting the final ruling on the merits.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is Forcefully Textualist:** The Petitioner's Brief on the Merits, led by Roman Martinez, has framed the case as a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation. This strategy appears well-calibrated for the current Court.\n    *   **Atextual Standard:** The central claim is that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard applied by the Eighth Circuit (originating from *Monahan*) is a judicial invention with no foundation in the text of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. The brief argues these statutes apply a uniform standard of non-discrimination to \"any person\" and do not create a special, higher bar for students.\n    *   **Conflict with IDEA Savings Clause:** A powerful structural argument is that the heightened standard violates the IDEA's savings clause (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l)). This clause preserves rights and remedies under other federal laws. The Petitioner argues that by making it *harder* to bring an ADA claim than an IDEA claim, the *Monahan* rule illegally restricts rights that Congress explicitly saved.\n    *   **Alignment with Recent Precedent:** The Petitioner's strategy is bolstered by citations to recent Supreme Court decisions like *Perez v. Sturgis*, *Groff v. DeJoy*, and *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis*, which all emphasize adherence to statutory text over judicial policy-making. This positions the Petitioner's argument as consistent with the Court's current interpretive methodology.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Position is Defensive:** The rationales for the heightened standard (e.g., deference to educators, preventing the ADA from supplanting the IDEA's comprehensive scheme) are now the arguments the Respondent must defend on the merits. The Petitioner has preemptively framed these as \"flawed policy analysis, not law.\" The core legal battle will be between the Petitioner's textualist approach and the Respondent's structural/prudential defense of the judicially-created standard.\n\nThe internal reasoning in the current observation accurately reflects this belief state. My confidence in a potential victory for the Petitioner is significant, based on their opening brief. However, this prediction remains provisional. The most critical missing piece of evidence, as noted in the observation, is the Respondent's Brief on the Merits. I must analyze how Lisa Blatt and her team will defend the *Monahan* standard against this direct textual and structural assault before my belief state can be meaningfully updated further.",

The Reply Brief is, by its nature, a direct rebuttal to the Respondent's merits arguments.

This will substantially sharpen my understanding of the legal battleground and the likely weak points in the Respondent's case, providing high task-specific information gain. From a design perspective, this action reinforces the strategic importance of analyzing the full sequence of briefs, particularly the unique role of the reply brief in narrowing the issues and exposing the opponent's vulnerabilities.

In the \ndecision below, the Eighth Circuit held that for \ndiscrimination claims \u201cbased on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, these statutes \nare violated only if school officials acted with \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  That test \narbitrarily departs from the more lenient standards \nthat all courts\u2014including the Eighth Circuit\u2014apply \nto ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought by \nother plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (Pet.App.44a-45a) is not published, \nbut available at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota \ngranting \nrespondents\u2019 \nmotion \nfor \nsummary judgment (Pet.App.6a-43a) is not published \nbut available at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nentered \njudgment \non \nMarch 21, 2024 (Pet.App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(Pet.App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon \nCmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 158 (2017).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nresolving IEP-related disputes between families and \nschools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows courts to \naward only limited \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, \n15-16 (1993).  Such relief may include an \u201cinjunction\u201d \nor \u201creimbursement\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \n\n6 \n \n \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protections to victims of disability \ndiscrimination.  Unlike the IDEA, which applies only \nto the education of school-age children, the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act protect all Americans, both inside \nand outside the school setting.  As relevant here, the \nADA states that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act contains a similarly phrased \nprohibition that applies to recipients of federal \nfunding.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nDespite some \u201coverlap in coverage\u201d with the IDEA, \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act do different work \nwhen it comes to primary and secondary schools\u2019 \ntreatment of children with disabilities.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat \n170-71. \n \nWhereas \n\u201cthe \nIDEA \nguarantees \nindividually tailored educational services\u201d\u2014namely, \nan IEP designed to ensure that the child receives a \nFAPE\u2014the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cpromise \nnon-discriminatory access\u201d to education.  Id.  A school \ndistrict can therefore \u201cestablish a FAPE in compliance \nwith the IDEA, while nevertheless engaging in \ndiscriminatory \nconduct \nunder \nthe \nADA \n[and \nRehabilitation Act].\u201d  Lartigue v. Northside Indep. \nSch. Dist., 100 F.4th 510, 521 (5th Cir. 2024); accord \nLe Pape v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 103 F.4th 966, \n981 (3d Cir. 2024). \n\n7 \n \n \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nthat would enable people with disabilities to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program is \ndisability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170; see \nalso id. at 159-60.  Indeed, since the Rehabilitation \nAct became law in 1973, courts have uniformly \nunderstood that \u201ca refusal to accommodate the needs \nof a disabled person\u201d can \u201camount[] to discrimination \nagainst \nthe \nhandicapped\u201d \nif \nthe \nrequested \naccommodations are reasonable.  Se. Cmty. Coll. v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 412-13 (1979); accord Choate, \n469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.21. In 1990, Congress \nreaffirmed and adopted this longstanding principle \nwhen enacting the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2) \n(providing that people with disabilities are \u201cqualified\u201d \nfor public services, programs, or activities if they can \nparticipate \nwith \n\u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d);  \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) (requiring \u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d \nwhen \n\u201cnecessary \nto \navoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\u201d).    \nUnder both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \naccommodations are reasonable so long as they do not \nentail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the service in \nquestion \nor \nimpose \n\u201cundue \nfinancial \n[or] \nadministrative burdens\u201d on the regulated party.   \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.150(a)(3) (ADA); see also id. \u00a7 41.53 \n(Rehabilitation Act); Choate, 469 U.S. at 300 & n.20; \nK.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin Unified Sch. Dist., 725 \nF.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2013); Gorman v. Bartch, \n152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998). \n2.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cexpressly \nincorporate[]\u201d the same \u201crights and remedies provided \nunder Title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \n\n8 \n \n \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022).  The ADA provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in\u201d the \nRehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the remedies, procedures, \nand rights this subchapter provides to any person \nalleging discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133.  And the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, states that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth\u201d in Title VI \n\u201cshall be available to any person aggrieved by\u201d \ndisability discrimination inflicted by a person or \nentity subject to the Rehabilitation Act.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \nAccordingly, both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nfollow Title VI in \u201cauthoriz[ing] individuals,\u201d \nincluding children with disabilities, \u201cto seek redress \nfor violations\u201d by \u201cbringing suits\u201d for both \u201cinjunctive \nrelief\u201d and \u201cmoney damages.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160; \nsee also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 279-80 \n(2001) (observing that \u201cprivate individuals may sue\u201d \nunder \u201cTitle VI and obtain both injunctive relief and \ndamages\u201d).  In cases outside the educational context, \nthe courts of appeals unanimously agree that ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs can establish a \nstatutory violation\u2014and with it, eligibility for \ninjunctive relief\u2014if they show, on the merits, that the \ndefendant \nfailed \nto \nprovide \na \nreasonable \naccommodation to a covered person with a disability.1  \n \n1   See, e.g., Sosa v. Mass. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 80 F.4th 15, 30 (1st \nCir. 2023); Hamilton v. Westchester County, 3 F.4th 86, 91 \n(2d Cir. 2021); Durham v. Kelley, 82 F.4th 217, 225-26 \n(3d Cir. 2023); Richardson v. Clarke, 52 F.4th 614, 619 \n(4th Cir. 2022); Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d \n448, 455 (5th Cir. 2005); Finley v. Huss, 102 F.4th 789, 820-21 \n(6th Cir. 2024); Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, \n \n\n9 \n \n \nSuch plaintiffs need not make any specific showing of \nwrongful intent to prove a statutory violation and \nobtain injunctive relief.   \nFor compensatory damages, however, every circuit \nrequires \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nS.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 \nF.3d 248, 262 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  \nBecause \u201cprivate individuals [may] not recover \ncompensatory damages under Title VI except for \nintentional discrimination,\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. \nat 282-83, and because the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, supra \nat 7-8, ADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs may not \nobtain damages without proving that the defendant \nacted with a wrongful state of mind.  See S.H., 729 \nF.3d at 262.   \nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of courts hold that this intent \nrequirement for damages demands proof that the \ndefendant \nwas, \nat \na \nminimum, \n\u201cdeliberately \nindifferent\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected \nrights.  Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2015) (Jackson, J.) (collecting \ncases).  Those courts have done so based on this \nCourt\u2019s precedent adopting a deliberate indifference \nstandard under Title IX, which was likewise \u201cmodeled \nafter Title VI.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n \n465 F.3d 737, 750-51 (7th Cir. 2006) (en banc); Hall v. Higgins, \n77 F.4th 1171, 1180-81 (8th Cir. 2023); Payan v. L.A. Cmty.

George \nWashington Univ., 847 F.3d 740, 746-47 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  \n\n10 \n \n \n524 U.S. 274, 286, 290 (1998).2  This \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d test requires that a defendant ignore a \n\u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that the challenged action \n(or inaction) would \u201cresult in a violation of federally \nprotected rights.\u201d  Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 \nF.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011). \n3.  Although the circuits largely agree on the \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims outside the educational setting, they are \ndivided over whether those same standards apply to \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related \nclaims.   \nThe Third and Ninth Circuits apply the same \nstandards in these cases as they do in all others. \nPet.17-19.3  So do various district courts sitting in \nother circuits.  Pet.20 n.3.4  Five circuits, though, hold \nthat children with disabilities seeking relief for \neducation-related discrimination cannot establish a \n \n2   See, e.g., Loeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d \n268, 275 (2d Cir. 2009); S.H., 729 F.3d at 263-64; Basta v. Novant \nHealth Inc., 56 F.4th 307, 316-17 (4th Cir. 2022); Lacy v.

Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982).  There, the court \naffirmed the dismissal without prejudice of a \u201ccryptic\u201d \nRehabilitation Act claim alleging an \u201cimproper \neducational placement.\u201d  Id. at 1169-70.  To offer \u201ca \nfew words [of] guidance\u201d on remand, the court opined \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment should be \nshown\u201d before a Rehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be \nmade out\u201d in \u201cthe context of education of handicapped \nchildren.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  This heightened standard \nrequires proof that school officials departed so \n\u201csubstantially from accepted professional judgment, \npractice or standards as to demonstrate\u201d that they \n\u201cactually did not base the decision on [professional] \njudgment.\u201d  Est. of Barnwell ex rel. Barnwell v. \nWatson, 880 F.3d 998, 1004 (8th Cir. 2018). \nMonahan justified this harsh test based on a \nperceived \u201cduty to harmonize the Rehabilitation Act\u201d \nwith the IDEA\u2019s predecessor\u2014the EHA\u2014given that \nthe EHA specifically addressed the educational needs \nof children with disabilities.  687 F.2d at 1171.  \nAccording to Monahan, a heightened standard was \nnecessary to \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \n \n5  See, e.g., C.L. v. Scarsdale Union Free Sch. Dist., 744 \nF.3d 826, 841 (2d Cir. 2014); Sellers ex rel. Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of \nthe City of Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir. 1998); D.A. ex \nrel. Latasha A. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 629 F.3d 450, 454-55 \n(5th Cir. 2010); G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, 635 \n(6th Cir. 2013); Pet.App.5a & n.2. \n\n12 \n \n \nintended by Congress\u201d and achieve \u201cwhat [the court] \nbelieve[d] to be a proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id.  Monahan \ntherefore construed the EHA to limit the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder the Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nsubsequently \nextended \nMonahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard \nto claims brought by children under the ADA.  See \nHoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 283, \n103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th Cir. 1996).   \n4.  Two years after Monahan, Congress amended \nthe EHA by enacting what is now Section 1415(l) of \nthe IDEA.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161.  That provision, \nas amended, states in relevant part:  \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  In other words, Congress \ndeclared that the IDEA does not \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the \nability of children with disabilities to obtain relief \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \n \nNevertheless, the Eighth Circuit has continued to \nrely on the IDEA to restrict ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct relief for school-age children with disabilities by \nlimiting liability to cases involving \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d by school officials.  See, e.g., B.M. ex rel. \nMiller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, \n\n13 \n \n \n887 (8th Cir. 2013); M.P. ex rel. K. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. \nNo. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 981-82 (8th Cir. 2003).  So have \nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits.  Supra \nat 10-11 & n.5 (collecting cases).  \nB. Factual Background \nBecause this case comes to the Court on the \nDistrict\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the evidence \nmust be viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to [Ava].\u201d  \nTolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 657 (2014) (per curiam).  \nThat \nevidence \nshows \nthat \nthe \nDistrict \nhas \nsystematically discriminated against Ava in violation \nof the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act.  \nSince Ava was six months old, she has suffered \nfrom \u201ca rare form of epilepsy\u201d known as Lennox-\nGastaut Syndrome.  Pet.App.6a, 50a.  Ava\u2019s condition \nseverely impacts her ability to function.  For example, \nAva \nhas \n\u201csignificantly \ndiminished \nintellectual \ncapacities\u201d and she requires \u201cassistance with \neveryday tasks like walking and toileting.\u201d  Id.  Ava \nalso suffers from \u201cseizures throughout the day.\u201d  Id. \nat 50a.  Her seizures \u201ccreat[e] safety concerns and \ninterfer[e] with her capacity to learn.\u201d  JA515.  The \nseizures \u201care so frequent in the morning that [Ava] \ncan\u2019t attend school before noon.\u201d  Pet.App.50a.  From \nthen on, however, Ava is \u201calert and able to learn until \nabout 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id.   \nAva\u2019s parents and physicians recognized this \npattern early on and developed a plan to help her \nachieve her educational and personal goals.  JA479-\n81, 510-16.  Since preschool, Ava has slept late and \navoided activities before midday.  JA479-81.  And \nuntil Ava was 10 years old, educational professionals \nrespected these limitations.  See, e.g., JA497-507.  \nIndeed, Ava\u2019s public school district in Kentucky \n\n14 \n \n \nadequately addressed her needs, including by \nproviding \n\u201cevening \ninstruction \nat \nhome.\u201d  \nPet.App.50a.   \nIn 2015, when Ava was ten years old, her family \nmoved to Minnesota.  But her new school district \nthere, respondent Osseo Area Schools, refused to \nprovide her with the same accommodation.  Id.  \u201cYear \nafter year,\u201d the District \u201cdenied [Ava\u2019s] parents\u2019 \nrequests for evening instruction\u201d based on \u201ca series of \nshifting explanations.\u201d  Id.  Initially, the District \n\u201cclaimed that state law d[id] not require\u201d adjusting \nAva\u2019s instructional hours.  Id.  Then, the District \u201csaid \nit needed to avoid setting unfavorable precedent for \nitself and other districts.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd later, it said that \nthe home environment would be too restrictive,\u201d while \ndemanding more \u201cdata\u201d to justify a \u201cprogramming \nchange.\u201d  Id.   \nAll told, over her first three years in Minnesota, \nAva received only 4.25 hours of instruction per day\u2014\njust 65% of what her non-disabled peers received.  Id.; \nsee id. at 8a.  Rather than provide a full day of \nprofessional instruction by a teacher, the District \nopined that Ava\u2019s parents \u201cshould hire a personal care \nattendant after school hours.\u201d  JA495. \nIn 2018, the District insisted on truncating Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time even further.  As Ava prepared to \nenter middle school, the District abruptly amended \nher IEP to \u201ccut[] back her day to about 3 hours\u201d\u2014less \nthan half of what her peers would receive.  \nPet.App.51a; see id. at 8a.  Despite this latest setback, \nAva\u2019s parents continued to seek a workable \ncompromise with the District.  They made \u201cvarious \nproposals to at least maintain [Ava\u2019s] 4.25-hour day,\u201d \nincluding keeping her at the elementary school, \n\n15 \n \n \nwhere the school day was longer.  Id. at 51a. The \nDistrict rejected all of their proposals.  Id.   \nThroughout this period, Ava\u2019s parents repeatedly \ncomplained to the District that its refusal to provide \nAva \u201ca full day of school equal to her peers was \ndiscriminatory and did not comply with\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  JA484, 440-41.  But despite \nfederal regulatory requirements and a written \nDistrict policy requiring investigation of such \ncomplaints, the District refused to investigate or \nresolve these complaints.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.7; 28 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 35.107; JA80-83, 485. \nInstead, the District claimed credit for supposedly \ngiving Ava an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d to other students, \nbased on its willingness to tolerate Ava\u2019s delayed start \nto the school day and its restraint in not filing a \njuvenile \u201ctruancy action\u201d against her parents.  JA70-\n73, 84. \nC. Procedural History \n1. After years of frustration, Ava\u2019s parents \n\u201c[r]ealiz[ed] that an agreement [with the District] was \nbeyond reach,\u201d so they filed an IDEA complaint with \nthe \nMinnesota \nDepartment \nof \nEducation.  \nPet.App.51a.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held \na five-day hearing and concluded that the District had \nviolated the IDEA by depriving Ava of a FAPE.  See \nJA450-78. \nThe ALJ found that the District\u2019s \u201cproffered \nreasons\u201d for denying her a full school day were \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d and \u201cmore pretextual than real.\u201d  JA468, \n471.  It explained that the District\u2019s \u201cprevailing and \nparamount consideration\u201d had never been Ava\u2019s \u201cneed \nfor instruction,\u201d but rather its own desire \u201cto \n\n16 \n \n \nsafeguard the ordinary end-of-the-workday departure \ntimes for its faculty and staff.\u201d  JA468, 471-72, 475.   \nThe ALJ accordingly ordered the District to \n\u201crevise\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP to include evening instruction and \nother services.  JA476-77.  In so doing, the ALJ \nrejected the District\u2019s proposal of providing a mere \nthree hours of daily instructional time and instead \ndirected the District to provide 5.75 hours, which is \nwhat Ava had received in Kentucky.  JA444, 473-78.  \nThe ALJ also ordered \u201c495 hours of compensatory \neducational instruction,\u201d limiting relief to what the \nALJ believed was the proper two-year \u201climitations \nperiod\u201d under the IDEA.  JA474, 477.6 \n2. The parties then proceeded to federal court.  \nThe District challenged the ALJ\u2019s IDEA ruling.  For \nher part, Ava sued the District under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.   \nAva\u2019s lawsuit under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct sought an injunction that would \u201cpermanently \nsecure [her] rights to a full school day.\u201d  JA21, 24-25; \nsee also JA496.  That injunction would also give her \n\u201cthe opportunity\u201d to participate in non-instructional \nservices \nthat \n\u201ctypical \nkids \nget,\u201d \nsuch \nas \nextracurricular \nactivities, \nwhere \nfeasible \nwith \nreasonable accommodations for her disability.  JA2, \n20-25, 27-28, 318; see also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(4) \n(permitting \nschool \nofficials \nto \nrevise \nIEPs \n\u201cperiodically\u201d).   \n \n6  The District continued to evade its obligations after the \nALJ\u2019s order.  For example, the District \u201cconsistently cancelled \ninstructional sessions,\u201d and its instructors were regularly \u201clate.\u201d  \nJA491.  The District also took six months to comply with the \nALJ\u2019s order to provide eye-gaze technology, Ava\u2019s \u201cmost efficient \nand versatile means of communication.\u201d  JA464, 491. \n\n17 \n \n \nIn \naddition, \nAva \nrequested \n\u201ccompensatory \ndamages\u201d for the entire duration of her mistreatment, \ninvoking the six-year limitations period governing \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought in \nMinnesota.  JA2, 24, 28; see also Gaona v. Town & \nCountry \nCredit, \n324 \nF.3d \n1050, \n1054-56 \n(8th Cir. 2003) (noting absence of express statute of \nlimitations under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nand applying Minnesota\u2019s \u201csix-year limitations period \nfor personal injury actions\u201d); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C) \n(establishing a two-year statute of limitations under \nthe IDEA).  Those damages included expenses that \nwould \u201cnot be fully reimbursed in the IDEA \nproceedings,\u201d such as costs of hiring outside \nspecialists to assist Ava with speech, walking, and \ntoileting.  JA23-24.   \nThe district court upheld Ava\u2019s victory on her \nIDEA claim before the ALJ.  See JA542-95.  The court \nagreed with the ALJ that \u201cthe District\u2019s shifting \nreasons for denying the in-home instruction [Ava] \nseeks to make up for the morning hours she is not in \nschool were never based on [Ava]\u2019s needs.\u201d  JA544.  \nRather, \u201cwhen there was a conflict between [Ava\u2019s] \nneed for instruction and the school\u2019s regular hours, \nthe regular hours of the faculty were always the \nprevailing consideration.\u201d  JA574.  The court \ncriticized the District\u2019s \u201csteadfast[] refusal\u201d to extend \nAva\u2019s school day, noting that \u201c[a]dministrative \nconvenience is not an excuse for impermissibly \nshortening the instructional time a disabled child \nreceives.\u201d  JA574-75. \nThe district court further noted the harm \nassociated with the District\u2019s unwillingness to provide \nAva a full day of instruction.  It emphasized that Ava \nhad \u201clost the capacity\u201d to \u201cuse a variety of signs that \n\n18 \n \n \nshe had used in Kentucky,\u201d to \u201cvoid on the toilet 50% \nof the time,\u201d and to \u201cinteract with peers by using \nassistive technology to initiate or return a greeting.\u201d  \nJA582-83.    \nThe court ultimately held that Ava \u201crequires more \nthan 4.25 hours of schooling a day to have an \neducational program\u201d that \u201cwill allow her to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  JA595.  It thus agreed that \n\u201c[e]xtending [Ava\u2019s] instructional day until 6:00 pm \nand including compensatory hours of instruction\u201d was \n\u201cthe appropriate remedy\u201d under the IDEA.  Id.  \nAs to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, however, \nthe district court granted summary judgment against \nAva and in favor of the District.  The court explained \nthat to prove a violation of those statutes under \nMonahan, Ava had to show that the District had acted \nwith \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.24a-\n25a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171.  Applying \nMonahan\u2019s heightened standard, the district court \nconcluded that the District\u2019s actions \u201cdid not rise to \nth[at] level.\u201d  Pet.App.30a. \n3. In two published opinions by Judge Kobes \nissued \nin \nMarch \n2024, \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nunanimously affirmed both rulings.  See id. at \n49a-57a (IDEA decision); id. at 1a-5a (ADA and \nRehabilitation Act decision). \nIn the IDEA ruling, the Eighth Circuit agreed that \nAva had not received a FAPE based on \u201c[s]everal\u201d \nfacts.  Id. at 54a.  First, Ava had made \u201conly slight \nprogress in a few areas\u201d while in the District\u2019s care.  \nId.  Second, Ava \u201cregressed in toileting\u201d so drastically \nthat the District had \u201cremoved her toileting goal\u201d \naltogether, citing only a \u201clack of time in the short \nday\u2014not [a] lack of ability to improve.\u201d  Id. at \n\n19 \n \n \n55a-56a.  Third, \u201cexpert testimony\u201d confirmed that \nAva \u201cwould have made more progress\u201d with \u201cevening \ninstruction.\u201d  Id. at 56a-57a.  The court also sharply \ncriticized the District, emphasizing that its decisions \nhad \u201c[n]ever been grounded in [Ava]\u2019s individual \nneeds.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  \nDespite ruling for Ava on her IDEA claim, the \nEighth Circuit regretfully rejected her ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Like the district court, the \nEighth Circuit found itself \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan, \nwhich required Ava to establish \u201c\u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019\u201d by the District.  Id. at 3a-4a (quoting \n687 F.2d at 1171).  The court recognized that Ava \n\u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether \nthe \ndistrict \nwas \nnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent.\u201d  Id. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under \nMonahan,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthat\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  Id.  Because her case involved \u201c\u2018educational \nservices for disabled children,\u2019\u201d Ava had to \u201cprove that \nschool officials acted with \u2018either bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Id.  The court held that Ava \u201cha[d] \nfailed to identify conduct clearing Monahan\u2019s bar\u201d\u2014\nand thus could not obtain any relief as a matter of law.  \nId. at 4a-5a.   \nNotably, the Eighth Circuit expressed deep \ndiscomfort with Monahan imposing \u201csuch a high bar \nfor claims based on educational services\u201d brought by \nchildren with disabilities.  Id. at 5a n.2.  The court \nemphasized that \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other \ndisability-discrimination contexts.\u201d  Id.  In every \nother scenario, the court observed, \u201cno intent [is] \nrequired\u201d to establish liability and obtain injunctive \nrelief on a \u201cfailure-to-accommodate claim,\u201d while \n\u201cdamages\u201d \nclaims \nrequire \nonly \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference.\u201d  Id.   \n\n20 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit conceded that Monahan\u2019s \ncarve-out for school-age children with disabilities \nlacks \u201cany anchor in statutory text.\u201d  Id.  Rather, \nMonahan had \u201cspeculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act]\u2019s protections\u201d (and thus the \nADA\u2019s).  Id.  But the court pointed out that \u201cCongress \nrejected [that] premise\u201d in amendments to the EHA \nenacted \u201cjust a few years later.\u201d  Id. (citing \nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub. \nL. No. 99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l))).  Despite those amendments, the Eighth \nCircuit lamented, Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \n\u201cspread like wildfire\u201d across other courts.  Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit concluded that Monahan has \n\u201cbeen questioned\u201d by courts and commentators alike.  \nId.  It declared that the decision stands as \u201ca lesson in \nwhy\u201d courts should not \u201c\u2018add provisions\u2019\u201d to \u201c\u2018federal \nstatute[s]\u2019\u201d that aren\u2019t there.  Id. (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 \nU.S. 330, 352 (2010)).  Nevertheless, the court \nobserved that Monahan \u201cremains the law of [this] \ncircuit\u201d\u2014at least \u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Id. \n4.  In June 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied Ava\u2019s \npetition for rehearing en banc.  Id. at 44a-45a.  Judges \nGrasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented, noting that they \nwould grant the petition.  Id. at 44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a rule \nstating that, unlike all other ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct plaintiffs, children with disabilities seeking relief \nfor education-related discrimination must prove \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d to establish a statutory \n\n21 \n \n \nviolation. Id. at 1170-71.  Monahan is wrong.  The \nADA and Rehabilitation Act require courts to apply \nthe same legal standards to all plaintiffs, including \nchildren with disabilities bringing claims arising in \nthe educational setting.  \nA.  Nothing in the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nremotely suggests that those statutes apply different \nlegal standards to different categories of plaintiffs.  \nThe statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions establish \nuniform, \nacross-the-board \nprotections \nagainst \ndisability discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And their remedial provisions \nstate that \u201cany person\u201d who suffers disability \ndiscrimination may obtain the same relief\u2014without \nexceptions or limitations for school-age children or \nanyone else.  See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133; 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \n \nBy reading the same operative language in the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to establish a different \nstandard in this single factual context, Monahan \nengaged \nin \nnothing \nless \nthan \n\u201cinterpretive \ncontortion.\u201d  United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, \n522 (2008).  This Court has firmly rejected the \n\u201cdangerous principle that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d  \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005).  So the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s plain text forecloses \nMonahan\u2019s bespoke standard uniquely disfavoring \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nvictimized \nby \ndiscrimination at school. \nB.  Monahan adopted its atextual rule because the \nEighth Circuit perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nIDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, so as to \u201cgive each \nof these statutes the full play intended by Congress.\u201d  \n687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That reasoning violates \n\n22 \n \n \nCongress\u2019s later unambiguous command in 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l) that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, \nand remedies available\u201d to children with disabilities \nunder the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and other federal \nlaws.  Construing the IDEA to restrict the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder other statutes is exactly what Section 1415(l) \nforbids. \nC.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s history and \npurposes confirm that Monahan is deeply misguided.  \nCongress enacted these laws to protect \u201call disabled \nindividuals\u201d\u2014equally.  135 Cong. Rec. 19895 (Sept. 7, \n1989) (Statement of Sen. Joe Lieberman) (emphasis \nadded); see, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. 29632 (Sept. 13, \n1973).  And Congress recognized that disability \ndiscrimination is \u201cmost often the product, not of \ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nGiven those legislative goals, it is clear that the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act do not treat school-age \nchildren with disabilities worse than other plaintiffs.  \nAnd the statutes were not meant to condition \nliability\u2014for anyone\u2014on a showing of outright \nanimus or severe misconduct.  Monahan was plainly \nwrong to require children to prove \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to prove disability discrimination, \nparticularly given their special vulnerabilities and \nthe acute risks of lifelong harms in the educational \ncontext. \nD.  Monahan\u2019s rule is unfair and leads to bizarre \nresults.  Its additional barrier to relief senselessly \ndisadvantages vulnerable children like Ava by \nmaking it harder for them to prove ADA and \n\n23 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act claims.  In doing so, Monahan \nundermines incentives for schools to comply with \ntheir statutory obligations in the first place.  And \ndespite \nseverely \ndisadvantaging \nprimary \nand \nsecondary \nstudents \nin \nthis \nway, \nMonahan \ninexplicably excuses from its heightened standard \ncollege students bringing education-related claims for \ndisability discrimination.  That disparate treatment \nmakes no sense. \nE.  At its core, Monahan\u2019s asymmetric standard is \nbased on flawed policy, not law.  Monahan purported \nto seek \u201ca proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  687 F.2d at \n1171.  But Congress itself struck that proper balance \nby granting broad relief to all plaintiffs under the \nuniform standards set forth in the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  In any event, Monahan\u2019s policy \nconcerns are themselves misguided:  There is no \nsound basis for singling out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under those \nstatutes.   \nARGUMENT \nMONAHAN\u2019S ATEXTUAL AND ASYMMETRIC \nRULE SHOULD BE REJECTED \nForty-three years ago, in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit \noffered this \u201cguidance\u201d to lower courts:  Before a \nRehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in \u201cthe \ncontext of education of handicapped children,\u201d the \nplaintiff must show that the defendant acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  \nMonahan is wrong.  Courts must apply the same legal \n\n24 \n \n \nstandards to all claims brought under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, regardless of who the plaintiff is \nor how her claims arose. \nA. The Statutory Text Establishes Uniform \nRules Governing All Claims  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision below correctly \nrecognized that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act is \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive prohibitions and \nremedial provisions offer \u201cno indication that Congress \nintended\u201d for the legal standard a plaintiff must \nsatisfy \u201cto turn on the type of [claim] being [brought].\u201d  \nAli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 220-21 \n(2008).  Rather, they establish uniform standards \nthat courts must apply even-handedly\u2014to everyone.  \nSo the baseline rules that govern in all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases must govern claims brought \nby \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nchallenging \ndiscrimination at school. \n1.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive \nprohibitions create a single standard governing all \nclaims brought under each statute.  Section 202 of the \nADA provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act establishes a materially identical \nprohibition for recipients of federal funding.  See 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nThese expansive prohibitions forbid not just \nactions motivated by \u201cinvidious animus\u201d or other \n\n25 \n \n \negregious misconduct toward people with disabilities, \nbut \nalso \nconduct \nstemming \nfrom \nmere \n\u201cthoughtlessness and indifference\u201d toward their \nunique needs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985) \n(addressing \nRehabilitation \nAct). \n \nThe \nprovisions \naccordingly \nrequire \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations\u201d in order \u201cto assure meaningful \naccess\u201d to public or federally funded services, \nprograms, and activities to which \u201cotherwise qualified \nhandicapped individuals\u201d are \u201centitled.\u201d  Id. at 301.  \nFailure to provide such accommodations violates both \nstatutes.  See Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. \n154, 170 (2017); supra at 7.  And contrary to \nMonahan, nothing in either law remotely suggests \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d must be \nshown\u2014by anyone\u2014before a statutory \u201cviolation\u201d can \nbe \u201cmade out.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  \nThe text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprohibitions gives no hint that education-related \nclaims brought by children with disabilities should be \ntreated differently from all other claims seeking relief \nunder the same operative provision.  And this Court \nhas firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle that \njudges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  The \u201csame word[s]\u201d in the \u201csame \nstatutory provisions\u201d must have the same meaning, \neven \u201cin different factual contexts.\u201d  United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (emphasis omitted). \nBy reading the same operative language to \nestablish \na \ndifferent \nstandard \nin \njust \none \ncircumstance, Monahan engaged in nothing less than \n\u201cinterpretive contortion.\u201d  Id.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act are not \u201cchameleon[s].\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Clark, 543 U.S at 382).  Their meaning \n\n26 \n \n \n\u201ccannot change\u201d whenever a child with disabilities \nalleges discrimination at the hands of school officials.  \nId.  Accordingly, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nacross-the-board prohibitions apply equally in all \ncases seeking relief under these statutes, no matter a \nplaintiff\u2019s age, the nature of her disability, or whether \nshe suffered discrimination in a school setting. \n2.  The statutes\u2019 remedial provisions reinforce that \nall plaintiffs must be treated equally.  Section 203 of \nthe ADA states that \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and \nrights set forth in\u201d the Rehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the \nremedies, procedures, and rights\u201d that the ADA \n\u201cprovides to any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133 (emphasis added).  And Section 505 of the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in \n[T]itle VI\u201d are \u201cavailable to any person aggrieved\u201d by \ndisability discrimination under the Rehabilitation \nAct.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added).  \n\u201cAny person\u201d means just that\u2014any person.  This \nlanguage requires equal treatment of all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  It leaves no room for \nexceptions or special rules making it more difficult for \ncertain classes of plaintiffs to prove their claims.  \n\u201cWhen used (as here) with a \u2018singular noun in \naffirmative contexts,\u2019 the word \u2018any\u2019 ordinarily \n\u2018refer[s] to a member of a particular group or class \nwithout distinction or limitation\u2019 and in this way \n\u2018impl[ies] every member of the class or group.\u2019\u201d  SAS \nInst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 363 (2018) \n(alterations in original) (quoting Oxford English \nDictionary (3d ed. 2016)).   \nMonahan thus had no textual basis \u201cto restrict the \nunqualified language\u201d of the ADA and Rehabilitation \n\n27 \n \n \nAct\u2019s remedial provisions by making it more difficult \nfor children with disabilities to prove discrimination \nin the educational context.  Brogan v. United States, \n522 U.S. 398, 403 (1998); accord Pet.App.5a n.2; Mark \nC. Weber, Accidently on Purpose: Intent in Disability \nDiscrimination Law, 56 B.C. L. Rev. 1417, 1455-61 \n(2015); Thomas Simmons, The ADA Prima Facie \nPlaintiff: A Critical Overview of Eighth Circuit Case \nLaw, 47 Drake L. Rev. 761, 822-23 & nn.370-71 \n(1999).  Like the statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions, \nthe remedial provisions expressly incorporating \nTitle VI\u2019s rights and remedies apply equally to victims \nof disability discrimination \u201cof whatever kind.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997).   \nAs for Title VI itself, that landmark civil-rights \nlaw likewise demands evenhanded enforcement.  \nTitle VI provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United \nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  This Court\u2019s \n\u201cprior decisions have found an implied right of action\u201d \nfor anyone who suffers such discrimination under \nTitle VI, which \u201cCongress has acknowledged\u201d in \nsubsequent \u201camendments to the statute.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). \nTitle \nVI\u2019s \nacross-the-board \nban \non \nracial \ndiscrimination supplies no basis for imposing a \nuniquely stringent standard on any class of plaintiffs, \nlet alone school-age children.  And no Title VI case has \never adopted a Monahan-like \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d rule for establishing a statutory \nviolation or obtaining any form of relief in the school \nsetting.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n\n28 \n \n \n279-80 (2001) (noting that \u201cboth injunctive relief and \ndamages\u201d are available under Title VI).  It follows \nthat courts \u201ccannot curate\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims and treat some differently from others.  \nSAS Inst., 584 U.S. at 359-60.  Rather, courts \u201cmust \ndecide them all\u201d under the same legal standards.  Id.   \n3.  This is not the only case this Term where the \nCourt will address whether to impose a more \nstringent\u2014and non-textual\u2014legal standard on only a \nsubset of anti-discrimination plaintiffs under the \nsame statute.  In Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth \nServices, No. 23-1039, the Sixth Circuit held that \nTitle VII plaintiffs who are members of a majority \ngroup\u2014but not members of minority groups\u2014must \nsatisfy not only \u201cthe usual [requirements] for \nestablishing a prima-facie case\u201d of discrimination, but \nalso \nan \nadditional \nrequirement \nof \nshowing \n\u201c\u2018background circumstances to support the suspicion \nthat the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u2019\u201d  Ames v. Ohio \nDep\u2019t of Youth Servs., 87 F.4th 822, 825 (6th Cir. \n2023).  This Court granted certiorari to decide \nwhether that extra requirement is correct.   \nNotably, \nthe \nAmes \nrespondent \nhas \nnow \nabandoned the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule and conceded that \n\u201cthe same legal standard applies to all Title VII \nplaintiffs,\u201d  Ames Resp. Br. 1, and that \u201cit is wrong to \nhold some litigants to a higher standard\u201d than others,  \nAmes Oral Argument Tr. 39.  Both parties in Ames, \nalong with the United States, are thus \u201cin radical \nagreement\u201d that Title VII \u201capplies the same to \neverybody,\u201d no matter who they are or the nature of \ntheir discrimination claim.  Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 39; \nAmes U.S. Amicus Br. 11-31.  This Court seems \nsimilarly inclined.  See Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 43-45, \n\n29 \n \n \n49-51, 54-56, 58-60.  The same even-handed approach \nshould govern the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, too. \n4.  Neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act \nexpressly sets forth an intent requirement for proving \na statutory violation or for obtaining particular kinds \nof relief.  And while this Court has not squarely \naddressed the issue, the lower courts generally agree \non the baseline standards governing ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.   \nOutside the educational context, the courts of \nappeals uniformly hold that plaintiffs can show a \nviolation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2014and by \nextension, establish eligibility for injunctive relief\u2014if \nthey prove that the defendant failed to provide a \nreasonable accommodation to a covered person with a \ndisability.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1.  No showing of \nwrongful intent is required.  Id.   \nFor damages, though, virtually all courts have \nheld that plaintiffs outside the educational setting \nmust prove a form of wrongful intent, consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s case interpreting Title VI.  Supra at 9; \nsee also Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 282-83 (requiring \nwrongful intent for damages claims under Title VI).  \nThe overwhelming majority have held that plaintiffs \nmay satisfy this intent requirement by proving that \nthe defendant acted with deliberate indifference\u2014i.e., \nignored a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that its conduct would \n\u201cresult in a violation of federally protected rights.\u201d  \nMeagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 \n(8th Cir. 2011); see also supra at 10 & n.2; Gebser v. \nLago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998) \n(holding that deliberate indifference is sufficient to \nshow such intent under Title IX, which was likewise \n\u201cmodeled after Title VI\u201d); Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185-89 \n(looking to Title IX precedent in determining the \n\n30 \n \n \nscope of private damages remedies available under \nthe ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Title VI). \n \nFor the reasons explained above, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nsubject \nall \ndiscrimination \nplaintiffs to the same legal standards.  As the United \nStates has noted, \u201cwhere courts have interpreted\u201d the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cto require proof of \ncertain elements for claims outside of the school \ncontext, they must do the same with claims in the \nschool context.\u201d  Suppl.Br.Add.11a (filed Oct. 7, 2024).  \nSo whichever baseline legal standards apply under \nthese statutes in other contexts must apply in this one \ntoo.  There is no textual basis for disfavoring children \nwith \ndisabilities \nwho \nsuffer \neducation-related \ndiscrimination.7 \nB. Monahan Violates Section 1415(l) \n \nMonahan justified its atextual rule primarily by \n\u201cspeculat[ing] that Congress intended the IDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d \nstatute\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s] protections.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \nTwo years later, Congress refuted that reasoning by \nproviding that \u201c[n]othing\u201d in the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or \nlimit[s]\u201d relief available under the ADA and \n \n7  Ava\u2019s question presented focuses only on whether \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related claims \nshould be subject to a heightened, context-specific standard for \nproving violations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Supra \nat i.  It does not ask the Court to decide what standard should \nuniformly govern all claims.  That said, the courts of appeals are \nclearly correct that intentional discrimination is not required to \nestablish a violation of either statute, especially when the claim \nalleges that the defendant failed to provide a reasonable \naccommodation.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1. \n\n31 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  Monahan \ndirectly violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s command.   \n1.  Monahan perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nEHA (now the IDEA) and Rehabilitation Act and \nprevent the latter from becoming a cause of action \u201cfor \neducational malpractice\u201d that would supplant the \nEHA.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  In other words, Monahan \nconstrued the EHA as an implicit constraint on \nRehabilitation Act claims brought in the school \nsetting\u2014one limiting liability and restricting relief to \nrare cases where children with disabilities can prove \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d by school officials.  \nId.  According to Monahan, this step was needed to \n\u201cgive each of these statutes the full play intended by \nCongress.\u201d  Id. at 1171.   \nTwo years after Monahan was decided, this Court \nembraced a version of Monahan\u2019s logic.  In Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Court held that the \nEHA provided the \u201cexclusive avenue\u201d for children \nwith disabilities to bring discrimination claims \nrelated to their education.  Id. at 1009 (emphasis \nadded).  The Court reasoned that the EHA establishes \n\u201ca comprehensive scheme\u201d that focused directly on \n\u201cpublic education for handicapped children.\u201d  Id.  \nBecause \nthat \nscheme \ngives \n\u201clocal \nand \nstate \neducational agencies the primary responsibility for \ndeveloping a plan to accommodate the needs of each \nindividual handicapped child,\u201d the Court found it \n\u201cdifficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave \nundisturbed the ability of a handicapped child\u201d to \nassert other \u201cvirtually identical\u201d causes of action.  Id. \nat 1009, 1011.  Smith thus decreed that the EHA did \nnot just limit Rehabilitation Act relief for school-age \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \n(as \nMonahan \nhad \n\n32 \n \n \nconcluded), but fully displaced that statute in the \nschool setting. \nCongress swiftly repudiated Smith\u2019s reasoning\u2014\nand with it, Monahan\u2019s as well.  In 1986, Congress \namended the EHA (now the IDEA) to \u201c\u2018reaffirm[] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA [and \nRehabilitation Act] \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less \nintegral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of \nhandicapped children.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 4, 6 (1985)); see also S. Rep. \nNo. 99-112, at 2 (1985).  Now codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l), this IDEA amendment provides in relevant \npart: \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); see also Handicapped Children\u2019s \nProtection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-372, \u00a7 3, 100 \nStat. 796, 797 (HCPA).   \nCongress thus expressly established a rule of \nconstruction under which the IDEA cannot be \ninterpreted to \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the ability of children \nwith disabilities to obtain relief under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act.  Id.  In doing so, Congress made \nclear that while these various statutes \u201coverlap\u201d in \nsome respects, they are different in important ways \nand retain full independent force.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 171.  \u201cThe IDEA offers federal funds to States in \nexchange for a commitment: to furnish a \u2018free \nappropriate public education\u2019\u201d to \u201call children with \n\n33 \n \n \ncertain physical or intellectual disabilities.\u201d  Id. at \n158.  By contrast, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \neach \nguarantee \n\u201cnon-discriminatory \naccess \nto\u201d \neducational services for children with disabilities, as \ncompared to their non-disabled peers.  Id. at 170-71.  \nSection 1415(l) establishes that the latter guarantee \ncoexists with, and cannot be subordinated to, the \nformer. \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s drafters repeatedly emphasized \nwhat the text makes clear.  One HCPA co-sponsor, for \nexample, declared that the IDEA was never \u201cintended \nto \nin \nany \nway \nlimit \nhandicapped \nchildren\u2019s \neducational rights or the remedies for protecting \nthose rights.\u201d  131 Cong. Rec. 21391 (July 30, 1985) \n(statement of Sen. Ted Kennedy) (emphasis added).  \nAnother explained that Section 1415(l) commands \nthat the IDEA must be interpreted to \u201cenhance\u201d the \nremedies available to children with disabilities \n\u201cunder other laws\u201d\u2014not to \u201climit[]\u201d or \u201creplace\u201d them.  \nId. at 21392 (statement of Sen. Paul Simon).  And the \nreport from the House Committee on Education and \nLabor reiterated that the IDEA may not \u201cbe construed \nto modify traditional standards used by the courts for \ndetermining\u201d when relief \u201cis appropriate\u201d under the \nRehabilitation Act and other federal laws (such as the \nlater-enacted ADA).  H.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 7.  \nThese sources confirm the statutory text\u2019s plain \nmeaning. \n2.  Monahan violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s directive.  \nMonahan held that the IDEA (formerly the EHA) \nrequires interpreting the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nto require children with disabilities to show bad faith \nor gross misjudgment to prevail on education-related \ndiscrimination claims.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That is, \nMonahan interpreted the IDEA to \u201crestrict\u201d and \n\n34 \n \n \n\u201climit\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d available to \nchildren like Ava under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct by requiring them to satisfy a more stringent \nstandard than anyone else suing under these \nstatutes.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  That is precisely what \nSection 1415(l) forbids.  See Howell ex rel. Howell v. \nWaterford Pub. Schs., 731 F. Supp. 1314, 1318 (E.D. \nMich. 1990) (criticizing Monahan for violating Section \n1415(l)). \nThe \nDistrict \nresisted \nthis \nstraightforward \nconclusion in its brief opposing certiorari.  There, the \nDistrict asserted that Section 1415(l) \u201coverruled \nSmith\u201d\u2014\u201cnot Monahan\u201d\u2014and did not \u201copine on the \nstandard governing\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims.  BIO31.  That misses the point.  Congress \nundoubtedly sought to reject Smith, but Smith and \nMonahan both adopted the same flawed view that the \nIDEA implicitly restricts the scope of other federal \nanti-discrimination statutes, as applied to children \nwith disabilities suffering from discrimination in the \neducational context.   \nWhatever particular precedent Congress had in \nmind, Section 1415(l)\u2019s text flatly prohibits Monahan\u2019s \nconstruction of the IDEA to limit relief available \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  So even \nthough Section 1415(l) does not set forth legal \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims, it still squarely \u201creject[s] Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d \nthat the IDEA requires a uniquely stringent standard \nfor ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, as the Eighth \nCircuit recognized in its decision below.  Pet.App.5a \nn.2.  Section 1415(l) leaves no doubt that Monahan\u2019s \natextual and asymmetric rule is wrong. \n\n35 \n \n \nC. Monahan Undermines The Core Goals Of \nThe ADA And Rehabilitation Act \nMonahan\u2019s judicially invented rule requiring only \nschool-age children with disabilities to prove bad faith \nor gross misjudgment violates the central purpose of \nboth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Congress \nenacted those statutes to protect all Americans living \nwith disabilities from discrimination.  Nothing \nsuggests that Congress wanted to diminish the extent \nof that protection for anyone with a disability\u2014let \nalone for school-age children, who are perhaps the \nmost vulnerable subset of such people.  And because \nboth statutes were designed to remedy passive \nneglect, it is clear Congress did not intend to limit \nrelief solely to cases involving outright animus or \negregious misconduct for any class of plaintiffs. \n1.  The goal of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nwas, as Senator Ted Kennedy explained, \u201cnothing less \nthan to give every disabled American a fair share of \nthe American Dream.\u201d  Americans With Disabilities \nAct of 1989: Hearing on S. 933 Before the Subcomm. \non the Handicapped of the S. Comm. On Labor & \nHum. Res., 101st Cong. 223 (1989) (emphasis added) \n(discussing ADA).  The legislative history of both \nstatutes confirms Congress\u2019s desire to promote equal \ntreatment of all Americans with disabilities, across \nthe board. \nFor example, in enacting the Rehabilitation Act, \nSenator Alan Cranston described Congress\u2019s goal as \nprotecting all of the \u201c9.8 million handicapped persons\u201d \nthen living in the United States.  119 Cong. Rec. at \n29631-32; see also S. Rep. No. 93-391, at 45 (1973) \n(observing that the statute prohibits the denial of \nservices to \u201cany handicapped individual\u201d based on the \nindividual\u2019s disability).  And later, when Congress \n\n36 \n \n \namended the Act to codify a private right of action, \nSenator Cranston emphasized that the statute was \nmeant to \u201cto remedy violations of [S]ection 504\u2014with \nno exception.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. S15104 (Oct. 3, 1986) \n(emphasis added).  Other legislators reiterated that, \n\u201c[s]ince initial passage of this law, Congress has\u201d \nsought to protect \u201cthe quality of life for all \nhandicapped persons.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. 28090 (Oct. 2, \n1986) (statement of Representative Mario Biaggi, \nco-sponsor of 1986 amendments) (emphasis added); \nsee also 131 Cong. Rec. at 21391 (statement of Sen. \nJohn Kerry, another co-sponsor) (similar). \nSo too for the ADA.  Representative Tony Coelho\u2014\nwho sponsored the legislation and, like Ava, suffers \nfrom epilepsy\u2014observed that the statute would also \nprotect \n\u201c[e]very \nAmerican,\u201d \nwithout \nexception.  \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1988: Joint \nHearing on S. 2345 Before the Subcomm. on the \nHandicapped of the S. Comm. on Labor & Hum. \nResources & the Subcomm. on Select Educ. of the H. \nComm. on Educ. & Labor, 100th Cong. 938 (1988).  \nHis colleagues agreed that the ADA was meant to \n\u201cbring equality to the lives of all Americans with \ndisabilities.\u201d  136 Cong. Rec. 17376 (July 13, 1990) \n(statement of Senator Bob Dole, an ADA sponsor) \n(emphasis added); see, e.g., 135 Cong. Rec. 19895 \n(Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Senator Warren \nRudman, another ADA sponsor, observing that the \nADA\u2019s \nprotections \n\u201cextend \nto \nall \ndisabled \nindividuals\u201d).   \n \nGiven these statements, it boggles the mind to \nthink that Congress wanted these important \nanti-discrimination statutes to disfavor certain \nclasses of plaintiffs with disabilities by requiring \nthem to satisfy a more stringent test than anyone \n\n37 \n \n \nelse.  Children with disabilities are among the most \nvulnerable members of our society.  Too often, they \nare \u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d while at \nschool.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (quoting 117 Cong. \nRec. 45974 (Dec. 9, 1971)).  Such discrimination in the \neducational context can inflict severe, life-altering \nharm.  See, e.g., Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. \n142, 145 (2023) (school district denied deaf student a \nqualified \naide \nfor \ntwelve \nyears, \ndrastically \ndiminishing his ability to communicate with others \nand earn a living). \n \nWhen such discrimination happens, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \ncrucial \nmeans \nof \n\u201cprotecting [victims\u2019] interests,\u201d just as those statutes \nassist other plaintiffs facing disability discrimination \nin other contexts.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 159.  There is no \nreason to think that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nsaddle children with disabilities\u2014and nobody else\u2014\nwith \u201can impossibly high bar\u201d for proving a statutory \nviolation.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023); see also Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act were meant to ensure equality, \nand their guarantees apply equally. \n \n2.  Even clearer is that Congress never wanted \ncourts to impose an intent requirement for liability on \nanyone suing under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \nespecially for failure to accommodate a disability.   \n \n\u201cDiscrimination against the handicapped was \nperceived by Congress to be most often the product, \nnot of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness \nand indifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 295.  Congress thus enacted the Rehabilitation \nAct to remedy \u201cshameful oversights\u201d and \u201cthe \ninvisibility of the handicapped in America.\u201d  Id. \nat 295-96 (first quoting 117 Cong. Rec. 45974 \n\n38 \n \n \n(Dec. 9, 1971); and then quoting, 118 Cong. Rec. \n525-26 (Jan. 20, 1972)).  The ADA was likewise \nenacted \nto \naddress \nhow \n\u201csociety \nhas \nbeen \ninadvertently structured in a way that unnecessarily \ndenies innumerable opportunities, great and small, to \npeople with disabilities.\u201d  Joint Hearing on S. 2345, \n100th Cong. at 941 (emphasis added).  The central \ngoal of these statutes, in other words, was to guard \nagainst \u201capathetic attitudes\u201d toward people with \ndisabilities.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 296.   \n \nMonahan\u2019s directive that a Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in the educational context \nonly by showing bad faith or gross misjudgment, 687 \nF.2d at 1171\u2014rather than mere \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as \nrequired from all other plaintiffs, Choate, 469 U.S. at \n295\u2014defies that objective.  With Congress so \nunmistakably focused on the widespread passive \nneglect of people with disabilities, it is inconceivable \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act excuse liability \nin any category of cases, just because the alleged \ndisability discrimination falls short of outright \nanimus or especially severe mistreatment.  So by \ngiving a free pass to actions driven by educational \nofficials\u2019 \u201capathetic attitudes,\u201d Monahan immunized \n\u201cmuch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in \npassing the Rehabilitation Act,\u201d as well as the ADA.  \nId. at 296-97.  Monahan is at odds with the core \npurpose of both statutes. \nD. Monahan \nIs \nUnfair \nAnd \nLeads \nTo \nArbitrary Results \nMonahan singles out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.  Beside openly defying the \nstatutory \ntext \nand \npurpose, \nthis \nasymmetric \n\n39 \n \n \ntreatment is fundamentally unfair and leads to \nbizarre results. \n1.  Whereas Monahan establishes an exceedingly \n\u201chigh bar for claims based on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, courts \u201crequire \nmuch \nless \nin \nother \ndisability-discrimination \ncontexts.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  That disparity matters, as \nthis case illustrates.   \nIt is hard enough for parents to muster the \nresources needed to fight for their child\u2019s federally \nprotected rights while simultaneously trying to \nremediate life-altering educational gaps in the \nmeantime.  Yet Monahan\u2019s heightened standard lets \nschool districts off the hook even when they act with \ndeliberate \nindifference \nto \nstudents\u2019 \nfederally \nprotected rights.  That additional barrier makes it \nexceedingly difficult for children with disabilities to \nobtain much-needed relief under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  It also blunts incentives for \nschools to fulfill their statutory responsibilities in the \nfirst place. \nHere, for example, Ava\u2019s parents spent years \nfighting for the District to give her the same \nreasonable accommodations that her prior school \ndistrict in Kentucky had provided without issue.  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  But over and over again, the \nDistrict refused, offering a series of \u201cshifting,\u201d \n\u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot credible\u201d explanations that had \nnothing to do with Ava\u2019s \u201cindividual needs.\u201d  Id. at \n50a, 57a; JA468, 471, 544; supra at 14-16.  Indeed, the \nDistrict\u2019s own Director of Student Services appeared \nunaware of the District\u2019s obligations under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act:  She repeatedly insisted\u2014\nincorrectly\u2014that providing a FAPE under the IDEA \nsatisfied the District\u2019s non-discrimination obligations \n\n40 \n \n \nunder these other statutes.  JA190 (rejecting notion \nthat \u201ca school district [can] provide a FAPE under \nIDEA and still discriminate on the basis of \ndisability\u201d); see also JA191-96, 208-09, 216-18, 240. \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit acknowledged the \nconsiderable evidence showing that the District had \nbeen \u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \ndenying \nthe \nreasonable \naccommodations \nshe \ndesperately needed.  Pet.App.3a.  The court also \npointedly criticized the District\u2019s deliberate \u201cchoice to \nprioritize its administrative concerns\u201d over Ava\u2019s \n\u201cindividual needs,\u201d while giving \u201ca series of shifting \nexplanations\u201d for failing to meet them.  Id. at 57a; see \nCA8 Appellant\u2019s Br.4-17, 50-55.  All this should have \nbeen more than sufficient for Ava to survive summary \njudgment and obtain both injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan, \n[i]t\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n2.  Ava\u2019s experience is all too common.  A Westlaw \nsearch reveals hundreds of district court decisions \napplying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases, with \nthe overwhelming majority denying relief.8  Many \n \n8  See, e.g., Parnes v. Orange Cnty. Sch. Bd., 2024 WL \n4290383, at *4-6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 25, 2024); S.F. v. Union Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 2024 WL 1316229, at *3-4 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 27, \n2024); Torres v. Stewart Cnty. Sch.

In Reid-Witt ex rel. C.W. \nv. District of Columbia, 486 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. \n2020), school officials refused to provide urgently \nneeded at-home instruction, even after a child \nsuffering from severe anxiety and depression \nexperienced \n\u201csuicidal \nideation \nthat \nrequired \nhospitalization.\u201d  Id. at 3-4.  The school baselessly \ninsisted that the child was \u201cineligible for special-\neducation services.\u201d  Id. at 4.  Yet the district court \ndenied relief, finding that the plaintiff could not \nsatisfy the \u201ctougher\u201d and \u201cmore stringent\u201d bad-faith-\nor-gross-misjudgment \nstandard, \nwhich \ncan \nbe \nsatisfied \u201c\u2018[o]nly in the rarest of cases.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 8-9 \n(quoting Walker v. District of Columbia, 157 F. Supp. \n2d 11, 36 (D.D.C. 2001)).  Because school officials were \nnot \u201ccompletely indifferent\u201d to the child\u2019s disability, \nthe court concluded, her ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims failed as a matter of law.  Id. at 9; see also N.G. \nv. District of Columbia, 556 F. Supp. 2d 11, 18-21, 36 \n(D.D.C. 2008) (similar).   \n \n(W.D. Ark. Apr. 30, 2019), aff\u2019d, 957 F.3d 869 (8th Cir. 2020); \nLawrence Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. McDaniel, 2018 WL 1569484, at \n*5-6 (E.D. Ark. Mar. 30, 2018); McMinn v.

June 2, 2016). \n\n42 \n \n \nAnother example is D.A. v. Houston Independent \nSchool District, 716 F. Supp. 2d 603 (S.D. Tex. 2009), \nwhich involved school officials\u2019 years-long \u201cfailure to \ntest\u201d a young child for learning disabilities\u2014even \nthough he \u201cwas the lowest performing child\u201d in the \nfirst grade and had exhibited \u201c\u2018extreme behavior,\u201d \nsuch as \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201chav[ing] outbursts.\u201d  Id. at \n606-07.  School officials also ignored an independent \nexpert who warned\u2014in writing\u2014that the child was \n\u201cin desperate need of intervention.\u201d  Id. at 608.  And \nthe child reported \u201cbeing dragged around,\u201d \u201cput in a \ncloset,\u201d and called \u201ca lazy monkey\u201d by school staff.  Id.  \nNevertheless, the district court denied relief under \nMonahan, id. at 620, in a decision that the Fifth \nCircuit unanimously affirmed, D.A. ex rel. Latasha A. \nv. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 629 F.3d 450, 454-55 \n(5th Cir. 2010). \nOr take I.A. v. Seguin Independent School District, \n881 F. Supp. 2d 770 (W.D. Tex. 2012), where a school \nrepeatedly excluded a paralyzed student from \nextracurricular \nactivities\u2014including \nfield \ntrips, \nswimming classes, and band concerts\u2014despite \nobvious and readily available accommodations for his \ndisability.  See id. at 774-75.  The school also failed to \nprovide \nsuitable \n\u201cdesks\u201d \nand \n\u201can \naccessible \nbathroom,\u201d while failing to fix \u201cdangerous\u201d walkways \nto various facilities, despite the child falling multiple \ntimes.  Id. at 778.  There too, the court rejected the \nstudent\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims under \nMonahan, reasoning that \u201c[a]lthough mistakes may \nhave been made, they d[id] not rise to the level of bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 784.   \nThese cases confirm that the \u201cadditional element\u201d \nimposed by Monahan is \u201cimpossibl[e]\u201d to satisfy \u201cfor \nmany plaintiffs.\u201d  Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002.  Congress \n\n43 \n \n \ndid not enact that unduly harsh regime, which \nsenselessly disadvantages some of society\u2019s most \nvulnerable members.   \n3.  Monahan\u2019s asymmetric rule also leads to \narbitrary and anomalous results.   It requires pre-K, \nelementary, middle, and high school students suing \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to prove bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. \nRosemount- Apple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d \n966, 968, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017).  But college students \nbringing the exact same claims do not have to clear \nthat hurdle, even in circuits that apply Monahan\u2019s \nheightened standard.  See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake \nForest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461-62 \n(4th Cir. 2012); Mershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d \n1069, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2006); Gati v. W. Kentucky \nUniv., 762 F. App\u2019x 246, 250 (6th Cir. 2019).  Why \nshould a graduation ceremony drastically alter the \nstandard for demonstrating disability discrimination \nin the educational context?  Monahan doesn\u2019t say.   \nThe District asserts that this head-scratching \nregime was actually part of Congress\u2019s design because \n\u201ccollege students,\u201d unlike \u201celementary and secondary \nstudents, \u201care not covered by the IDEA.\u201d  BIO31 n.3.  \nBut again, Congress has made clear\u2014in unequivocal \nstatutory text\u2014that potential overlap with the IDEA \ndoes not \u201crestrict\u201d or \u201climit\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s protections.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); \nsee supra at 30-34.  Plus, courts apply Monahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard even in \ncases where school-age children with disabilities are \nbringing claims that do not involve the denial of a \nFAPE\u2014and thus lack any nexus with the IDEA.  \nSee, e.g., Baker v. Bentonville Sch. Dist., 75 F.4th 810, \n815-16 (8th Cir. 2023) (safety hazards at school for \n\n44 \n \n \nvisually impaired child); Hoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 283, 103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th \nCir. 1996) (elevator access at school for physically \nimpaired child).   \nRequiring school-age children with disabilities \nwho suffer education-related discrimination to satisfy \na more stringent standard than college students who \nendured the same mistreatment makes no sense.  Yet \nthat unsound result flows directly from Monahan. \nE. Monahan \nRested \nOn \nFlawed \nPolicy \nAnalysis, Not Law \nAt its core, Monahan is a textbook example of \nlegislating from the bench.  The Eighth Circuit \nadmitted that it sought to achieve \u201cwhat we\u201d\u2014judges, \nnot legislators\u2014\u201cbelieve to be a proper balance \nbetween the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171 (emphasis added).   \nMonahan was wrong to \u201creplace the actual text\u201d of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act with judicial \n\u201cspeculation as to Congress\u2019 intent\u201d on matters of \npolicy.  Perez, 598 U.S. at 150.  It was especially wrong \nto do so in a case where the parties\u2019 briefs did not \naddress the proper standard for Rehabilitation Act \nclaims in the school setting\u2014let alone propose a \nbrand new \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d test.9  \nAnd even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s speculation \nabout Congress\u2019s intent makes little sense. \n \n9  The Monahan briefs are available at the National \nArchives in Kansas City, and can be provided to the Court by \nAva\u2019s counsel upon request.  \n\n45 \n \n \n1.  Judges ordinarily do not claim broad authority \nto invent bespoke legal standards for federal statutes \nbased on pure policy grounds.  In Monahan, the \nEighth Circuit offered no persuasive basis for \nclaiming that policymaking authority.      \nThe District has now tried to fill in the gap.  In its \nbrief opposing certiorari, the District argued that \nbecause the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s private \nrights of action are \u201cjudicially implied,\u201d courts have \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial \nscheme.\u201d  BIO26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  \nThis post hoc defense of Monahan\u2019s self-described \npolicymaking does not withstand scrutiny. \nFor starters, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprivate rights of action are not implied.  Rather, the \nstatutes \u201cexpressly incorporate[]\u201d the preexisting \nright of action under Title VI, which was originally \njudicially implied and later congressionally ratified.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 \nU.S.C \u00a7 12133.  So whatever \u201cmeasure of latitude\u201d \ncourts might have to tinker with an implied private \nright of action is irrelevant.  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284. \nRegardless, any such latitude is sharply limited.  \nCourts can only shape an implied right of action in the \nway that \u201cbest comports with the statute.\u201d  Id.  But \nhere, as explained, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \n\u201cgeneral language\u201d served to \u201cproduce general \ncoverage\u201d for all people with disabilities\u2014and does \nnot \u201cleave room for courts to recognize ad hoc \nexceptions\u201d for school-age children or anyone else.  \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 101 (2012); see supra \nat 24-30.  Indeed, the District has not mustered a \nsingle decision from this Court authorizing disfavored \n\n46 \n \n \ntreatment of different classes of plaintiffs asserting \nthe same private right of action, implied or otherwise.  \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial overreaching\u201d is clear as day.  \nDrew Millar, Judicially Reducing the Standard of \nCare: \nAn \nAnalysis \nof \nthe \nBad \nFaith/Gross \nMisjudgment \nStandard \nin \nSpecial \nEducation \nDiscrimination, 96 Ky. L.J. 711, 728-29 (2008). \n \n2.  Even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s atextual \nappeal to policy does not hold up.  Monahan doubted \n\u201cthe competence of courts to make judgments\u201d about \ndecisions by \u201ceducational officials\u201d in this \u201ctechnical \nfield[].\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  But the IDEA demands \ninquiry into the \u201cadequacy of a given\u201d child\u2019s \neducation\u2014and thus judicial examination of the \n\u201cdecisions\u201d made by educational officials, with \nappropriate respect for the \u201cexpertise and the exercise \nof judgment by school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel.  \nJoseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386, 404 (2017).  Such respectful consideration of \nschools\u2019 decisionmaking is equally proper under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nMore fundamentally, just last Term this Court \nresoundingly rejected the notion, echoed in Monahan, \nthat some matters are simply too \u201ctechnical\u201d for \ncourts to review independently.  Loper Bright Enters. \nv. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 402 (2024).  Federal courts \nare surely capable of showing due respect for \neducational officials\u2019 experience and expertise while \nadjudicating discrimination claims in the school \nsetting\u2014just as they do in any other context.  It is a \nmistake to distort statutory text out of a misplaced \nfear that courts cannot responsibly decide cases \n\n47 \n \n \nimplicating sensitive or technical matters.  The ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act are no exception.10 \n3.  Rather than focus on policy, this Court should \napply the law.  In recent years, the Court has \nrepeatedly enforced the plain text of federal \ncivil-rights \nstatutes \nprotecting \nvulnerable \npopulations\u2014including children with disabilities\u2014\nfrom discrimination.  See, e.g., Perez, 598 U.S. at \n146-47; Fry, 580 U.S. at 158; Endrew F., 580 U.S. at \n399; see also Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. \n346, 355 (2024); Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468-70 \n(2023); Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 402 (2020); \nMount Lemmon Fire Dist. v. Guido, 586 U.S. 1, 6-8 \n(2018).  These decisions vindicate textualism as a \nmethod of statutory interpretation that is \u201cneutral as \na matter of politics and policy.\u201d  Brett M. Kavanaugh, \nFixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. \n2118, 2135 (2016).   \n \nThis Court should embrace that same textualist \napproach here.  Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard flunks every test of text, \nhistory, purpose, and policy.  This Court should now \nfix Monahan\u2019s error.  It should enforce the plain \nmeaning of the Nation\u2019s anti-discrimination laws and \nrestore the full protections Congress granted children \nwith disabilities. \n \n10  It would likewise be mistaken to distort the statutory \ntext out of fear that plaintiffs might try to \u201cend-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school districts\u2019 \nfacilitation of the IDEA.\u201d  BIO28.  The IDEA already addresses \npotential evasion:  It \u201cdemand[s]\u201d exhaustion of the IEP process \n\u201cwhen a plaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA can supply,\u201d like a \nFAPE-related injunction\u2014while \u201cexcusing exhaustion when a \nplaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA cannot provide,\u201d like damages.  \nPerez, 598 U.S. at 150. \n\n48 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be vacated \nand the case remanded for further proceedings. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nNICHOLAS ROSELLINI \nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP \n505 Montgomery Street \nSuite 2000 \nSan Francisco, CA 94111 \n \nAMY J.

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs are preserved, but this observation adds a crucial layer of insight into the Respondent's legal strategy. The search for the Respondent's Brief on the Merits was unsuccessful; instead, it returned the Respondent's **Brief in Opposition (BIO)** to the petition for certiorari. While this is not the final merits brief I was anticipating, it provides a detailed preview of the arguments Lisa Blatt and her team deployed to try and prevent the Court from taking the case. The failure of these arguments is as informative as the arguments themselves.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important (Belief Strengthened):** My prior belief is significantly reinforced. The BIO reveals that the Respondent, Osseo Area Schools, argued forcefully that there was \"no meaningful circuit split\" and that this case was a \"poor vehicle.\" The Supreme Court's decision to grant certiorari *despite* these arguments from a highly respected Supreme Court advocate demonstrates that at least four Justices were wholly unpersuaded. They clearly see a genuine, outcome-determinative conflict over the legal standard that requires their intervention, and they are not deterred by case-specific vehicle problems.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument Remains a Forceful Textualist Challenge:** My understanding of the Petitioner's core argument\u2014that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is an atextual judicial invention that conflicts with the ADA/Rehab Act's plain language and the IDEA's savings clause\u2014remains the central pillar of my analysis. This argument is well-aligned with the Court's recent jurisprudence (*Perez*, *Groff*, *Muldrow*).\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Strategy is Previewed and Tested:** The BIO provides the first look at the Respondent's defense of the heightened *Monahan* standard. Their strategy, which failed at the cert stage, is built on three pillars:\n    *   **Minimizing the Circuit Split:** The BIO claims the different standards are mere \"different verbal formulations\" and that all circuits agree on a high bar for intent. The Court's cert grant is a direct rejection of this premise.\n    *   **Arguing for Judicial Deference:** The core substantive argument is that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is a necessary, judicially-crafted rule to manage the \"conceptual peculiarity\" of IDEA-related discrimination claims. They argue it correctly balances the ADA's anti-discrimination mandate with the need for deference to the professional judgment of educators, citing *Endrew F.* for the principle that courts should not substitute their own educational policy notions. This frames the issue not as one of statutory text, but of prudential court-made doctrine to manage overlapping statutes.\n    *   **Framing the Case as Fact-Bound:** The BIO argues that under *any* standard, the District's actions\u2014providing numerous accommodations and engaging in the IEP process\u2014do not rise to the level of discriminatory intent. This was an attempt to frame the case as a poor vehicle, an argument the Court also rejected.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict is Textualism vs. Prudentialism:** The BIO solidifies my understanding of the case's central legal battle. The Petitioner is advancing a purely textualist and structural argument: the statutes don't contain this heightened standard, so it cannot be applied. The Respondent is advancing a prudential and structural argument: this heightened standard is a necessary judicial gloss to make the statutory scheme work in the unique context of education, preventing the ADA from swallowing the IDEA's detailed procedural framework. The fact that the Court took the case suggests a strong appetite to resolve this conflict in favor of the text, but the Respondent's final merits brief will show how they re-tool these prudential arguments to appeal to a majority. My confidence in a potential victory for the Petitioner has increased, as the Respondent's initial line of defense has already been implicitly rejected by the Court. The most critical missing evidence remains the Respondent's Brief on the Merits, which will reveal how they adapt their failed cert-stage arguments for the merits.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs are preserved. The search for the Petitioner's Reply Brief was unsuccessful, but it located a far more foundational document: the **Petitioner's Brief on the Merits**. This brief, filed by Roman Martinez, provides the complete and official articulation of the Petitioner's legal arguments, moving my understanding from inference based on the cert petition to direct knowledge from the primary filing.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important (Belief Stable):** This belief remains unchanged. The Court's decision to take the case over the Respondent's objections in the BIO continues to signal that a majority of the Court sees a significant, outcome-determinative circuit split that requires resolution.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Massively Strengthened and Detailed):** My prior understanding of the Petitioner's argument is now confirmed and fleshed out with the specific legal architecture from their brief. The argument is not just a simple textual complaint; it is a comprehensive attack on the legitimacy of the *Monahan* \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. The core arguments are:\n    *   **Uniform Statutory Text:** The brief's primary argument is that the text of the ADA (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132) and Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)) is universal, prohibiting discrimination against \"any person.\" There is no textual basis for creating a special, more stringent standard exclusively for children with disabilities in educational settings. It powerfully invokes the canon of construction from *Clark v. Martinez* that a single statutory text cannot have different meanings for different plaintiffs.\n    *   **Violation of the IDEA Savings Clause:** The brief argues that the *Monahan* standard directly contravenes Congress's intent expressed in the IDEA's savings clause (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l)). That clause explicitly preserves remedies available under other federal laws (like the ADA). By imposing a higher bar to relief, the *Monahan* rule diminishes, rather than preserves, those remedies, thwarting a clear congressional command.\n    *   **Undermining Statutory Purpose:** The argument is made that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act were specifically designed to combat discrimination born of \"thoughtlessness and indifference,\" not just \"invidious animus\" (*Alexander v. Choate*). The \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard improperly narrows the statutes' scope to only the most egregious conduct, ignoring the very type of neglectful discrimination Congress sought to remedy.\n    *   **Unfair and Arbitrary Results:** The brief highlights the asymmetry created by *Monahan*, where a student suing a university faces a lower bar than a K-12 student suing their school district under the exact same statutory provisions. This creates arbitrary and unfair outcomes based solely on the plaintiff's age and context.\n    *   **Flawed Judicial Rationale:** The brief directly attacks the origin of the *Monahan* standard, labeling it \"flawed policy analysis, not law.\" It contends the standard was not derived from statutory interpretation but from a court's misguided policy speculation about the need for deference to educators\u2014a deference not commanded by the text of the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Strategy is Preemptively Countered (Belief Stable):** My understanding of the Respondent's likely defense\u2014based on their BIO\u2014is that the *Monahan* standard is a necessary prudential rule to manage the overlap between the IDEA and ADA and to give deference to educators. The Petitioner's brief is engineered to dismantle this defense before it is even formally made on the merits. By framing the *Monahan* rule as an illegitimate \"judicial gloss\" and \"atextual invention,\" the Petitioner's brief recasts the Respondent's prudential arguments as a call for the Court to uphold a policy preference over clear statutory text.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: Statutory Text vs. Atextual Judicial Invention (Belief Refined and Sharpened):** The conflict is now clearer than ever. It is not a mere disagreement over two plausible interpretations. The Petitioner has framed the case as a choice between enforcing the plain text of statutes passed by Congress versus upholding a 40-year-old, atextual standard invented by a lower court. The brief's heavy reliance on recent textualist decisions from the Court (*Perez*, *Groff*, *Muldrow*) signals a clear strategy to appeal to the current majority's preferred interpretive methodology. My confidence in a likely victory for the Petitioner has increased significantly, as their argument appears tailor-made for this Court. The most critical missing piece of evidence remains the Respondent's Brief on the Merits, which must now defend the *Monahan* standard against this powerful and focused textualist and structural attack.",

The potential for this observation to significantly shift my posterior belief about the case outcome is maximal, hence the Task EIG of 1.0. The observation will either confirm that the Respondent's case is weak (sharpening my belief in a reversal) or present unexpectedly strong counter-arguments (forcing a major revision of my prediction). The Design EIG is also high because this provides a perfect test case for quantifying the impact of counter-arguments and modeling a common legal conflict: a textualist challenge to a long-standing, atextual judicial standard.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal `THINK` action, a reflection on my current knowledge state and a plan for future information gathering. It did not introduce new external evidence about the case. Therefore, my substantive beliefs about the legal arguments and likely outcome remain stable, but the observation reinforces the current limitations of my analysis and highlights the most critical missing piece of evidence.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important (Belief Stable):** This foundational belief is unchanged. The Court's decision to take the case, despite the Respondent's arguments in their Brief in Opposition, continues to be the strongest signal that a majority of justices believe there is a consequential circuit split that warrants a definitive ruling.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Confirmed):** My analysis of the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits provides a complete and robust understanding of their legal strategy. This belief is stable and detailed:\n    *   **Textual Primacy:** The core argument is that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act prohibit discrimination against \"any person,\" with no textual exception for K-12 education. The Petitioner argues that creating a special, higher \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard for students violates the principle that a single statutory text cannot have different meanings for different classes of plaintiffs (*Clark v. Martinez*).\n    *   **Statutory Conflict:** The brief argues the *Monahan* standard functionally negates the IDEA's savings clause (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l)), which explicitly preserves remedies under other federal laws like the ADA. By making it harder to get relief, the judicial standard diminishes a right Congress expressly saved.\n    *   **Purpose and Precedent:** The argument leverages precedent like *Alexander v. Choate* to assert that the anti-discrimination statutes were meant to address \"thoughtlessness and indifference,\" not just intentional malice. The *Monahan* standard improperly narrows the statutes to only the most egregious conduct.\n    *   **Judicial Overreach:** The Petitioner frames the *Monahan* standard as an \"atextual invention\" rooted in \"flawed policy analysis\" by a lower court, not in statutory interpretation. This framing is a direct appeal to the current Court's skepticism of judicially created rules that lack a clear textual basis.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Strategy is Preemptively Countered (Belief Stable):** Based on the BIO, the Respondent is expected to argue that the *Monahan* standard is a necessary prudential rule for managing the IDEA/ADA overlap and deferring to educators. The Petitioner's brief is strategically designed to portray these arguments as a request for the Court to favor atextual policy preferences over clear congressional text.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: Statutory Text vs. Atextual Judicial Invention (Belief Sharpened and Stable):** The case is now clearly defined as a choice between enforcing the plain text of the ADA/Rehabilitation Act versus upholding a 40-year-old, judicially-created standard. The Petitioner's heavy reliance on textualism and recent Court precedents (*Perez*, *Groff*, *Muldrow*) makes their argument appear exceptionally well-suited for the current Court's majority.\n\n5.  **Analysis is Provisionally One-Sided (New Meta-Belief):** The `THINK` observation formalizes a crucial aspect of my current belief state: my analysis is based almost exclusively on the Petitioner's side of the argument. While their brief is powerful and appears likely to succeed, this conclusion is provisional. My confidence is high but brittle, as it has not yet been tested against the Respondent's counter-arguments on the merits. The most significant uncertainty in my predictive model is how Osseo Area Schools will defend the *Monahan* standard. Their brief is the single most important piece of evidence I need to acquire to form a balanced and durable prediction.",

The Solicitor General's (SG) view is one of the most influential inputs for the Supreme Court, especially in cases of statutory interpretation where the executive branch has enforcement authority (like the ADA). My current analysis is balanced on a knife's edge between the Petitioner's strong textualist argument and the Respondent's defense of a judicially-created prudential standard. The SG's position will provide a powerful thumb on the scale.\n\n1.  **Task EIG (0.9):** Finding the US brief would resolve a massive uncertainty. If the US supports the Petitioner, it powerfully validates the textualist argument and makes a reversal highly likely. If the US supports the Respondent, it would give significant weight to the pragmatic/structural defense of the 'bad faith' standard, forcing a major re-evaluation of my prediction and suggesting the case is much closer than I currently believe. A mixed position would introduce a potential third outcome. Any of these results would drastically shift my posterior belief about the case outcome, making this action far more valuable than searching for less influential amicus briefs.\n\n2.  **Design EIG (0.8):** This action tests a core principle of SCOTUS prediction: the weight of the Solicitor General's opinion. Observing how the Court interacts with the SG's arguments\u2014especially if the SG's reasoning deviates from pure textualism\u2014will provide crucial data for my general model. It will help refine my understanding of the current Court's hierarchy of judicial philosophies (e.g., how does textualism weigh against the executive's expert view on statutory administration?). This is a classic, high-leverage move that improves the generalizability of my prediction strategy.",

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citation \nomitted); see id. at 24a-25a.  The court applied that \nstandard and concluded that respondents \u201cdid not act \nwith bad faith or gross misjudgment when making edu-\ncational decisions regarding\u201d petitioner.  Id. at 7a; see \nid. at 25a-36a.   \nb. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-5a.  \nThe court explained that, under Eighth Circuit prece-\ndent, when \u201calleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \n\u2018based on educational services for disabled children,\u2019  \n* * *  a plaintiff must prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d in order \nto establish the defendants\u2019 \u201cliability.\u201d  Id. at 3a (cita-\ntions omitted).  The court concluded that, although pe-\ntitioner \u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether [respondents were] negligent or even deliber-\nately indifferent,\u201d she had failed to provide sufficient \nevidence of \u201c\u200a\u2018bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d to with-\nstand respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 3a-5a.  The court made clear \nthat it viewed the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard as significantly more demanding than the in-\ntent standard that applies to non-school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims.  See id. at 5a n.2 (noting that  \nthe court \u201crequire[s] much less in other disability- \ndiscrimination contexts\u201d). \nAlthough the court of appeals applied the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as a matter of circuit \nprecedent, the court questioned the legal basis for that \nstandard.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  The court explained that \nthe standard had originated in Monahan v.

App. 5a n.2.  The court further noted that, although \nCongress had later \u201crejected Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d by \nenacting Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment rule\u201d had continued to \u201cspread like wild-\nfire.\u201d  Ibid.  The court accordingly viewed the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as offering \u201ca lesson in \n\u2018why we do not  . . .  add provisions to  . . .  federal stat-\nutes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (brackets and citation omitted).   \nc. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc, \nwith Judges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes noting that they \nwould have granted the petition for en banc rehearing.  \nPet. App. 44a-45a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA.  1.  To establish a violation of Title II of the ADA \nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff need \nonly prove that she was an individual with a disability \nwho was discriminated against by reason of her disabil-\nity.  Those showings can be made without proof that the \ndefendant intended to discriminate.  Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 are framed in the passive voice and do not sug-\ngest that an actor\u2019s bad intent is an element of a statu-\ntory violation.  Accordingly, a plaintiff may obtain in-\njunctive relief under Title II or Section 504 without \nproving intent to discriminate, as long as the other re-\nquirements for injunctive relief are satisfied.   \n2.  To obtain compensatory damages under Title II \nor Section 504, however, a plaintiff must prove inten-\ntional discrimination; to do so, she must at a minimum \nprove deliberate indifference.  Both the intent require-\n\n11 \n \nment and the deliberate-indifference standard are drawn \nfrom this Court\u2019s decisions interpreting similar stat-\nutes.  And the deliberate-indifference standard\u2014which \nrequires proof that a covered entity failed to act despite \nits actual knowledge that a federally protected right \nwas substantially likely to be violated\u2014ensures that \nschools will not incur damages liability on account of \nmistakes, negligence, or bureaucratic inaction.  That \nstandard also appropriately balances the relevant con-\nsiderations that this Court has identified:  It ensures \nthat regulated entities will have notice before they are \nheld liable for damages, and it gives them the necessary \nflexibility to implement their programs, while also sup-\nporting the ADA\u2019s and the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s goals of \nassuring that people with disabilities have equal oppor-\ntunities and are fully integrated into society.   \nB.  1.  Some courts have applied a heightened intent \nstandard\u2014\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d\u2014to Title \nII and Section 504 claims that arise in the context of el-\nementary or secondary education.  The Court should re-\nject that approach.  Because the texts of Title II and \nSection 504 do not distinguish between school and non-\nschool settings, there is no sound basis for that idiosyn-\ncratic heightened standard. \n2.  The statutory context reinforces that conclusion.  \nFor these purposes, the only potentially salient distinc-\ntion between school and non-school settings is that the \nschool setting is also subject to the IDEA.  But impos-\ning a heightened intent requirement on that basis would \ncontravene Congress\u2019s directive that the IDEA should \nnot be read to \u201crestrict or limit  * * *  the remedies \navailable under\u201d the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  Indeed, Congress enacted Section \n1415(l) in order to overturn a decision of this Court that \n\n12 \n \nhad read the IDEA to preclude application of Section \n504 in the context of elementary and secondary educa-\ntion.  A heightened intent requirement would also dis-\nserve the purposes of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct, which broadly seek to end disability discrimination \nthroughout society, including in elementary and sec-\nondary schools. \n3.  Like other courts that have adopted the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard, the Eighth Circuit be-\nlow has identified no sound basis for that standard.  Ra-\nther, the standard originated in dictum that was wrong \nwhen it was first articulated and has been further dis-\ncredited by Congress\u2019s intervening enactment of Sec-\ntion 1415(l).  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise have no \nbasis in the statutory text or context, and the policy con-\ncerns that respondents invoke are overstated. \nARGUMENT \nA. Proof Of Discriminatory Intent Is Not Required To \nDemonstrate A Violation Of Title II Or Section 504, But \nSuch Proof Is Required To Recover Damages Under \nThose Provisions \nUnder Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Re-\nhabilitation Act, plaintiffs may bring suit seeking \u201cmoney \ndamages\u201d and \u201cinjunctive relief.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Com-\nmunity Sch., 580 U.S. 154, 160 (2017).  Well-established \nlegal standards govern those claims.  To demonstrate a \nviolation of Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff need not \nprove that the defendant intended to engage in disabil-\nity discrimination.  And a plaintiff need not make a show-\ning of discriminatory intent in order to obtain injunctive \nor other equitable relief under those statutes.  But a \nplaintiff seeking compensatory damages must prove in-\ntentional discrimination; she may make that showing by \nproving deliberate indifference.  As discussed below in \n\n13 \n \nPart B, those standards also apply in the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education.   \n1. To establish a violation of Title II or Section 504, a \nplaintiff need not prove that the defendant intended \nto engage in disability discrimination \nBy its plain terms, Section 504 protects a covered in-\ndividual from specified outcomes\u2014\u201cbe[ing] excluded\u201d \nfrom participation, \u201cbe[ing] denied\u201d benefits, or \u201cbe[ing] \nsubjected to\u201d discrimination\u2014when the adverse effect \noccurs \u201csolely by reason of,\u201d i.e., has a sufficient causal \nlink to, that individual\u2019s disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a); cf. \nHemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 9 (2010).  \nSection 504 is written in the \u201cpassive voice,\u201d \u201cfocus[ing] \non an event that occurs without respect to a specific ac-\ntor, and therefore without respect to any actor\u2019s intent \nor culpability.\u201d  Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. 568, 572 \n(2009).  \u201cCongress\u2019 use of the passive voice\u201d \u201cindicates \nthat [Section 504] does not require proof of intent.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThis Court has also observed that, when Congress \nenacted the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, \u201c[d]iscrimina-\ntion against the handicapped was perceived by Con-\ngress to be most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014of \nbenign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985).  For that reason, \u201cmuch of the conduct that Con-\ngress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act \nwould be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act \nconstrued to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discrim-\ninatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 296-297.  The same is true of the \nkey provision of Title II of the ADA, which was modeled \non Section 504 and is also in the passive voice.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 12132 (\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from par-\n\n14 \n \nticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjec-\nted to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d).  A height-\nened intent standard for establishing liability would \nalso undermine the congressional objectives articulated \nin the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act:  maximizing the \n\u201cinclusion and integration\u201d into \u201csociety\u201d of individuals \nwith disabilities, 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F), and \u201cassur[ing] \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency\u201d for persons with \ndisabilities, 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7).  See pp. 25-26, infra \n(discussing the purposes of those statutes in more de-\ntail); see also S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d \n248, 264 (3d Cir. 2013). \nAs a general matter, the courts of appeals have \nagreed that a plaintiff need not prove intent to discrim-\ninate in order to establish a violation of Title II or Sec-\ntion 504.  See, e.g., Ruskai v. Pistole, 775 F.3d 61, 78 (1st \nCir. 2014); but see Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of \nTenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 235, 241 (6th Cir. 2019).  Thus, they \nhave described proof of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d (an in-\ntent showing, see pp. 15-18, infra) as \u201can additional hur-\ndle\u201d that under Title II and Section 504 applies only  \nto claims for \u201cdamages.\u201d  Silberman v. Miami Dade \nTransit, 927 F.3d 1123, 1134 (11th Cir. 2019).  The courts \nof appeals have also explained that \u201cequitable remedies \nfor violations of the ADA\u201d\u2014including \u201cinjunction[s] man-\ndating compliance with its provisions\u201d\u2014\u201care available \nregardless of a defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d  Midgett v. Tri-\nCounty Metro. Transp. Dist., 254 F.3d 846, 851 (9th Cir. \n2001); see Hall v. Higgins, 77 F.4th 1171, 1180-1181 (8th \nCir. 2023) (indicating that the need to show deliberate \nindifference applies only to damages claims); D.E. v. \nCentral Dauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 269 (3d Cir. \n\n15 \n \n2014) (similar); Mark H. v. Hamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090, \n1097 (9th Cir. 2010) (similar). \n2. To obtain compensatory damages for Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 violations, a plaintiff must prove intentional \ndiscrimination, which may be shown by proving de-\nliberate indifference  \nA private plaintiff seeking money damages for a vio-\nlation of Title II or Section 504 must prove that the de-\nfendant engaged in intentional discrimination.  A plain-\ntiff may prove that discriminatory intent by demon-\nstrating that the defendant acted with deliberate indif-\nference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s federally protected rights\u2014a \nstandard that is properly understood to require a show-\ning considerably higher than negligence. \na. To demonstrate an entitlement to compensatory \ndamages under Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff must \nprove that the covered entity intentionally discriminated \nagainst the plaintiff.  Petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 7) \nthat \u201cpeople with disabilities may not obtain damages \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act without proving \nintent.\u201d  And the courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that, \u201c[t]o recover monetary damages under Ti-\ntle II of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff \nmust prove intentional discrimination on the part of the \ndefendant.\u201d  Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, \n1138 (9th Cir. 2001) (footnote omitted); see, e.g., S.H., \n729 F.3d at 260-262; Liese v. Indian River County \nHosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 344 (11th Cir. 2012); Meagley \nv. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011); \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009); Barber v. Colorado Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 562 \nF.3d 1222, 1228 (10th Cir. 2009). \nA discriminatory-intent requirement for damages \nclaims under Title II and Section 504 is consistent with \n\n16 \n \nthis Court\u2019s decisions interpreting Title IX of the Edu-\ncation Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. \n373-375.  Title IX\u2019s prohibition on discrimination is sim-\nilar to that in the Rehabilitation Act, although Title IX \naddresses sex discrimination in federally funded educa-\ntional programs and activities, while the Rehabilitation \nAct addresses disability discrimination in all programs \nand activities conducted by recipients of federal funds.  \nCompare 20 U.S.C. 1681(a), with 29 U.S.C. 794(a).  \u201cWhen \nCongress attaches conditions to the award of federal \nfunds under its spending power,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] \nclosely the propriety of private actions holding the re-\ncipient liable in monetary damages for noncompliance \nwith the condition.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. \nDist., 524 U.S. 274, 287 (1998).  The Court in Gebser con-\ncluded that, while equitable relief might be appropriate \nto undo the effects of unintentional Title IX violations \nand prevent such violations from recurring, only inten-\ntional violators are subject to damages liability.  See id. \nat 287-291; Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 74-75 (1992).  The same approach is appropriate \nunder Title II and Section 504.   \nb. To prove intent to discriminate, a Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 plaintiff needs to show that an entity acted with \nat least deliberate indifference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s feder-\nally protected rights.  That standard is grounded in this \nCourt\u2019s decisions in Gebser, supra, and Davis v. Monroe \nCounty Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), and in \nthe similarities between those statutes and Title IX.  \nAnd outside the educational context, courts of appeals \nhave generally concluded that a plaintiff can prove in-\ntentional discrimination by demonstrating deliberate \nindifference on the part of a covered entity.  See, e.g., \nS.H., 729 F.3d at 262-265; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344-351; \n\n17 \n \nMeagley, 639 F.3d at 389-390; Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275; \nBarber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229; Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1138-\n1139.1 \nIn Gebser, the Court considered the circumstances in \nwhich an educational institution receiving federal funds \nmay be held liable for damages under Title IX for sexual \nharassment of a student by a teacher.  524 U.S. at 277.  \nThe Court concluded that damages could be recovered \nin such a case only when \u201can official who at a minimum \nhas authority to address the alleged discrimination and \nto institute corrective measures on the recipient\u2019s be-\nhalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recip-\nient\u2019s programs\u201d and responds with \u201cdeliberate indif-\nference to [the] discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 290.  In adopting \nthe deliberate-indifference standard, the Court ex-\nplained that Title IX \u201cattaches conditions to the award \nof federal funds,\u201d and that a federal funding recipient \ngenerally should have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that it will be liable for a \nmonetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 287 (citation omitted).  The \nCourt also noted that Title IX\u2019s express remedial scheme, \nwhich allows termination of federal funding by the gov-\nernment, is predicated on notice and an opportunity for \nthe recipient to rectify a violation.  Id. at 289.  The Court \naccordingly found that Congress did not intend to sub-\nject a recipient of federal funding to damages liability \n \n1 Proof of discriminatory intent does not require evidence of dis-\ncriminatory animus.  The courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that the deliberate-indifference standard \u201cdoes not require a \nshowing of personal ill will or animosity toward the disabled person; \nrather, \u2018intentional discrimination can be inferred from a defend-\nant\u2019s deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of \nits questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally \nprotected rights.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Barber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229 (citation omitted); \nsee, e.g., S.H., 729 F.3d at 263; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Loeffler, 582 \nF.3d at 275. \n\n18 \n \nin a private Title IX action when the recipient \u201cwas un-\naware of discrimination in its programs and is willing to \ninstitute prompt corrective measures.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn Davis, the Court extended Gebser to claims alleg-\ning \u201cstudent-on-student harassment,\u201d holding that dam-\nages can be awarded against a school board under Title \nIX \u201cwhere the funding recipient acts with deliberate in-\ndifference to known acts of harassment in its programs \nor activities.\u201d  Davis, 526 U.S. at 633.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court emphasized that deliberate indif-\nference is a \u201chigh standard\u201d that allows \u201c[s]chool admin-\nistrators [to] continue to enjoy the flexibility they re-\nquire\u201d because a plaintiff must prove \u201cactual knowledge\u201d \nof discrimination and \u201c\u200a\u2018an official decision by the recip-\nient not to remedy the violation.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 642-643, 648 \n(citation omitted). \nGebser\u2019s rationales for adopting the deliberate- \nindifference standard apply with full force to damages \nclaims under Section 504.  See Liese, 701 F.3d at 348 \n(\u201cBecause of the similarities between Title IX and the \n[Rehabilitation Act], Gebser\u2019s  * * *  reasoning applies \nwith similar force to the [Rehabilitation Act] and yields \nthe same result.\u201d).  And while the ADA is not a Spend-\ning Clause statute, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1, Title \nII\u2019s incorporation of Section 504\u2019s remedies suggests \nthat the same rationales apply to Title II claims.2   \n \n2 Entry of an injunction ordering a covered entity to comply with \nits legal obligations under Title II or Section 504 does not raise the \nsame concerns that motivated the Court to adopt the deliberate- \nindifference standard for the private damages claims at issue in \nGebser and Davis.  Unlike damages, equitable relief does not impli-\ncate the Court\u2019s \u201ccentral concern\u201d when interpreting Spending \nClause statutes:  \u201cthat \u2018the receiving entity of federal funds has no-\ntice that it will be liable for a monetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 287 (brackets and citation omitted).  And unlike damages liability \n\n19 \n \nc. The deliberate-indifference intent requirement is \n\u201can exacting standard,\u201d J.S. v. Houston County Bd. of \nEduc., 877 F.3d 979, 987 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) \n(citation omitted), that ensures that entities cannot be \nheld liable for damages on account of mistakes, negli-\ngence, or bureaucratic inaction.  Similar to the analysis \nthis Court applied in Gebser and Davis, courts analyz-\ning Title II and Section 504 damages claims must ask \nwhether the evidence proves that the covered entity both \n\u201c(1) [had] knowledge that a federally protected right is \nsubstantially likely to be violated  * * *  and (2) fail[ed] \nto act despite that knowledge.\u201d  S.H., 729 F.3d at 265; \nsee Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229.  Ap-\nplication of the deliberate-indifference standard to Title \nII and Section 504 damages claims accordingly ensures \nthat regulated entities will have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that [they] will \nbe liable for a monetary award,\u2019\u200a\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 \n(citation omitted), and provides them with the neces-\nsary \u201cflexibility\u201d to implement their programs without \nfear of unexpected damages liability, Davis, 526 U.S. at \n648.   \nThe knowledge requirement demands \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d of the substantial likelihood of discrimination, \nGebser, 524 U.S. at 290, and does not generally allow \nimposition of damages liability based on what the de-\nfendant \u201cshould have known,\u201d Davis, 526 U.S. at 642.  \nSee, e.g., J.S., 877 F.3d at 989 (applying an \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d standard); Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (same).  And \nthe failure-to-act requirement requires proof of \u201ca  \n\u2018deliberate choice, rather than negligence or bureau-\ncratic inaction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (citation omit-\n \nfor past violations, a recipient of federal funds can avoid equitable \nrelief under the Rehabilitation Act by withdrawing from the federal \nfunding program.   \n\n20 \n \nted); see Liese, 701 F.3d at 344 (\u201c[D]eliberate indiffer-\nence plainly requires more than gross negligence.\u201d); \nJ.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 813 F.3d 1289, 1298 (10th \nCir. 2016) (\u201cThe failure to act must be \u2018more than negli-\ngent\u2019 and involve \u2018an element of deliberateness.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229 (similar);  \n1 Americans with Disabilities: Practice and Compli-\nance Manual \u00a7\u00a7 1:261, 2:222 (2d ed. 2024).  \u201c[D]eliber-\nate indifference does not occur where a duty to act may \nsimply have been overlooked, or a complaint may rea-\nsonably have been deemed to result from events taking \ntheir normal course\u201d; in other words, \u201cbureaucratic \nslippage that constitutes negligence\u201d is not deliberate \nindifference.  Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1139. \nB. Title II And Section 504 Claims Are Subject To The \nSame Intent Standards Inside And Outside The Educa-\ntional Context \nIn the decision below, the Eighth Circuit recognized \nthat, outside the context of elementary and secondary \neducation, defendants can be held liable under Title II \nand Section 504 based on their failure to make reasona-\nble accommodations, even absent proof of intentional \ndiscrimination.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  The question \npresented, as set forth in the petition for a writ of certi-\norari, asks whether \u201ca uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u2019 standard\u201d applies to disability- \ndiscrimination claims when plaintiffs \u201cseek[] relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education.\u201d  Pet. i (em-\nphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 brief in opposition does \nnot dispute that, outside of school settings, Section 504 \n\n21 \n \nof the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA do not \nrequire proof of intentional discrimination.3   \nThe Eighth Circuit nevertheless held that, \u201cwhen the \nalleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \u2018based on \neducational services for disabled children,\u2019 a school dis-\ntrict\u2019s simple failure to provide a reasonable accommo-\ndation is not enough to trigger liability.\u201d  Pet. App. 3a \n(citation omitted).  The court applied circuit precedents \nholding that, in the school setting, a plaintiff must prove \n\u201ceither bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d as well.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 5a n.2 (explaining that \nEighth Circuit precedents impose \u201ca high bar for claims \nbased on educational services\u201d even though the court \n\u201crequire[s] much less in other disability-discrimination \ncontexts\u201d).  Nothing in the text or purposes of Title II \nor Section 504 supports that approach.   \n1. The texts of Title II and Section 504 indicate that the \nsame intent standards apply inside and outside the \neducational context \nThe substantive terms of Title II and Section 504\u2014\nwhich include those provisions\u2019 primary bans on disabil-\nity discrimination\u2014do not apply differently in school \nsettings than they do elsewhere.  Title II provides that \n\u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or ac-\ntivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimina-\n \n3 Indeed, respondents state that this Court in Choate, supra, \n\u201cheld that conduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u2018fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30 (quoting Choate, \n469 U.S. at 297).  Respondents argue that \u201c[t]he \u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019 standard takes this instruction [from Choate] into ac-\ncount by proscribing intentional conduct, bad faith, in addition to \nunintentional yet harmful conduct, gross misjudgment.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n22 \n \ntion by any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  Section 504 \nprovides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability  * * *  shall, solely by reason of her or his dis-\nability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany\u201d covered program.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Both statu-\ntory provisions apply to any \u201cqualified individual,\u201d ibid.; \n42 U.S.C. 12132, and neither provision contains any lan-\nguage that distinguishes between educational and non-\neducational contexts (or between elementary and sec-\nondary schools, on the one hand, and colleges on the \nother, see Pet. Br. 43-44).   \nThe same is true of the two Acts\u2019 remedial provisions.  \nUnder the Rehabilitation Act, \u201c[t]he remedies, proce-\ndures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964,\u201d Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. \n2000d et seq.), \u201cshall be available to any person ag-\ngrieved by any act or failure to act by\u201d a federal funding \nrecipient.  29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2).  And \u201c[t]he remedies, \nprocedures, and rights set forth\u201d in the Rehabilitation \nAct are available \u201cto any person alleging discrimina-\ntion\u201d under Title II.  42 U.S.C. 12133.  Accordingly, the \nremedies under each Act are available to \u201cany person\u201d \n\u2014regardless of the setting in which she claims to have \nsuffered disability-based discrimination.  Ibid.; 29 U.S.C. \n794a(a)(2).   \nReading those provisions to require one level of in-\ntent for claims brought in the context of elementary and \nsecondary education, and a different level of intent for \nclaims brought outside that context, would run afoul of \nbasic statutory-interpretation principles.  When a stat-\nutory phrase \u201c\u200a\u2018applies without differentiation\u2019\u200a\u201d to \u201ctwo \ncategories,\u201d courts ordinarily give that phrase the same \nmeaning as applied to both categories.  Pasquantino v. \n\n23 \n \nUnited States, 544 U.S. 349, 358 (2005) (citation omit-\nted).  Because the Eighth Circuit\u2019s heightened intent \nrequirement gives the \u201csame words a different meaning \nfor each category,\u201d that reading would impermissibly \n\u201cinvent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d  Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 378 (2005); see United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality opinion) (not-\ning that the Court has \u201cnever engaged in [the] interpre-\ntive contortion\u201d of \u201cgiving the same word, in the same \nstatutory provision, different meanings in different \nfactual contexts\u201d). \n2. The statutory context supports reading Title II and \nSection 504 to impose the same intent standards in-\nside and outside the educational context  \nFor purposes of the question presented here, the \nonly salient difference between school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims, and other claims brought under \nthose statutes, is that the school-based claims poten-\ntially implicate the IDEA.  That difference, however, \nprovides no sound basis for the Eighth Circuit\u2019s height-\nened intent standard.  To the contrary, the larger stat-\nutory context\u2014which includes both the IDEA and the \ncongressionally articulated purposes of Title II and \nSection 504\u2014confirms that Title II and Section 504 \nclaims based on a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s treatment by an elementary \nor secondary school are governed by the same intent \nstandards that apply to all other Title II and Section 504 \nclaims. \na. The IDEA confirms that Title II and Section 504 \ndo not mean different things in different contexts.  Con-\ntra Br. in Opp. 27-30.  The IDEA provides that, with the \nexception of an exhaustion requirement that is not rel-\nevant here, \u201c[n]othing in\u201d the IDEA \u201cshall be construed \nto restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies \n\n24 \n \navailable under  * * *  the Americans with Disabilities \nAct\u201d or \u201cthe Rehabilitation Act.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).   \nCongress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA in order \nto overturn this Court\u2019s holding in Smith v. Robinson, \n468 U.S. 992 (1984).  In Smith, the Court held that the \nIDEA in its then-current form \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive ave-\nnue\u2019 through which a child with a disability (or his par-\nents) could challenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  \nThe Court accordingly held that the plaintiffs could not \ninvoke the Equal Protection Clause and Section 504  \nas alternative means of vindicating children\u2019s IDEA- \nprotected educational rights.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009-\n1013, 1016-1021. \nIn 1986, Congress responded by enacting the provi-\nsion that is \u201c[n]ow codified\u201d as Section 1415(l), which \n\u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA claims.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 161.  Section 1415(l) \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirm[ed] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA or Rehabilita-\ntion Act \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less integral than the \nIDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of handicapped chil-\ndren.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 296, 99th Cong., 1st \nSess. 4 (1985)).  And Section 1415(l) focused on \u201cremedies \nand relief,\u201d Luna Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, \n148 (2023); see id. at 147-150, making clear that \u201c[n]othing \nin\u201d the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or limit[s] the  * * *  remedies \navailable under\u201d Title II or Section 504, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  \nRequiring plaintiffs to meet a heightened intent re-\nquirement when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims \nin the context of elementary and secondary education \nwould \u201crestrict or limit\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cremedies,\u201d ibid., in plain contravention of the text of \nSection 1415(l). \n\n25 \n \nb. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s school-specific \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d requirement is likewise incon-\nsistent with the congressional purposes identified in the \nrelevant statutory texts.  The Rehabilitation Act seeks \nto maximize the \u201cinclusion and integration into society\u201d \nof individuals with disabilities, including by integrating \nindividuals into the \u201ceducational mainstream of Ameri-\ncan society.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F) and (b)(1); see 29 \nU.S.C. 701(a)(5), (a)(6)(B), and (c)(3).  As already noted, \nwhen it enacted the Rehabilitation Act, Congress \u201cper-\nceived\u201d that \u201c[d]iscrimination against the handicapped \nwas  * * *  most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014\nof benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295.  And sub-\nsequent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act \u201creflec-\nted Congress\u2019 concern with protecting the handicapped \nagainst discrimination stemming not only from simple \nprejudice, but also from \u2018archaic attitudes and laws\u2019 and \nfrom \u2018the fact that the American people [we]re simply \nunfamiliar with and insensitive to the difficulties con-\nfronting individuals with handicaps.\u2019\u200a\u201d  School Bd. of \nNassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 279 (1987) (quo-\nting S. Rep. No. 1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1974)) \n(brackets omitted).   \nCongress enacted Title II of the ADA to extend the \nanti-discrimination principle in the Rehabilitation Act \nbeyond executive-branch agencies and recipients of fed-\neral funds.  See Berardelli v. Allied Servs. Inst. of Re-\nhab. Med., 900 F.3d 104, 115 (3d Cir. 2018); see also Fry, \n580 U.S. at 159-160, 170-171 (noting that Title II and \nSection 504 have substantially similar purposes and cov-\nerage).  The ADA accordingly seeks to further the \u201cgoals\u201d \nof \u201cassur[ing] equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency,\u201d  \n\n26 \n \n42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7), including in the educational con-\ntext, see 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) and (6).   \nRequiring students to make a showing of heightened \nintent when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims in \nthe school context would undermine the goals of max-\nimizing students\u2019 \u201cinclusion and integration\u201d in educa-\ntional institutions and of \u201cassur[ing] equality of\u200a\u201d educa-\ntional \u201copportunity.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F); 42 U.S.C. \n12101(a)(7).  Differential treatment of such claims \nwould be particularly inappropriate because both stat-\nutes expressly acknowledge the importance of curbing \ndisability-based discrimination in \u201ceducation\u201d alongside \nnumerous other situations in which such discrimination \nmay occur.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) (congres-\nsional finding that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities persists in such critical areas as em-\nployment, housing, public accommodations, education, \ntransportation, communication, recreation, institution-\nalization, health services, voting, and access to public \nservices\u201d); 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(5) (\u201c[I]ndividuals with disa-\nbilities continually encounter various forms of discrimi-\nnation in such critical areas as employment, housing, \npublic accommodations, education, transportation, com-\nmunication, recreation, institutionalization, health ser-\nvices, voting, and public services.\u201d).  Applying different \nintent standards inside and outside the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education would undermine \nCongress\u2019s choice to bar even discrimination that arises \nout of \u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d \u201cindifference,\u201d and \u201cbenign ne-\nglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295; cf. Liese, 701 F.3d at 348.  \n\n27 \n \n3. The Eighth Circuit and respondents have identified \nno sound basis for applying a heightened intent  \nrequirement to disability-discrimination claims in \nthe context of elementary and secondary education \nThe Eighth Circuit identified no sound basis for ap-\nplying a heightened \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard to ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought \nin the school context.  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise \nlack merit.   \na. The courts of appeals that apply a \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard to Title II and Section \n504 claims in the educational context have identified no \nsound basis for that heightened standard.  As the court \nof appeals recognized here, Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2, the \nheightened standard originated in its decision in Mo-\nnahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. \ndenied, 460 U.S. 1012 (1983).  In Monahan, the court \naffirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 and \nIDEA claims, which alleged infirmities in the State\u2019s \nprocess for reviewing educational placement decisions.  \nId. at 1167-1168.  The court found that the IDEA claim \nwas moot because it was premised on a challenge to a \nstate law that had been amended since the plaintiffs \nfiled their complaints.  Id. at 1168.  The court further \nfound that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims of violation of \n[Section] 504 seem to rest on the same procedural theo-\nries that plaintiffs have unsuccessfully urged under [the \nIDEA],\u201d dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 claims \nwas appropriate as well.  Id. at 1170. \nAfter reaching that conclusion, the Eighth Circuit \n\u201cadd[ed] a few words for the guidance of the District \nCourt and the parties\u201d in the event the plaintiffs \u201cre-\nfil[ed]  * * *  a new complaint.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at \n1170.  The court stated that a plaintiff must prove \u201cei-\n\n28 \n \nther bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to \u201cshow[]\u201d a Sec-\ntion 504 \u201cviolation  * * *  at least in the context of edu-\ncation of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  The court \nviewed such a standard as necessary because \u201c[t]he Re-\nhabilitation Act and [the IDEA] are entirely different \nstatutes\u201d; because the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard would \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \nintended by Congress\u201d; and because the intent require-\nment would \u201cproper[ly] balance  * * *  the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state edu-\ncation officials, and the competence of courts to make \njudgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id. at 1170-1171. \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d stand-\nard had no basis in the then-current text of the Rehabil-\nitation Act.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  And Congress\u2019s sub-\nsequent addition of Section 1415(l) to the IDEA con-\nfirms the impropriety of imposing uniquely stringent \nrequirements for school-based disability-discrimination \nclaims.  Two years after the Eighth Circuit decided Mo-\nnahan, this Court similarly read Section 504 and the \nIDEA to cover separate ground, holding that the IDEA \nwas \u201cthe exclusive avenue\u201d for challenging the ade-\nquacy of a child\u2019s education.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009; \nsee p. 24, supra.  Congress promptly rejected that ap-\nproach, however, by enacting Section 1415(l), which \nprovides that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be con-\nstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and \nremedies available under\u201d Title II and Section 504.  20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l); see pp. 6-7, 23-24, supra.  By imposing a \nheightened intent requirement only on Section 504 \nclaims that arise \u201cin the context of education of\u200a\u201d chil-\ndren with disabilities, 687 F.2d at 1171, Monahan read \nthe IDEA to \u201climit the rights\u201d and \u201cremedies available \nunder\u201d the Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l)\u2014an in-\n\n29 \n \nterpretation that is now expressly foreclosed by Section \n1415(l). \nb. Respondents\u2019 defense of Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard fares no better. \ni. Respondents have observed (Br. in Opp. 26) that \npetitioner\u2019s private rights of action under Title II and \nSection 504 stem from the judicially implied cause of ac-\ntion under Title VI.  Respondents contend that this Court \ntherefore has a \u201cmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible \nremedial scheme that best comports with the statute.\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  Re-\nspondents further claim (Br. in Opp. 27) that the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standard \u201cis an appropriate exer-\ncise of that discretion\u201d because Title II and Section 504 \nclaims in the educational context may overlap with \nIDEA claims and touch on educational policy.  Given the \nrelief available under the IDEA, plaintiffs who allege \ndisability-based discrimination in elementary and sec-\nondary schools may less often have a practical need to \ninvoke the remedies that Title II and Section 504 pro-\nvide.  There is no sound basis, however, for applying a \ndifferent legal standard to school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims than to other claims brought under \nthose statutes. \nIn Gebser, this Court recognized that, \u201c[b]ecause the \nprivate right of action under Title IX is judicially im-\nplied,\u201d no statutory language specifies the standard \nthat governs damages claims under that law.  524 U.S. \nat 284.  The Court explained that, when \u201cshap[ing] a \nsensible remedial scheme that best comports with the \nstatute,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] the relevant statute to \nensure that [the Court does] not fashion the scope of an \nimplied right in a manner at odds with the statutory \nstructure and purpose.\u201d  Ibid.  Applying that analysis \n\n30 \n \nhere, the statutory text, structure, context, and purpose \nall point in the same direction:  Congress intended Title \nII and Section 504 to apply fully in the educational con-\ntext, even if claims under those statutes sometimes \noverlap with IDEA claims.  See pp. 21-26, supra.  In-\ndeed, Congress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA to \nrepudiate the inference that this overlap in coverage \nshould affect Title II\u2019s and Section 504\u2019s application to \nschool-based claims.  See pp. 23-24, supra. \nThere is consequently no basis in the \u201cstatutory \nstructure\u201d or \u201cpurpose,\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284, for the \neducation-specific intent requirement that the Monahan \ncourt adopted.  And it would \u201cfrustrate the purposes\u201d of \nTitle II and Section 504, id. at 285\u2014which seek to elimi-\nnate disability-based discrimination equally within and \noutside the educational context, see pp. 25-26, supra\u2014\nto apply a heightened intent standard solely to school-\nbased claims.   \nii. Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that the \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is more con-\nsistent with the Court\u2019s statement in Choate that \u201cmuch \nof the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing \nthe Rehabilitation Act would be difficult if not impossi-\nble to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only \nconduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  469 U.S. at \n296-297.  In respondents\u2019 view, \u201cthe \u2018deliberate indiffer-\nence\u2019 standard\u201d is less consistent with Choate because \nit \u201cstill requires discriminatory intent.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30-\n31; see p. 21 n.3, supra.  But Choate, which involved a \nclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief, discussed \nonly the requirements for proving disability discrimina-\ntion, see 469 U.S. at 289, 292-299; it did not discuss the \nrequirements for obtaining damages, which all agree in-\nclude a showing of intent, see Br. in Opp. 26. \n\n31 \n \nIn briefly defending the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudg-\nment\u201d standard, respondents appear to contend (Br. in \nOpp. 31-32) that the standard applies to all Title II and \nSection 504 claims, not simply to those that involve ele-\nmentary and secondary education.  But no court of ap-\npeals has adopted that view, and the decision below \nmade clear that the court viewed the standard as a height-\nened intent requirement that applies only to school-\nbased claims.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  And respond-\nents\u2019 argument is not directly responsive to the question \npresented in the petition for a writ of certiorari, which \nasks this Court to consider whether \u201cchildren with dis-\nabilities\u201d must \u201csatisfy a uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u2019 standard when seeking relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education\u201d under Title \nII or Section 504.  Pet. i (emphasis added); see p. 20, \nsupra. \niii.  Respondents observe (Br. in Opp. 31) that Con-\ngress enacted Section 1415(l) to overturn this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Smith, and that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision \nin Monahan is \u201cdistinct\u201d from Smith.  To be sure, the \nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Monahan was less restric-\ntive than this Court\u2019s decision in Smith, because the \nEighth Circuit announced a heightened intent standard \nfor school-based Title II and Section 504 claims but did \nnot hold that such claims are entirely foreclosed.  But \nwhile Smith was the immediate impetus for Congress\u2019s \nenactment of Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s reasoning and \nits \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard are sim-\nilarly inconsistent with Section 1415(l)\u2019s plain text.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nadopted in Monahan reflected the Eighth Circuit\u2019s at-\ntempt \u201cto harmonize the Rehabilitation Act and the \n[IDEA] to the fullest extent possible.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  \n\n32 \n \nBut Section 1415(l) now expressly provides that \n\u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder\u201d Title II or Section 504.  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  That \nlanguage \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirms the viability\u2019 of federal statutes \nlike the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \u2018as separate vehi-\ncles,\u2019 no less integral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the \nrights of handicapped children.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 \n(brackets and citation omitted).  Congress thus disap-\nproved of efforts to invoke the IDEA\u2019s remedial scheme \nas a justification for narrowing the coverage of Title II \nor Section 504.  Respondents are correct that \u201cSection \n1415(l) does not  * * *  opine on the standard governing\u201d \nclaims under those statutes.  Br. in Opp. 31.  But Section \n1415(l) clearly indicates that the same intent standards \n\u2014both for liability and for damages\u2014should govern \nschool-based and non-school-based Title II and Section \n504 claims.   \niv.  Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 28) that applying \nthe deliberate-indifference standard \u201cwould open the \ndoor for plaintiffs to end-run the statutorily prescribed \nIEP process.\u201d  But regardless of the applicable intent \nstandard, a plaintiff who wishes to bring Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 claims must first comply with Section 1415(l)\u2019s \nadministrative-exhaustion requirement whenever that \nrequirement applies.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (explain-\ning that \u201cthe second half of [Section] 1415(l)  * * *  im-\nposes a limit  * * *  in the form of an exhaustion provi-\nsion\u201d on Section 1415(l)\u2019s general rule that Title II and \nSection 504 claims are unaffected by the IDEA); id. at \n165 (summarizing the analysis used to determine \nwhether Section 1415(l)\u2019s exhaustion requirement ap-\nplies to a particular claim).  Indeed, Section 1415(l)\u2019s ex-\nplicit directive that ADA and Rehabilitation Act plain-\n\n33 \n \ntiffs must satisfy the IDEA\u2019s exhaustion requirement \nprovides further evidence that school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims are not subject to any other education-\nspecific restrictions.   \nRespondents also contend that a heightened intent \nrequirement is necessary to avoid \u201cinhibit[ing] the abil-\nity of schools and parents to \u2018work cooperatively to find \nthe best education placement and services for the \nchild.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Op. 28 (brackets and citation omitted).  \nBut as explained above, see pp. 19-20, supra, schools \ncannot be held liable for damages when they merely \nmake mistakes, act negligently, or engage in bureau-\ncratic inaction that delays the delivery of services.  The \ndeliberate-indifference standard correctly respects the \nbalance Congress struck in Title II and Section 504:  It \npermits damages claims against covered entities that \nengage in disability discrimination, but only where they \nhave \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of a substantial likelihood \u201cof \ndiscrimination in the recipient\u2019s programs\u201d and yet re-\nspond with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 290.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a search for the Respondent's (Osseo Area Schools) Brief on the Merits, which was unsuccessful. Instead, the search returned the Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for certiorari. This observation does not provide the crucial missing evidence (the Respondent's full merits argument) but does allow for a significant refinement of my understanding of their defensive strategy, moving it from prediction to confirmed fact based on their initial filing.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is Real and Important (Belief Stable and Strengthened):** This belief remains foundational. Seeing the Respondent's specific arguments in their BIO *against* granting certiorari\u2014claiming no meaningful circuit split, poor vehicle, and correctness of the lower court ruling\u2014and knowing the Court granted review anyway, strengthens the signal that a majority of justices see a pressing legal issue that transcends the Respondent's objections.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable):** My detailed understanding of the Petitioner's arguments, centered on textual primacy, statutory conflict (*Perez*), legislative purpose (*Alexander v. Choate*), and judicial overreach, remains unchanged. This observation does not concern the Petitioner's filings.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Posture Confirmed and Detailed (Belief Refined from \"Predicted\" to \"Confirmed\"):** My previous belief about the Respondent's strategy was an inference. The BIO provides direct evidence confirming and detailing their arguments for upholding the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. Their defense, as articulated at the certiorari stage, is built on three pillars:\n    *   **Pragmatism and Judicial Prudence:** They frame the standard not as an interpretation of the ADA's text, but as a \"sensible remedial scheme\" and a necessary judicial solution to the \"conceptual peculiarity\" of the IDEA/ADA overlap. They argue courts appropriately developed this standard to manage claims challenging educational services provided under the IDEA.\n    *   **Minimizing the Circuit Split:** They contend there is \"no meaningful disagreement\" among the circuits. They argue that while circuits use \"different verbal formulations,\" they all agree on a high standard of discriminatory intent that requires a substantial deviation from accepted professional practices. This is an attempt to frame the split as semantic, not substantive.\n    *   **Deference to Educators:** They explicitly defend the standard as a necessary tool for deferring to the professional judgment of school authorities. Citing *Endrew F.*, they argue against courts \"substitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy\" and position the *Monahan* standard as the proper mechanism for this deference.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: Statutory Text vs. Judicially-Crafted Prudential Rule (Belief Sharpened):** The BIO confirms that the Respondent is not primarily defending their position on textual grounds. Instead, they are defending the *Monahan* standard as a 40-year-old, court-created prudential doctrine necessary for the proper functioning of special education law. This crystallizes the central conflict of the case: The Petitioner's argument from pure statutory text versus the Respondent's defense of a longstanding, atextual judicial standard justified by structural and policy concerns. This framing makes the case a classic test of the current Court's textualist versus pragmatist inclinations.\n\n5.  **Analysis Remains Provisionally One-Sided, Highlighting a Critical Knowledge Gap (Meta-Belief Reinforced):** The failure of the search to locate the Respondent's Brief on the Merits strongly reinforces that my analysis is incomplete. While the BIO provides a clear preview, the full merits brief is where the Respondent will engage directly with the Petitioner's textualist arguments and precedents like *Perez*. The absence of this document remains the single largest source of uncertainty in my predictive model. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome is high but contingent on the (currently unknown) strength of the Respondent's forthcoming arguments on the merits.",

This clarification makes the subsequent information-gathering action more efficient and targeted, thus providing a small but non-zero gain in understanding how to finalize the prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.6): This action provides significant value by demonstrating a core principle of effective BOED strategy: explicitly identifying and prioritizing the greatest source of model uncertainty. The agent correctly recognizes that despite the overwhelming evidence from one side, a robust prediction requires a full understanding of the opposing arguments. This reinforces the design principle that a dialectical analysis of the core merits briefs is essential. The thought process perfectly models the 'what is the most important thing I don't know right now?' heuristic, which is a key component of an efficient prediction strategy.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the amicus brief filed by the United States Solicitor General (SG) in support of the Petitioner. This is a highly significant development, as the SG's views carry substantial weight with the Court, and the executive branch (through the Departments of Justice and Education) is responsible for enforcing the statutes in question. This observation provides a powerful, government-backed legal framework for deciding the case and dramatically strengthens the Petitioner's position.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Massively Strengthened):** This foundational belief is now reinforced to its highest level yet. The decision by the Solicitor General to file a merits-stage amicus brief, siding with the Petitioner, confirms that the U.S. government views the question presented as a critical issue of statutory interpretation with nationwide implications for the enforcement of federal disability law. The SG's involvement signals that the circuit split is not merely academic but creates real-world confusion that impedes the uniform application of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Strongly Corroborated):** The SG's brief provides powerful, independent corroboration for the Petitioner's core arguments. The government's position aligns with the Petitioner's on the primacy of statutory text, the lack of any \"education exception\" in the ADA or Section 504, and the dispositive effect of the IDEA's savings clause (\u00a7 1415(l)) as interpreted in *Luna Perez* and *Fry*. The SG's endorsement validates the Petitioner's legal strategy and adds the institutional credibility of the executive branch to their textualist and structural claims.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Posture is Now Under Direct Government Attack (Belief Refined):** My understanding of the Respondent's defense\u2014relying on judicial prudence, deference to educators, and the legacy of the *Monahan* standard\u2014remains stable. However, the viability of this defense is now severely undermined. The SG's brief systematically dismantles it:\n    *   **Against Prudentialism:** The SG argues that the text of the ADA and Section 504 is clear and does not permit courts to invent atextual, \"sensible remedial schemes\" like the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard.\n    *   **Against Deference via \"Bad Faith\":** The SG provides the Court with an alternative, textually-grounded mechanism for deference: the \"deliberate indifference\" standard required to obtain compensatory damages. The SG argues this standard correctly protects schools from liability for \"mere mistakes or negligence\" without requiring the judiciary to invent a heightened liability standard that has no basis in the statute. This directly counters the Respondent's primary policy justification for the *Monahan* rule.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Clear Path to Resolution Emerges (Belief Sharpened and Nuanced):** The conflict between statutory text and the judicially-crafted *Monahan* rule is now framed with a clear, government-endorsed solution. The SG's brief introduces a crucial nuance that could be decisive: a two-tiered framework for liability and remedy.\n    *   **Step 1 (Violation):** A plaintiff can establish a *violation* of the ADA/Section 504 without proving any discriminatory intent, based on the plain text of the statutes. This would require overturning the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard for establishing liability.\n    *   **Step 2 (Remedy):** To recover *compensatory damages* (as opposed to injunctive relief), a plaintiff *must* prove intentional discrimination, which can be satisfied by showing the school district's \"deliberate indifference\" to the student's federally protected rights.\n    This framework, rooted in the Court's Title IX jurisprudence (*Gebser*, *Davis*), offers a compelling path for the Court. It allows the justices to vindicate the statutory text (pleasing textualists) while still providing a high bar for monetary damages (assuaging pragmatists' concerns about overwhelming schools with litigation).\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention as a Decisive Predictive Signal (New Belief):** The SG's support for the Petitioner is the most powerful predictive signal to date. The government's proposed \"violation/deliberate indifference for damages\" framework is legally sophisticated, aligns with the Court's recent precedents (*Perez*, *Fry*), and provides an elegant resolution to the case. It allows the Court to reject the atextual \"bad faith\" standard while affirming a robust, but not unlimited, path to relief for plaintiffs.\n\n6.  **Analysis Remains Provisionally One-Sided, but Confidence in Pro-Petitioner Outcome Skyrockets (Meta-Belief Updated):** The critical knowledge gap\u2014the Respondent's full merits brief\u2014still exists. However, its importance is diminished in the face of the SG's filing. The Respondent must now argue not only against the Petitioner but also against the reasoned position of the United States government and its proposed legal framework. The burden on the Respondent has increased exponentially. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome, likely involving the vacating of the Eighth Circuit's judgment and the rejection of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, is now very high. The key uncertainty is no longer *if* the Petitioner will win, but *what specific standard* the Court will adopt in its place, with the SG's \"deliberate indifference for damages\" framework now being the leading candidate.",

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.

There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal thought process, a meta-level reflection on my current belief state and a plan for future information gathering. It summarizes my analysis to date and identifies the most significant remaining uncertainty: the content of the Respondent's merits brief. As this observation does not introduce new external evidence, facts, or legal arguments related to the case, my substantive task beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, though my focus on the next critical piece of evidence is sharpened.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Massively Strengthened):** This foundational belief is reinforced to its highest level. The Solicitor General's decision to file a merits-stage amicus brief siding with the Petitioner confirms that the U.S. government views the question presented as a critical issue of statutory interpretation with nationwide implications for enforcing federal disability law. The SG's involvement signals that the circuit split creates real-world confusion that impedes the uniform application of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Strongly Corroborated):** The SG's brief provides powerful, independent corroboration for the Petitioner's core arguments. The government's position aligns with the Petitioner's on the primacy of statutory text, the lack of any \"education exception\" in the ADA or Section 504, and the dispositive effect of the IDEA's savings clause (\u00a7 1415(l)) as interpreted in *Luna Perez* and *Fry*. The SG's endorsement validates the Petitioner's legal strategy and adds the institutional credibility of the executive branch to their textualist and structural claims.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Posture is Now Under Direct Government Attack (Belief Refined):** My understanding of the Respondent's defense\u2014relying on judicial prudence, deference to educators, and the legacy of the *Monahan* standard\u2014remains stable. However, the viability of this defense is now severely undermined. The SG's brief systematically dismantles it:\n    *   **Against Prudentialism:** The SG argues that the text of the ADA and Section 504 is clear and does not permit courts to invent atextual, \"sensible remedial schemes\" like the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard.\n    *   **Against Deference via \"Bad Faith\":** The SG provides the Court with an alternative, textually-grounded mechanism for deference: the \"deliberate indifference\" standard required to obtain compensatory damages. The SG argues this standard correctly protects schools from liability for \"mere mistakes or negligence\" without requiring the judiciary to invent a heightened liability standard that has no basis in the statute. This directly counters the Respondent's primary policy justification for the *Monahan* rule.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Clear Path to Resolution Emerges (Belief Sharpened and Nuanced):** The conflict between statutory text and the judicially-crafted *Monahan* rule is now framed with a clear, government-endorsed solution. The SG's brief introduces a crucial nuance that could be decisive: a two-tiered framework for liability and remedy.\n    *   **Step 1 (Violation):** A plaintiff can establish a *violation* of the ADA/Section 504 without proving any discriminatory intent, based on the plain text of the statutes. This would require overturning the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard for establishing liability.\n    *   **Step 2 (Remedy):** To recover *compensatory damages* (as opposed to injunctive relief), a plaintiff *must* prove intentional discrimination, which can be satisfied by showing the school district's \"deliberate indifference\" to the student's federally protected rights.\n    This framework, rooted in the Court's Title IX jurisprudence (*Gebser*, *Davis*), offers a compelling path for the Court. It allows the justices to vindicate the statutory text (pleasing textualists) while still providing a high bar for monetary damages (assuaging pragmatists' concerns about overwhelming schools with litigation).\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention as a Decisive Predictive Signal (Belief Stable):** The SG's support for the Petitioner remains the most powerful predictive signal to date. The government's proposed \"violation/deliberate indifference for damages\" framework is legally sophisticated, aligns with the Court's recent precedents (*Perez*, *Fry*), and provides an elegant resolution to the case. It allows the Court to reject the atextual \"bad faith\" standard while affirming a robust, but not unlimited, path to relief for plaintiffs.\n\n6.  **Analysis Remains Provisionally One-Sided, but Confidence in Pro-Petitioner Outcome Skyrockets (Meta-Belief Updated and Refocused):** The critical knowledge gap\u2014the Respondent's full merits brief\u2014still exists, and the latest observation confirms its central importance. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome, likely involving the vacating of the Eighth Circuit's judgment and the rejection of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, remains very high. However, the Respondent must now argue not only against the Petitioner but also against the reasoned position of the United States government. The burden on the Respondent has increased exponentially. The key uncertainty is no longer *if* the Petitioner will win, but *what specific standard* the Court will adopt in its place, with the SG's \"deliberate indifference for damages\" framework being the leading candidate. Resolving this uncertainty requires a full analysis of the Respondent's counterarguments.",

These briefs may introduce new legal theories, historical evidence, or 'parade of horribles' scenarios that could sway key justices, thus directly impacting my predictive model of the outcome. The Design EIG is also significant (0.6) because it reinforces a core principle of SCOTUS prediction: after understanding the parties' positions, one must map the constellation of interests through amicus filings. This action allows me to refine my methodology for weighing the influence of different types of amici and arguments (e.g., practical vs. purely legal), a generalizable skill for future cases.

The beliefs are highly coherent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and a clear, seamless narrative connecting legal theories, evidentiary signals, and outcome predictions (0.92 coherence).

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Proof of discriminatory intent is not required to \ndemonstrate a violation of Title II or Section 504,  \nbut such proof is required to recover damages \nunder those provisions .................................................... 12 \n1. To establish a violation of Title II or Section \n504, a plaintiff need not prove that the \ndefendant intended to engage in disability \ndiscrimination ............................................................ 13 \n2. To obtain compensatory damages for Title II \nand Section 504 violations, a plaintiff must \nprove intentional discrimination, which may be \nshown by proving deliberate indifference .............. 15 \nB. Title II and Section 504 claims are subject to the \nsame intent standards inside and outside the \neducational context.......................................................... 20 \n1. The texts of Title II and Section 504 indicate \nthat the same intent standards apply inside and \noutside the educational context ............................... 21 \n2. The statutory context supports reading Title II \nand Section 504 to impose the same intent stan-\ndards inside and outside the educational context ... 23 \n3.

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citation \nomitted); see id. at 24a-25a.  The court applied that \nstandard and concluded that respondents \u201cdid not act \nwith bad faith or gross misjudgment when making edu-\ncational decisions regarding\u201d petitioner.  Id. at 7a; see \nid. at 25a-36a.   \nb. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-5a.  \nThe court explained that, under Eighth Circuit prece-\ndent, when \u201calleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \n\u2018based on educational services for disabled children,\u2019  \n* * *  a plaintiff must prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d in order \nto establish the defendants\u2019 \u201cliability.\u201d  Id. at 3a (cita-\ntions omitted).  The court concluded that, although pe-\ntitioner \u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether [respondents were] negligent or even deliber-\nately indifferent,\u201d she had failed to provide sufficient \nevidence of \u201c\u200a\u2018bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d to with-\nstand respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 3a-5a.  The court made clear \nthat it viewed the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard as significantly more demanding than the in-\ntent standard that applies to non-school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims.  See id. at 5a n.2 (noting that  \nthe court \u201crequire[s] much less in other disability- \ndiscrimination contexts\u201d). \nAlthough the court of appeals applied the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as a matter of circuit \nprecedent, the court questioned the legal basis for that \nstandard.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  The court explained that \nthe standard had originated in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n\n10 \n \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983), in which the court had \u201cspeculated that Con-\ngress intended\u201d the IDEA \u201cto limit Section 504\u2019s pro-\ntections, and without any anchor in statutory text,  * * *  \nadded a judicial gloss on Section 504 to achieve that end.\u201d  \nPet. App. 5a n.2.  The court further noted that, although \nCongress had later \u201crejected Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d by \nenacting Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment rule\u201d had continued to \u201cspread like wild-\nfire.\u201d  Ibid.  The court accordingly viewed the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as offering \u201ca lesson in \n\u2018why we do not  . . .  add provisions to  . . .  federal stat-\nutes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (brackets and citation omitted).   \nc. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc, \nwith Judges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes noting that they \nwould have granted the petition for en banc rehearing.  \nPet. App. 44a-45a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA.  1.  To establish a violation of Title II of the ADA \nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff need \nonly prove that she was an individual with a disability \nwho was discriminated against by reason of her disabil-\nity.  Those showings can be made without proof that the \ndefendant intended to discriminate.  Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 are framed in the passive voice and do not sug-\ngest that an actor\u2019s bad intent is an element of a statu-\ntory violation.  Accordingly, a plaintiff may obtain in-\njunctive relief under Title II or Section 504 without \nproving intent to discriminate, as long as the other re-\nquirements for injunctive relief are satisfied.   \n2.  To obtain compensatory damages under Title II \nor Section 504, however, a plaintiff must prove inten-\ntional discrimination; to do so, she must at a minimum \nprove deliberate indifference.  Both the intent require-\n\n11 \n \nment and the deliberate-indifference standard are drawn \nfrom this Court\u2019s decisions interpreting similar stat-\nutes.  And the deliberate-indifference standard\u2014which \nrequires proof that a covered entity failed to act despite \nits actual knowledge that a federally protected right \nwas substantially likely to be violated\u2014ensures that \nschools will not incur damages liability on account of \nmistakes, negligence, or bureaucratic inaction.  That \nstandard also appropriately balances the relevant con-\nsiderations that this Court has identified:  It ensures \nthat regulated entities will have notice before they are \nheld liable for damages, and it gives them the necessary \nflexibility to implement their programs, while also sup-\nporting the ADA\u2019s and the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s goals of \nassuring that people with disabilities have equal oppor-\ntunities and are fully integrated into society.   \nB.  1.  Some courts have applied a heightened intent \nstandard\u2014\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d\u2014to Title \nII and Section 504 claims that arise in the context of el-\nementary or secondary education.  The Court should re-\nject that approach.  Because the texts of Title II and \nSection 504 do not distinguish between school and non-\nschool settings, there is no sound basis for that idiosyn-\ncratic heightened standard. \n2.  The statutory context reinforces that conclusion.  \nFor these purposes, the only potentially salient distinc-\ntion between school and non-school settings is that the \nschool setting is also subject to the IDEA.  But impos-\ning a heightened intent requirement on that basis would \ncontravene Congress\u2019s directive that the IDEA should \nnot be read to \u201crestrict or limit  * * *  the remedies \navailable under\u201d the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  Indeed, Congress enacted Section \n1415(l) in order to overturn a decision of this Court that \n\n12 \n \nhad read the IDEA to preclude application of Section \n504 in the context of elementary and secondary educa-\ntion.  A heightened intent requirement would also dis-\nserve the purposes of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct, which broadly seek to end disability discrimination \nthroughout society, including in elementary and sec-\nondary schools. \n3.  Like other courts that have adopted the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard, the Eighth Circuit be-\nlow has identified no sound basis for that standard.  Ra-\nther, the standard originated in dictum that was wrong \nwhen it was first articulated and has been further dis-\ncredited by Congress\u2019s intervening enactment of Sec-\ntion 1415(l).  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise have no \nbasis in the statutory text or context, and the policy con-\ncerns that respondents invoke are overstated. \nARGUMENT \nA. Proof Of Discriminatory Intent Is Not Required To \nDemonstrate A Violation Of Title II Or Section 504, But \nSuch Proof Is Required To Recover Damages Under \nThose Provisions \nUnder Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Re-\nhabilitation Act, plaintiffs may bring suit seeking \u201cmoney \ndamages\u201d and \u201cinjunctive relief.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Com-\nmunity Sch., 580 U.S. 154, 160 (2017).  Well-established \nlegal standards govern those claims.  To demonstrate a \nviolation of Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff need not \nprove that the defendant intended to engage in disabil-\nity discrimination.  And a plaintiff need not make a show-\ning of discriminatory intent in order to obtain injunctive \nor other equitable relief under those statutes.  But a \nplaintiff seeking compensatory damages must prove in-\ntentional discrimination; she may make that showing by \nproving deliberate indifference.  As discussed below in \n\n13 \n \nPart B, those standards also apply in the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education.   \n1. To establish a violation of Title II or Section 504, a \nplaintiff need not prove that the defendant intended \nto engage in disability discrimination \nBy its plain terms, Section 504 protects a covered in-\ndividual from specified outcomes\u2014\u201cbe[ing] excluded\u201d \nfrom participation, \u201cbe[ing] denied\u201d benefits, or \u201cbe[ing] \nsubjected to\u201d discrimination\u2014when the adverse effect \noccurs \u201csolely by reason of,\u201d i.e., has a sufficient causal \nlink to, that individual\u2019s disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a); cf. \nHemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 9 (2010).  \nSection 504 is written in the \u201cpassive voice,\u201d \u201cfocus[ing] \non an event that occurs without respect to a specific ac-\ntor, and therefore without respect to any actor\u2019s intent \nor culpability.\u201d  Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. 568, 572 \n(2009).  \u201cCongress\u2019 use of the passive voice\u201d \u201cindicates \nthat [Section 504] does not require proof of intent.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThis Court has also observed that, when Congress \nenacted the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, \u201c[d]iscrimina-\ntion against the handicapped was perceived by Con-\ngress to be most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014of \nbenign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985).  For that reason, \u201cmuch of the conduct that Con-\ngress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act \nwould be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act \nconstrued to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discrim-\ninatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 296-297.  The same is true of the \nkey provision of Title II of the ADA, which was modeled \non Section 504 and is also in the passive voice.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 12132 (\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from par-\n\n14 \n \nticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjec-\nted to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d).  A height-\nened intent standard for establishing liability would \nalso undermine the congressional objectives articulated \nin the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act:  maximizing the \n\u201cinclusion and integration\u201d into \u201csociety\u201d of individuals \nwith disabilities, 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F), and \u201cassur[ing] \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency\u201d for persons with \ndisabilities, 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7).  See pp. 25-26, infra \n(discussing the purposes of those statutes in more de-\ntail); see also S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d \n248, 264 (3d Cir. 2013). \nAs a general matter, the courts of appeals have \nagreed that a plaintiff need not prove intent to discrim-\ninate in order to establish a violation of Title II or Sec-\ntion 504.  See, e.g., Ruskai v. Pistole, 775 F.3d 61, 78 (1st \nCir. 2014); but see Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of \nTenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 235, 241 (6th Cir. 2019).  Thus, they \nhave described proof of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d (an in-\ntent showing, see pp. 15-18, infra) as \u201can additional hur-\ndle\u201d that under Title II and Section 504 applies only  \nto claims for \u201cdamages.\u201d  Silberman v. Miami Dade \nTransit, 927 F.3d 1123, 1134 (11th Cir. 2019).  The courts \nof appeals have also explained that \u201cequitable remedies \nfor violations of the ADA\u201d\u2014including \u201cinjunction[s] man-\ndating compliance with its provisions\u201d\u2014\u201care available \nregardless of a defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d  Midgett v. Tri-\nCounty Metro. Transp. Dist., 254 F.3d 846, 851 (9th Cir. \n2001); see Hall v. Higgins, 77 F.4th 1171, 1180-1181 (8th \nCir. 2023) (indicating that the need to show deliberate \nindifference applies only to damages claims); D.E. v. \nCentral Dauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 269 (3d Cir. \n\n15 \n \n2014) (similar); Mark H. v. Hamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090, \n1097 (9th Cir. 2010) (similar). \n2. To obtain compensatory damages for Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 violations, a plaintiff must prove intentional \ndiscrimination, which may be shown by proving de-\nliberate indifference  \nA private plaintiff seeking money damages for a vio-\nlation of Title II or Section 504 must prove that the de-\nfendant engaged in intentional discrimination.  A plain-\ntiff may prove that discriminatory intent by demon-\nstrating that the defendant acted with deliberate indif-\nference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s federally protected rights\u2014a \nstandard that is properly understood to require a show-\ning considerably higher than negligence. \na. To demonstrate an entitlement to compensatory \ndamages under Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff must \nprove that the covered entity intentionally discriminated \nagainst the plaintiff.  Petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 7) \nthat \u201cpeople with disabilities may not obtain damages \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act without proving \nintent.\u201d  And the courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that, \u201c[t]o recover monetary damages under Ti-\ntle II of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff \nmust prove intentional discrimination on the part of the \ndefendant.\u201d  Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, \n1138 (9th Cir. 2001) (footnote omitted); see, e.g., S.H., \n729 F.3d at 260-262; Liese v. Indian River County \nHosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 344 (11th Cir. 2012); Meagley \nv. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011); \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009); Barber v. Colorado Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 562 \nF.3d 1222, 1228 (10th Cir. 2009). \nA discriminatory-intent requirement for damages \nclaims under Title II and Section 504 is consistent with \n\n16 \n \nthis Court\u2019s decisions interpreting Title IX of the Edu-\ncation Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. \n373-375.  Title IX\u2019s prohibition on discrimination is sim-\nilar to that in the Rehabilitation Act, although Title IX \naddresses sex discrimination in federally funded educa-\ntional programs and activities, while the Rehabilitation \nAct addresses disability discrimination in all programs \nand activities conducted by recipients of federal funds.  \nCompare 20 U.S.C. 1681(a), with 29 U.S.C. 794(a).  \u201cWhen \nCongress attaches conditions to the award of federal \nfunds under its spending power,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] \nclosely the propriety of private actions holding the re-\ncipient liable in monetary damages for noncompliance \nwith the condition.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. \nDist., 524 U.S. 274, 287 (1998).  The Court in Gebser con-\ncluded that, while equitable relief might be appropriate \nto undo the effects of unintentional Title IX violations \nand prevent such violations from recurring, only inten-\ntional violators are subject to damages liability.  See id. \nat 287-291; Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 74-75 (1992).  The same approach is appropriate \nunder Title II and Section 504.   \nb. To prove intent to discriminate, a Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 plaintiff needs to show that an entity acted with \nat least deliberate indifference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s feder-\nally protected rights.  That standard is grounded in this \nCourt\u2019s decisions in Gebser, supra, and Davis v. Monroe \nCounty Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), and in \nthe similarities between those statutes and Title IX.  \nAnd outside the educational context, courts of appeals \nhave generally concluded that a plaintiff can prove in-\ntentional discrimination by demonstrating deliberate \nindifference on the part of a covered entity.  See, e.g., \nS.H., 729 F.3d at 262-265; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344-351; \n\n17 \n \nMeagley, 639 F.3d at 389-390; Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275; \nBarber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229; Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1138-\n1139.1 \nIn Gebser, the Court considered the circumstances in \nwhich an educational institution receiving federal funds \nmay be held liable for damages under Title IX for sexual \nharassment of a student by a teacher.  524 U.S. at 277.  \nThe Court concluded that damages could be recovered \nin such a case only when \u201can official who at a minimum \nhas authority to address the alleged discrimination and \nto institute corrective measures on the recipient\u2019s be-\nhalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recip-\nient\u2019s programs\u201d and responds with \u201cdeliberate indif-\nference to [the] discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 290.  In adopting \nthe deliberate-indifference standard, the Court ex-\nplained that Title IX \u201cattaches conditions to the award \nof federal funds,\u201d and that a federal funding recipient \ngenerally should have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that it will be liable for a \nmonetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 287 (citation omitted).  The \nCourt also noted that Title IX\u2019s express remedial scheme, \nwhich allows termination of federal funding by the gov-\nernment, is predicated on notice and an opportunity for \nthe recipient to rectify a violation.  Id. at 289.  The Court \naccordingly found that Congress did not intend to sub-\nject a recipient of federal funding to damages liability \n \n1 Proof of discriminatory intent does not require evidence of dis-\ncriminatory animus.  The courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that the deliberate-indifference standard \u201cdoes not require a \nshowing of personal ill will or animosity toward the disabled person; \nrather, \u2018intentional discrimination can be inferred from a defend-\nant\u2019s deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of \nits questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally \nprotected rights.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Barber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229 (citation omitted); \nsee, e.g., S.H., 729 F.3d at 263; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Loeffler, 582 \nF.3d at 275. \n\n18 \n \nin a private Title IX action when the recipient \u201cwas un-\naware of discrimination in its programs and is willing to \ninstitute prompt corrective measures.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn Davis, the Court extended Gebser to claims alleg-\ning \u201cstudent-on-student harassment,\u201d holding that dam-\nages can be awarded against a school board under Title \nIX \u201cwhere the funding recipient acts with deliberate in-\ndifference to known acts of harassment in its programs \nor activities.\u201d  Davis, 526 U.S. at 633.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court emphasized that deliberate indif-\nference is a \u201chigh standard\u201d that allows \u201c[s]chool admin-\nistrators [to] continue to enjoy the flexibility they re-\nquire\u201d because a plaintiff must prove \u201cactual knowledge\u201d \nof discrimination and \u201c\u200a\u2018an official decision by the recip-\nient not to remedy the violation.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 642-643, 648 \n(citation omitted). \nGebser\u2019s rationales for adopting the deliberate- \nindifference standard apply with full force to damages \nclaims under Section 504.  See Liese, 701 F.3d at 348 \n(\u201cBecause of the similarities between Title IX and the \n[Rehabilitation Act], Gebser\u2019s  * * *  reasoning applies \nwith similar force to the [Rehabilitation Act] and yields \nthe same result.\u201d).  And while the ADA is not a Spend-\ning Clause statute, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1, Title \nII\u2019s incorporation of Section 504\u2019s remedies suggests \nthat the same rationales apply to Title II claims.2   \n \n2 Entry of an injunction ordering a covered entity to comply with \nits legal obligations under Title II or Section 504 does not raise the \nsame concerns that motivated the Court to adopt the deliberate- \nindifference standard for the private damages claims at issue in \nGebser and Davis.  Unlike damages, equitable relief does not impli-\ncate the Court\u2019s \u201ccentral concern\u201d when interpreting Spending \nClause statutes:  \u201cthat \u2018the receiving entity of federal funds has no-\ntice that it will be liable for a monetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 287 (brackets and citation omitted).  And unlike damages liability \n\n19 \n \nc. The deliberate-indifference intent requirement is \n\u201can exacting standard,\u201d J.S. v. Houston County Bd. of \nEduc., 877 F.3d 979, 987 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) \n(citation omitted), that ensures that entities cannot be \nheld liable for damages on account of mistakes, negli-\ngence, or bureaucratic inaction.  Similar to the analysis \nthis Court applied in Gebser and Davis, courts analyz-\ning Title II and Section 504 damages claims must ask \nwhether the evidence proves that the covered entity both \n\u201c(1) [had] knowledge that a federally protected right is \nsubstantially likely to be violated  * * *  and (2) fail[ed] \nto act despite that knowledge.\u201d  S.H., 729 F.3d at 265; \nsee Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229.  Ap-\nplication of the deliberate-indifference standard to Title \nII and Section 504 damages claims accordingly ensures \nthat regulated entities will have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that [they] will \nbe liable for a monetary award,\u2019\u200a\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 \n(citation omitted), and provides them with the neces-\nsary \u201cflexibility\u201d to implement their programs without \nfear of unexpected damages liability, Davis, 526 U.S. at \n648.   \nThe knowledge requirement demands \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d of the substantial likelihood of discrimination, \nGebser, 524 U.S. at 290, and does not generally allow \nimposition of damages liability based on what the de-\nfendant \u201cshould have known,\u201d Davis, 526 U.S. at 642.  \nSee, e.g., J.S., 877 F.3d at 989 (applying an \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d standard); Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (same).  And \nthe failure-to-act requirement requires proof of \u201ca  \n\u2018deliberate choice, rather than negligence or bureau-\ncratic inaction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (citation omit-\n \nfor past violations, a recipient of federal funds can avoid equitable \nrelief under the Rehabilitation Act by withdrawing from the federal \nfunding program.   \n\n20 \n \nted); see Liese, 701 F.3d at 344 (\u201c[D]eliberate indiffer-\nence plainly requires more than gross negligence.\u201d); \nJ.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 813 F.3d 1289, 1298 (10th \nCir. 2016) (\u201cThe failure to act must be \u2018more than negli-\ngent\u2019 and involve \u2018an element of deliberateness.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229 (similar);  \n1 Americans with Disabilities: Practice and Compli-\nance Manual \u00a7\u00a7 1:261, 2:222 (2d ed. 2024).  \u201c[D]eliber-\nate indifference does not occur where a duty to act may \nsimply have been overlooked, or a complaint may rea-\nsonably have been deemed to result from events taking \ntheir normal course\u201d; in other words, \u201cbureaucratic \nslippage that constitutes negligence\u201d is not deliberate \nindifference.  Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1139. \nB. Title II And Section 504 Claims Are Subject To The \nSame Intent Standards Inside And Outside The Educa-\ntional Context \nIn the decision below, the Eighth Circuit recognized \nthat, outside the context of elementary and secondary \neducation, defendants can be held liable under Title II \nand Section 504 based on their failure to make reasona-\nble accommodations, even absent proof of intentional \ndiscrimination.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  The question \npresented, as set forth in the petition for a writ of certi-\norari, asks whether \u201ca uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u2019 standard\u201d applies to disability- \ndiscrimination claims when plaintiffs \u201cseek[] relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education.\u201d  Pet. i (em-\nphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 brief in opposition does \nnot dispute that, outside of school settings, Section 504 \n\n21 \n \nof the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA do not \nrequire proof of intentional discrimination.3   \nThe Eighth Circuit nevertheless held that, \u201cwhen the \nalleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \u2018based on \neducational services for disabled children,\u2019 a school dis-\ntrict\u2019s simple failure to provide a reasonable accommo-\ndation is not enough to trigger liability.\u201d  Pet. App. 3a \n(citation omitted).  The court applied circuit precedents \nholding that, in the school setting, a plaintiff must prove \n\u201ceither bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d as well.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 5a n.2 (explaining that \nEighth Circuit precedents impose \u201ca high bar for claims \nbased on educational services\u201d even though the court \n\u201crequire[s] much less in other disability-discrimination \ncontexts\u201d).  Nothing in the text or purposes of Title II \nor Section 504 supports that approach.   \n1. The texts of Title II and Section 504 indicate that the \nsame intent standards apply inside and outside the \neducational context \nThe substantive terms of Title II and Section 504\u2014\nwhich include those provisions\u2019 primary bans on disabil-\nity discrimination\u2014do not apply differently in school \nsettings than they do elsewhere.  Title II provides that \n\u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or ac-\ntivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimina-\n \n3 Indeed, respondents state that this Court in Choate, supra, \n\u201cheld that conduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u2018fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30 (quoting Choate, \n469 U.S. at 297).  Respondents argue that \u201c[t]he \u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019 standard takes this instruction [from Choate] into ac-\ncount by proscribing intentional conduct, bad faith, in addition to \nunintentional yet harmful conduct, gross misjudgment.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n22 \n \ntion by any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  Section 504 \nprovides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability  * * *  shall, solely by reason of her or his dis-\nability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany\u201d covered program.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Both statu-\ntory provisions apply to any \u201cqualified individual,\u201d ibid.; \n42 U.S.C. 12132, and neither provision contains any lan-\nguage that distinguishes between educational and non-\neducational contexts (or between elementary and sec-\nondary schools, on the one hand, and colleges on the \nother, see Pet. Br. 43-44).   \nThe same is true of the two Acts\u2019 remedial provisions.  \nUnder the Rehabilitation Act, \u201c[t]he remedies, proce-\ndures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964,\u201d Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. \n2000d et seq.), \u201cshall be available to any person ag-\ngrieved by any act or failure to act by\u201d a federal funding \nrecipient.  29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2).  And \u201c[t]he remedies, \nprocedures, and rights set forth\u201d in the Rehabilitation \nAct are available \u201cto any person alleging discrimina-\ntion\u201d under Title II.  42 U.S.C. 12133.  Accordingly, the \nremedies under each Act are available to \u201cany person\u201d \n\u2014regardless of the setting in which she claims to have \nsuffered disability-based discrimination.  Ibid.; 29 U.S.C. \n794a(a)(2).   \nReading those provisions to require one level of in-\ntent for claims brought in the context of elementary and \nsecondary education, and a different level of intent for \nclaims brought outside that context, would run afoul of \nbasic statutory-interpretation principles.  When a stat-\nutory phrase \u201c\u200a\u2018applies without differentiation\u2019\u200a\u201d to \u201ctwo \ncategories,\u201d courts ordinarily give that phrase the same \nmeaning as applied to both categories.  Pasquantino v. \n\n23 \n \nUnited States, 544 U.S. 349, 358 (2005) (citation omit-\nted).  Because the Eighth Circuit\u2019s heightened intent \nrequirement gives the \u201csame words a different meaning \nfor each category,\u201d that reading would impermissibly \n\u201cinvent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d  Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 378 (2005); see United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality opinion) (not-\ning that the Court has \u201cnever engaged in [the] interpre-\ntive contortion\u201d of \u201cgiving the same word, in the same \nstatutory provision, different meanings in different \nfactual contexts\u201d). \n2. The statutory context supports reading Title II and \nSection 504 to impose the same intent standards in-\nside and outside the educational context  \nFor purposes of the question presented here, the \nonly salient difference between school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims, and other claims brought under \nthose statutes, is that the school-based claims poten-\ntially implicate the IDEA.  That difference, however, \nprovides no sound basis for the Eighth Circuit\u2019s height-\nened intent standard.  To the contrary, the larger stat-\nutory context\u2014which includes both the IDEA and the \ncongressionally articulated purposes of Title II and \nSection 504\u2014confirms that Title II and Section 504 \nclaims based on a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s treatment by an elementary \nor secondary school are governed by the same intent \nstandards that apply to all other Title II and Section 504 \nclaims. \na. The IDEA confirms that Title II and Section 504 \ndo not mean different things in different contexts.  Con-\ntra Br. in Opp. 27-30.  The IDEA provides that, with the \nexception of an exhaustion requirement that is not rel-\nevant here, \u201c[n]othing in\u201d the IDEA \u201cshall be construed \nto restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies \n\n24 \n \navailable under  * * *  the Americans with Disabilities \nAct\u201d or \u201cthe Rehabilitation Act.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).   \nCongress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA in order \nto overturn this Court\u2019s holding in Smith v. Robinson, \n468 U.S. 992 (1984).  In Smith, the Court held that the \nIDEA in its then-current form \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive ave-\nnue\u2019 through which a child with a disability (or his par-\nents) could challenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  \nThe Court accordingly held that the plaintiffs could not \ninvoke the Equal Protection Clause and Section 504  \nas alternative means of vindicating children\u2019s IDEA- \nprotected educational rights.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009-\n1013, 1016-1021. \nIn 1986, Congress responded by enacting the provi-\nsion that is \u201c[n]ow codified\u201d as Section 1415(l), which \n\u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA claims.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 161.  Section 1415(l) \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirm[ed] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA or Rehabilita-\ntion Act \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less integral than the \nIDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of handicapped chil-\ndren.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 296, 99th Cong., 1st \nSess. 4 (1985)).  And Section 1415(l) focused on \u201cremedies \nand relief,\u201d Luna Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, \n148 (2023); see id. at 147-150, making clear that \u201c[n]othing \nin\u201d the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or limit[s] the  * * *  remedies \navailable under\u201d Title II or Section 504, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  \nRequiring plaintiffs to meet a heightened intent re-\nquirement when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims \nin the context of elementary and secondary education \nwould \u201crestrict or limit\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cremedies,\u201d ibid., in plain contravention of the text of \nSection 1415(l). \n\n25 \n \nb. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s school-specific \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d requirement is likewise incon-\nsistent with the congressional purposes identified in the \nrelevant statutory texts.  The Rehabilitation Act seeks \nto maximize the \u201cinclusion and integration into society\u201d \nof individuals with disabilities, including by integrating \nindividuals into the \u201ceducational mainstream of Ameri-\ncan society.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F) and (b)(1); see 29 \nU.S.C. 701(a)(5), (a)(6)(B), and (c)(3).  As already noted, \nwhen it enacted the Rehabilitation Act, Congress \u201cper-\nceived\u201d that \u201c[d]iscrimination against the handicapped \nwas  * * *  most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014\nof benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295.  And sub-\nsequent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act \u201creflec-\nted Congress\u2019 concern with protecting the handicapped \nagainst discrimination stemming not only from simple \nprejudice, but also from \u2018archaic attitudes and laws\u2019 and \nfrom \u2018the fact that the American people [we]re simply \nunfamiliar with and insensitive to the difficulties con-\nfronting individuals with handicaps.\u2019\u200a\u201d  School Bd. of \nNassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 279 (1987) (quo-\nting S. Rep. No. 1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1974)) \n(brackets omitted).   \nCongress enacted Title II of the ADA to extend the \nanti-discrimination principle in the Rehabilitation Act \nbeyond executive-branch agencies and recipients of fed-\neral funds.  See Berardelli v. Allied Servs. Inst. of Re-\nhab. Med., 900 F.3d 104, 115 (3d Cir. 2018); see also Fry, \n580 U.S. at 159-160, 170-171 (noting that Title II and \nSection 504 have substantially similar purposes and cov-\nerage).  The ADA accordingly seeks to further the \u201cgoals\u201d \nof \u201cassur[ing] equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency,\u201d  \n\n26 \n \n42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7), including in the educational con-\ntext, see 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) and (6).   \nRequiring students to make a showing of heightened \nintent when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims in \nthe school context would undermine the goals of max-\nimizing students\u2019 \u201cinclusion and integration\u201d in educa-\ntional institutions and of \u201cassur[ing] equality of\u200a\u201d educa-\ntional \u201copportunity.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F); 42 U.S.C. \n12101(a)(7).  Differential treatment of such claims \nwould be particularly inappropriate because both stat-\nutes expressly acknowledge the importance of curbing \ndisability-based discrimination in \u201ceducation\u201d alongside \nnumerous other situations in which such discrimination \nmay occur.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) (congres-\nsional finding that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities persists in such critical areas as em-\nployment, housing, public accommodations, education, \ntransportation, communication, recreation, institution-\nalization, health services, voting, and access to public \nservices\u201d); 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(5) (\u201c[I]ndividuals with disa-\nbilities continually encounter various forms of discrimi-\nnation in such critical areas as employment, housing, \npublic accommodations, education, transportation, com-\nmunication, recreation, institutionalization, health ser-\nvices, voting, and public services.\u201d).  Applying different \nintent standards inside and outside the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education would undermine \nCongress\u2019s choice to bar even discrimination that arises \nout of \u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d \u201cindifference,\u201d and \u201cbenign ne-\nglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295; cf. Liese, 701 F.3d at 348.  \n\n27 \n \n3. The Eighth Circuit and respondents have identified \nno sound basis for applying a heightened intent  \nrequirement to disability-discrimination claims in \nthe context of elementary and secondary education \nThe Eighth Circuit identified no sound basis for ap-\nplying a heightened \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard to ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought \nin the school context.  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise \nlack merit.   \na. The courts of appeals that apply a \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard to Title II and Section \n504 claims in the educational context have identified no \nsound basis for that heightened standard.  As the court \nof appeals recognized here, Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2, the \nheightened standard originated in its decision in Mo-\nnahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. \ndenied, 460 U.S. 1012 (1983).  In Monahan, the court \naffirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 and \nIDEA claims, which alleged infirmities in the State\u2019s \nprocess for reviewing educational placement decisions.  \nId. at 1167-1168.  The court found that the IDEA claim \nwas moot because it was premised on a challenge to a \nstate law that had been amended since the plaintiffs \nfiled their complaints.  Id. at 1168.  The court further \nfound that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims of violation of \n[Section] 504 seem to rest on the same procedural theo-\nries that plaintiffs have unsuccessfully urged under [the \nIDEA],\u201d dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 claims \nwas appropriate as well.  Id. at 1170. \nAfter reaching that conclusion, the Eighth Circuit \n\u201cadd[ed] a few words for the guidance of the District \nCourt and the parties\u201d in the event the plaintiffs \u201cre-\nfil[ed]  * * *  a new complaint.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at \n1170.  The court stated that a plaintiff must prove \u201cei-\n\n28 \n \nther bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to \u201cshow[]\u201d a Sec-\ntion 504 \u201cviolation  * * *  at least in the context of edu-\ncation of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  The court \nviewed such a standard as necessary because \u201c[t]he Re-\nhabilitation Act and [the IDEA] are entirely different \nstatutes\u201d; because the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard would \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \nintended by Congress\u201d; and because the intent require-\nment would \u201cproper[ly] balance  * * *  the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state edu-\ncation officials, and the competence of courts to make \njudgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id. at 1170-1171. \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d stand-\nard had no basis in the then-current text of the Rehabil-\nitation Act.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  And Congress\u2019s sub-\nsequent addition of Section 1415(l) to the IDEA con-\nfirms the impropriety of imposing uniquely stringent \nrequirements for school-based disability-discrimination \nclaims.  Two years after the Eighth Circuit decided Mo-\nnahan, this Court similarly read Section 504 and the \nIDEA to cover separate ground, holding that the IDEA \nwas \u201cthe exclusive avenue\u201d for challenging the ade-\nquacy of a child\u2019s education.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009; \nsee p. 24, supra.  Congress promptly rejected that ap-\nproach, however, by enacting Section 1415(l), which \nprovides that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be con-\nstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and \nremedies available under\u201d Title II and Section 504.  20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l); see pp. 6-7, 23-24, supra.  By imposing a \nheightened intent requirement only on Section 504 \nclaims that arise \u201cin the context of education of\u200a\u201d chil-\ndren with disabilities, 687 F.2d at 1171, Monahan read \nthe IDEA to \u201climit the rights\u201d and \u201cremedies available \nunder\u201d the Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l)\u2014an in-\n\n29 \n \nterpretation that is now expressly foreclosed by Section \n1415(l). \nb. Respondents\u2019 defense of Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard fares no better. \ni. Respondents have observed (Br. in Opp. 26) that \npetitioner\u2019s private rights of action under Title II and \nSection 504 stem from the judicially implied cause of ac-\ntion under Title VI.  Respondents contend that this Court \ntherefore has a \u201cmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible \nremedial scheme that best comports with the statute.\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  Re-\nspondents further claim (Br. in Opp. 27) that the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standard \u201cis an appropriate exer-\ncise of that discretion\u201d because Title II and Section 504 \nclaims in the educational context may overlap with \nIDEA claims and touch on educational policy.  Given the \nrelief available under the IDEA, plaintiffs who allege \ndisability-based discrimination in elementary and sec-\nondary schools may less often have a practical need to \ninvoke the remedies that Title II and Section 504 pro-\nvide.  There is no sound basis, however, for applying a \ndifferent legal standard to school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims than to other claims brought under \nthose statutes. \nIn Gebser, this Court recognized that, \u201c[b]ecause the \nprivate right of action under Title IX is judicially im-\nplied,\u201d no statutory language specifies the standard \nthat governs damages claims under that law.  524 U.S. \nat 284.  The Court explained that, when \u201cshap[ing] a \nsensible remedial scheme that best comports with the \nstatute,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] the relevant statute to \nensure that [the Court does] not fashion the scope of an \nimplied right in a manner at odds with the statutory \nstructure and purpose.\u201d  Ibid.  Applying that analysis \n\n30 \n \nhere, the statutory text, structure, context, and purpose \nall point in the same direction:  Congress intended Title \nII and Section 504 to apply fully in the educational con-\ntext, even if claims under those statutes sometimes \noverlap with IDEA claims.  See pp. 21-26, supra.  In-\ndeed, Congress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA to \nrepudiate the inference that this overlap in coverage \nshould affect Title II\u2019s and Section 504\u2019s application to \nschool-based claims.  See pp. 23-24, supra. \nThere is consequently no basis in the \u201cstatutory \nstructure\u201d or \u201cpurpose,\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284, for the \neducation-specific intent requirement that the Monahan \ncourt adopted.  And it would \u201cfrustrate the purposes\u201d of \nTitle II and Section 504, id. at 285\u2014which seek to elimi-\nnate disability-based discrimination equally within and \noutside the educational context, see pp. 25-26, supra\u2014\nto apply a heightened intent standard solely to school-\nbased claims.   \nii. Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that the \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is more con-\nsistent with the Court\u2019s statement in Choate that \u201cmuch \nof the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing \nthe Rehabilitation Act would be difficult if not impossi-\nble to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only \nconduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  469 U.S. at \n296-297.  In respondents\u2019 view, \u201cthe \u2018deliberate indiffer-\nence\u2019 standard\u201d is less consistent with Choate because \nit \u201cstill requires discriminatory intent.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30-\n31; see p. 21 n.3, supra.  But Choate, which involved a \nclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief, discussed \nonly the requirements for proving disability discrimina-\ntion, see 469 U.S. at 289, 292-299; it did not discuss the \nrequirements for obtaining damages, which all agree in-\nclude a showing of intent, see Br. in Opp. 26. \n\n31 \n \nIn briefly defending the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudg-\nment\u201d standard, respondents appear to contend (Br. in \nOpp. 31-32) that the standard applies to all Title II and \nSection 504 claims, not simply to those that involve ele-\nmentary and secondary education.  But no court of ap-\npeals has adopted that view, and the decision below \nmade clear that the court viewed the standard as a height-\nened intent requirement that applies only to school-\nbased claims.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  And respond-\nents\u2019 argument is not directly responsive to the question \npresented in the petition for a writ of certiorari, which \nasks this Court to consider whether \u201cchildren with dis-\nabilities\u201d must \u201csatisfy a uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u2019 standard when seeking relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education\u201d under Title \nII or Section 504.  Pet. i (emphasis added); see p. 20, \nsupra. \niii.  Respondents observe (Br. in Opp. 31) that Con-\ngress enacted Section 1415(l) to overturn this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Smith, and that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision \nin Monahan is \u201cdistinct\u201d from Smith.  To be sure, the \nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Monahan was less restric-\ntive than this Court\u2019s decision in Smith, because the \nEighth Circuit announced a heightened intent standard \nfor school-based Title II and Section 504 claims but did \nnot hold that such claims are entirely foreclosed.  But \nwhile Smith was the immediate impetus for Congress\u2019s \nenactment of Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s reasoning and \nits \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard are sim-\nilarly inconsistent with Section 1415(l)\u2019s plain text.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nadopted in Monahan reflected the Eighth Circuit\u2019s at-\ntempt \u201cto harmonize the Rehabilitation Act and the \n[IDEA] to the fullest extent possible.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  \n\n32 \n \nBut Section 1415(l) now expressly provides that \n\u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder\u201d Title II or Section 504.  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  That \nlanguage \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirms the viability\u2019 of federal statutes \nlike the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \u2018as separate vehi-\ncles,\u2019 no less integral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the \nrights of handicapped children.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 \n(brackets and citation omitted).  Congress thus disap-\nproved of efforts to invoke the IDEA\u2019s remedial scheme \nas a justification for narrowing the coverage of Title II \nor Section 504.  Respondents are correct that \u201cSection \n1415(l) does not  * * *  opine on the standard governing\u201d \nclaims under those statutes.  Br. in Opp. 31.  But Section \n1415(l) clearly indicates that the same intent standards \n\u2014both for liability and for damages\u2014should govern \nschool-based and non-school-based Title II and Section \n504 claims.   \niv.  Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 28) that applying \nthe deliberate-indifference standard \u201cwould open the \ndoor for plaintiffs to end-run the statutorily prescribed \nIEP process.\u201d  But regardless of the applicable intent \nstandard, a plaintiff who wishes to bring Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 claims must first comply with Section 1415(l)\u2019s \nadministrative-exhaustion requirement whenever that \nrequirement applies.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (explain-\ning that \u201cthe second half of [Section] 1415(l)  * * *  im-\nposes a limit  * * *  in the form of an exhaustion provi-\nsion\u201d on Section 1415(l)\u2019s general rule that Title II and \nSection 504 claims are unaffected by the IDEA); id. at \n165 (summarizing the analysis used to determine \nwhether Section 1415(l)\u2019s exhaustion requirement ap-\nplies to a particular claim).  Indeed, Section 1415(l)\u2019s ex-\nplicit directive that ADA and Rehabilitation Act plain-\n\n33 \n \ntiffs must satisfy the IDEA\u2019s exhaustion requirement \nprovides further evidence that school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims are not subject to any other education-\nspecific restrictions.   \nRespondents also contend that a heightened intent \nrequirement is necessary to avoid \u201cinhibit[ing] the abil-\nity of schools and parents to \u2018work cooperatively to find \nthe best education placement and services for the \nchild.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Op. 28 (brackets and citation omitted).  \nBut as explained above, see pp. 19-20, supra, schools \ncannot be held liable for damages when they merely \nmake mistakes, act negligently, or engage in bureau-\ncratic inaction that delays the delivery of services.  The \ndeliberate-indifference standard correctly respects the \nbalance Congress struck in Title II and Section 504:  It \npermits damages claims against covered entities that \nengage in disability discrimination, but only where they \nhave \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of a substantial likelihood \u201cof \ndiscrimination in the recipient\u2019s programs\u201d and yet re-\nspond with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 290.  In any event, respondents\u2019 policy arguments \ncannot override the plain text of the provisions that \nCongress enacted, which provide no basis for imposing \ndifferent intent requirements for school-based and non-\nschool-based Title II and Section 504 claims.  See 14 \nPenn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 270 (2009) (\u201cWe \ncannot rely on [a] judicial policy concern as a source of \nauthority for introducing a qualification into the [stat-\nute] that is not found in its text.\u201d). \n\n34 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated, and the case should be remanded for further pro-\nceedings.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nTHOMAS WHEELER \nActing General Counsel \nJOSHUA S.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for certiorari. While not the full merits brief I was anticipating, the BIO is a critical document that provides the first detailed look at the Respondent's legal strategy and core arguments. It fills the major knowledge gap I had previously identified, allowing me to move from speculating about the Respondent's defense to analyzing their stated positions. My substantive task beliefs (\u03b8) are significantly refined and updated.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Re-contextualized):** This belief remains foundational. However, the BIO reveals the arguments that were marshaled *against* granting cert, which the Court ultimately rejected. The Respondent argued there was no \"meaningful circuit split\" (just different \"verbal formulations\") and that this case was a \"poor vehicle.\" The Court's decision to take the case *despite* these arguments signals that a majority of justices likely perceive the split as real and the vehicle as adequate to resolve the important legal question presented.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Corroborated):** This belief is stable. The BIO's arguments confirm that the central battleground is exactly where the Petitioner and Solicitor General have staked it: the plain text of the ADA and Section 504 versus a judicially-created standard.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Architecture Revealed (Belief Massively Updated and Specified):** My previous, more abstract understanding of the Respondent's defense is now replaced with a concrete, multi-part legal theory drawn directly from their BIO. The defense is more sophisticated than simply \"deference to educators.\"\n    *   **Argument 1: Reframe the Standard as a \"Sensible Remedial Scheme.\"** The Respondent is not defending the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard as being *in the text*. Instead, they frame it as a judicially-created \"sensible remedial scheme\" that is appropriate for an implied cause of action, citing the Court's decision in *Gebser v. Largo Vista*. They argue this is necessary to handle the \"conceptual peculiarity\" of ADA/Rehabilitation Act claims that are based on the denial of IDEA services. This positions their argument as consistent with a line of precedent where the Court has filled in remedial gaps, directly countering the Petitioner's pure textualist approach.\n    *   **Argument 2: Deny the Circuit Split.** The Respondent argues that all circuits agree on a \"high\" intent standard and that differences in wording do not lead to different outcomes. They claim there is *no* split at all regarding the standard for injunctive relief. This is an attempt to undermine the primary justification for the Court's review.\n    *   **Argument 3: Attack the Vehicle.** The Respondent argues that the facts of this specific case are poor for resolving the legal question. They emphasize the District's \"persistent efforts\" and the fact that the petitioner already received relief in a separate action, suggesting a ruling here would have little practical effect for A.J.T. This is a pragmatic appeal to the Court to avoid making a broad ruling on a messy factual record.\n    *   **Argument 4: Invoke Deference and History.** The Respondent explicitly defends the 40-year-old *Monahan* standard as the correct way to balance the ADA's prohibitions with the necessary deference to the \"expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.\"\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Clash of Interpretive Models (Belief Sharpened and Nuanced):** The core conflict is now exceptionally clear. It is a battle between two competing interpretive frameworks, each supported by a line of Supreme Court precedent:\n    *   **The Petitioner/SG Framework (*Perez* Model):** The ADA and Section 504 have clear, unambiguous text. The IDEA's savings clause, as interpreted in *Perez v. Sturgis*, means those statutes apply on their own terms, without any special, atextual \"education exception.\" The Court's job is simply to apply the text as written.\n    *   **The Respondent Framework (*Gebser* Model):** The ADA/Rehabilitation Act claims in the special education context are a \"unique\" type of claim with an implied right of action. Therefore, under the logic of *Gebser*, courts have the authority to craft a \"sensible remedial scheme\"\u2014the *Monahan* standard\u2014that balances the statutory goals with practical realities and the need for deference to educators.\n    The case will likely turn on which model the Court finds more applicable to this specific statutory intersection.\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention as a Decisive Predictive Signal (Belief Stable, but Counter-Narrative Identified):** The SG's support for the Petitioner remains a powerful signal. However, the Respondent's BIO provides the direct counter-narrative. The Respondent will argue that the SG's proposed \"deliberate indifference\" standard is being improperly imported from other contexts (like Title IX) and fails to account for the unique statutory structure of IDEA, which already has its own comprehensive remedial process.\n\n6.  **Analysis Becomes Two-Sided; Confidence Remains High but Tempered (Meta-Belief Updated):** The major knowledge gap is now filled. I have a clear view of both sides' core legal theories. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome remains high, primarily because the Court granted cert over the Respondent's objections and the textualist arguments of the Petitioner and SG align with the Court's recent trends (*Perez*). However, my confidence is now tempered. The Respondent's reliance on the *Gebser* line of cases presents a plausible, alternative legal framework, not just a policy argument. Furthermore, the hiring of Lisa Blatt, an elite and highly respected Supreme Court advocate, as counsel for the Respondent is a new and significant signal that these arguments will be presented in the most persuasive way possible. The burden on the Respondent is high, but their legal strategy is coherent and grounded in precedent, making the outcome less of a foregone conclusion and more of a genuine clash of judicial philosophies.",

This significantly strengthens the petitioner's case and provides the Court with a clear path to rule in their favor. However, my model of the case is incomplete without the respondent's counter-arguments. I must understand how the school district defends the existing standard against the strong textual and structural arguments from the petitioner and the SG.

More importantly, it explicitly identifies the most significant remaining uncertainty: the Respondent's direct counter-arguments to the powerful Petitioner/SG framework. By formulating a precise, improved search plan to acquire the Respondent's merits brief, this action is the necessary precursor to the single most informative observation remaining at this stage. It sharpens the analytical question from 'What will the Respondent argue?' to 'How will the Respondent defend the 'gross misjudgment' standard against the SG's specific 'deliberate indifference' proposal?' This reframing is a significant update to the agent's internal model.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action demonstrates a crucial, generalizable strategy for robust prediction: actively seeking disconfirming evidence. After receiving a powerful signal (the SG brief) that heavily favors one side, the agent correctly prioritizes finding the direct rebuttal to avoid confirmation bias and build a complete, two-sided model of the legal conflict. The tactical element of diagnosing a failed search and planning a more precise, filtered query is also a valuable, reusable procedural lesson. This process of identifying and systematically filling the most critical argumentative gap is a cornerstone of effective BOED in this domain.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the full merits-stage amicus brief from the United States Solicitor General (SG), filed in support of the Petitioner. This is a highly significant development. My search was for amicus briefs supporting the *Respondent*, but the result yielded the detailed argument from the U.S. government *against* the Respondent's position. This brief moves beyond the general support expressed at the cert stage and provides a specific, comprehensive legal framework that the government urges the Court to adopt. It fills in the details of the strongest anti-Respondent argument and provides a direct, preemptive rebuttal to the defense strategy I previously inferred from the Respondent's BIO.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Reinforced):** This belief remains foundational. The filing of a detailed merits-stage amicus brief by the Solicitor General, representing the Departments of Justice and Education, underscores the government's view that the circuit split over the intent standard for disability discrimination in schools is untenable and requires a definitive resolution from the Court.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Massively Elaborated):** This belief is stable, but the SG's brief provides the authoritative government blueprint for this assault. The argument is now understood not just as a general textualist claim, but as a specific, two-tiered proposal for liability and damages.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Architecture is Under Direct Attack (Belief Stable, but Counter-Arguments Crystallized):** My understanding of the Respondent's defense (relying on *Gebser*, deference to educators, and the *Monahan* standard) remains the same. However, the SG's brief provides a point-by-point pre-rebuttal to this entire framework, significantly clarifying the legal battle lines. The SG directly argues that the Respondent's reliance on *Monahan* and *Gebser* is misplaced and that there is \"no sound basis\" for a special, heightened intent requirement in the education context.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Clash of Interpretive Models (Belief Sharpened and Specified):** The core conflict is now exceptionally clear and can be defined with much greater precision.\n    *   **The Petitioner/SG Framework (*Perez* Model + *Davis* Standard):** This framework has been fully fleshed out by the SG's brief. It is no longer just about plain text. The SG proposes a specific, two-part standard:\n        *   **For Establishing a Violation:** A plaintiff need *not* prove any discriminatory intent. The plain text of the ADA/Section 504, which prohibits discrimination \"by reason of\" disability, is sufficient. This allows for claims based on failure to provide reasonable accommodations, without needing to prove the school acted in \"bad faith.\"\n        *   **For Recovering Compensatory Damages:** A plaintiff *must* prove intentional discrimination, which can be satisfied by showing **\"deliberate indifference\"** to the student's federally protected rights. The SG explicitly imports this standard from the Court's Title IX jurisprudence (*Davis v. Monroe County*).\n    *   **The Respondent Framework (*Gebser* Model + *Monahan* Standard):** This framework remains as previously understood: ADA/Section 504 claims in the education context are unique, allowing courts under *Gebser* to craft a \"sensible remedial scheme\"\u2014the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard from *Monahan*\u2014to protect educator discretion.\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention as a Decisive Predictive Signal (Belief Massively Updated and Specified):** This belief has evolved from a general signal to a specific, substantive pillar of the prediction. The SG is not merely supporting the Petitioner; it is providing the Court with a well-defined, workable legal standard to adopt as a nationwide rule. The key arguments from the SG's brief are:\n    *   **Text and Structure:** The ADA and Section 504 do not contain different language for schools versus other public entities. Therefore, the standards for proving a violation should be uniform.\n    *   **The IDEA Savings Clause:** Citing *Luna Perez v. Sturgis*, the SG argues that 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l) explicitly preserves the \"rights, procedures, and remedies\" of the ADA and Section 504, precluding courts from inventing a special, more difficult standard just because the discrimination relates to education.\n    *   **The Correct Standard for Damages:** The SG argues that \"deliberate indifference\" is the appropriate standard for damages because it correctly balances the need to compensate victims of intentional discrimination with the need to protect schools from liability for \"mere mistakes or negligence.\" This directly counters the Respondent's claim that a high bar is needed to prevent a flood of litigation.\n\n6.  **Analysis Becomes Two-Sided, but the Scales Have Tipped (Meta-Belief Updated):** While I still have a clear view of both sides' arguments, the SG's merits brief significantly strengthens the Petitioner's position. It provides the Court with a clear, precedented, and government-endorsed \"off-ramp\" from the messy circuit split. The proposed \"deliberate indifference\" standard is familiar to the Court and lower courts, making it an attractive alternative to the amorphous \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome has increased substantially. The Respondent and their elite counsel now face the difficult task of not only defending the *Monahan* standard but also convincing the Court to reject a detailed, text-based, and structurally coherent alternative proposed by the U.S. government itself. The fact that a search for amicus briefs supporting the Respondent has so far come up empty, while the Petitioner has the full-throated support of the SG, is another signal, albeit a tentative one, that the weight of institutional opinion may be consolidating against the Eighth Circuit's standard.",

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was a record of my own internal reasoning, a \"THINK\" step. It contained no new external information, evidence, or legal arguments regarding the case. It served as a self-correction and planning step, acknowledging that while the Solicitor General's (SG) brief provided a powerful argument for the Petitioner, my understanding of the case remains incomplete without the Respondent's counter-arguments.\n\nTherefore, my cumulative beliefs remain stable, carried forward from the analysis of the SG's brief. The THINK step reinforces the importance of the knowledge gap I have already identified.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Reinforced):** This foundational belief is unchanged. The SG's merits-stage intervention continues to be the strongest signal of the case's significance.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable and Elaborated):** My understanding of the Petitioner's argument, as fully fleshed out by the SG's brief, remains the same. It is a specific, two-tiered proposal for liability and damages that the Court can adopt.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Architecture is Under Direct Attack (Belief Stable, but Awaiting Rebuttal):** My model of the Respondent's likely defense (based on *Gebser*, deference to educators, and the *Monahan* standard) is stable. The SG's brief provides a comprehensive pre-rebuttal to this defense. The critical missing piece of information, highlighted by the recent THINK step, is the Respondent's actual merits brief, which will show how they counter the powerful arguments from the Petitioner and the United States.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Clash of Interpretive Models (Belief Sharpened and Stable):** The core conflict remains exceptionally clear and is the central pillar of my predictive model.\n    *   **The Petitioner/SG Framework (*Perez* Model + *Davis* Standard):** This framework, detailed in the SG's brief, proposes a two-part standard: (1) No intent required to prove a statutory violation (e.g., failure to accommodate); (2) \"Deliberate indifference\" required to recover compensatory damages. This remains the strongest proposed alternative to the status quo in the split circuits.\n    *   **The Respondent Framework (*Gebser* Model + *Monahan* Standard):** This framework, which I anticipate the Respondent will defend, argues that the unique context of education justifies a judicially crafted, heightened standard of \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" to protect educator discretion.\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention as a Decisive Predictive Signal (Belief Stable):** The SG's merits brief remains the most significant predictive signal thus far. It provides the Court with a well-defined, government-endorsed, and textually grounded legal standard (\"deliberate indifference\") that is familiar from other contexts (*Davis v. Monroe County*). This provides a clear \"off-ramp\" from the circuit split.\n\n6.  **Analysis Becomes Two-Sided, but the Scales Have Tipped (Meta-Belief Stable and Reinforced):** My confidence remains tilted in favor of a pro-Petitioner outcome due to the strength and source of the arguments supporting reversal. The recent THINK observation did not alter the weight of the evidence I have seen, but it did underscore the asymmetry of my current knowledge. I have a deep understanding of the Petitioner's and SG's position but only an inferred understanding of the Respondent's. The next crucial step is to acquire and analyze the Respondent's merits brief to see how they defend the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard against the formidable textual, structural, and precedential arguments arrayed against it. My current prediction is contingent on the strength of that forthcoming defense.",

This action directly probes the strength and breadth of the Petitioner's position by revealing their allies and arguments. \n\nTask EIG is high (0.8) because the identity of the amici (e.g., disability groups, states, former officials) and the substance of their arguments can significantly shift my assessment. They may provide empirical data to counter the Respondent's 'flood of litigation' fears, offer novel legal theories, or reframe the facts to neutralize the 'poor vehicle' argument. This information is crucial for weighing the persuasiveness of the Petitioner's side against the Respondent's newly illuminated and formidable defense. \n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action provides a classic case study in the strategic role of amicus briefs. It will allow me to refine my model of how different forms of influence\u2014the Solicitor General, elite private counsel, and broad interest-group coalitions\u2014interact and counterbalance each other in a statutory interpretation case.

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Proof of discriminatory intent is not required to \ndemonstrate a violation of Title II or Section 504,  \nbut such proof is required to recover damages \nunder those provisions .................................................... 12 \n1. To establish a violation of Title II or Section \n504, a plaintiff need not prove that the \ndefendant intended to engage in disability \ndiscrimination ............................................................ 13 \n2. To obtain compensatory damages for Title II \nand Section 504 violations, a plaintiff must \nprove intentional discrimination, which may be \nshown by proving deliberate indifference .............. 15 \nB. Title II and Section 504 claims are subject to the \nsame intent standards inside and outside the \neducational context.......................................................... 20 \n1. The texts of Title II and Section 504 indicate \nthat the same intent standards apply inside and \noutside the educational context ............................... 21 \n2. The statutory context supports reading Title II \nand Section 504 to impose the same intent stan-\ndards inside and outside the educational context ... 23 \n3.

Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act bars such discrimination by federal fund-\ning recipients.  Those provisions broadly prohibit dis-\ncrimination in all covered locations and against all cov-\nered persons\u2014including discrimination in schools and \ndiscrimination against students. \nCourts of appeals have generally held that plaintiffs \nmay establish liability under Title II and Section 504 by \nproving that they were discriminated against by a cov-\nered entity.  And they have required plaintiffs seeking \ncompensatory damages to prove discriminatory intent, \nwhich plaintiffs can do by establishing that a defendant \nacted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs\u2019  \nfederally protected rights.  Those requirements are  \ncorrect:  They are consistent with the relevant statutory \ntexts and with this Court\u2019s interpretation of similar \nlaws.  The deliberate-indifference requirement in par-\n\n3 \n \nticular ensures that schools will not face damages liabil-\nity for mere mistakes or negligence.   \nSome courts of appeals, however, including the Eighth \nCircuit in the decision below, have held that Title II and \nSection 504 plaintiffs who allege disability discrimina-\ntion in the context of elementary or secondary educa-\ntion must make an additional showing.  To establish a \ndefendant\u2019s liability in those courts, such plaintiffs must \nprove that the covered entity acted with \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d  That requirement has no basis in \nthe text of Title II or Section 504.  Those statutory pro-\nvisions do not distinguish between educational and non-\neducational settings, neither when prohibiting discrim-\nination nor when specifying remedies.  The broader \nstatutory context likewise provides no basis for that \nheightened intent requirement.  Because the court of ap-\npeals based its decision on petitioner\u2019s failure to satisfy \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard, its judg-\nment should be vacated, and the case should be re-\nmanded for further proceedings.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Reha-\nbilitation Act \u201caim to root out disability-based discrimi-\nnation, enabling each covered person  * * *  to partici-\npate equally to all others in public facilities and feder-\nally funded programs.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Community \nSch., 580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  Both statutes prohibit \ndiscrimination against \u201cadults and children with disabil-\nities, in both public schools and other settings.\u201d  Id. at \n159.  And they both \u201cauthorize individuals to seek re-\ndress for violations of their substantive guarantees by \nbringing suits for injunctive relief or [compensatory] \nmoney damages.\u201d  Id. at 160. \n\n4 \n \nSpecifically, Title II of the ADA provides that \u201cno \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activi-\nties of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  It defines a \u201cpub-\nlic entity\u201d as including any instrumentality of a State or \nlocal government.  42 U.S.C. 12131(1)(B).   \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recip-\nients of federal financial assistance from discriminating \nbased on disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Phrased much \nlike Title II, Section 504 provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability  * * *  shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be sub-\njected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  Ibid.; see 28 \nC.F.R. 41.51(a); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(a).  Section 504 served \nas the model for Title II of the ADA, and the same lia-\nbility standards generally apply under both statutes.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12201(a); cf. Fry, 580 U.S. at 159 \n(noting that the two statutes impose the \u201csame prohibi-\ntion\u201d). \n2. The IDEA (formerly known as the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-\n172, 89 Stat. 773) provides federal grants to States \u201cto \nassist them to provide special education and related ser-\nvices to children with disabilities.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(1).  \nStates and school districts receiving IDEA funds must \nmake a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE) \n\u201cavailable\u201d to every eligible child \u201cwith [a] disabilit[y] \nresiding in the State.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)(A); see 20 \nU.S.C. 1401(9) (defining FAPE).   \n\n5 \n \nAs the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d of the IDEA\u2019s procedural pro-\ntections, a school district must provide each eligible child \nwith an \u201c\u200a\u2018individualized education[] program\u2019\u200a\u201d (IEP).  \nHonig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988).  An IEP must \nestablish a program of special education and related \nservices that is designed to meet the child\u2019s \u201cunique \nneeds.\u201d  Ibid.; see 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(4) (defining IEP); \nsee also 20 U.S.C. 1414(d); 34 C.F.R. 300.22, 300.34. \nThe IDEA prescribes procedures by which a stu-\ndent\u2019s parents can seek administrative and judicial re-\nview of a school district\u2019s IDEA-related determinations.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. 1415(f\u200a)-(\u200aj); School Comm. of Burlington \nv. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 368-369 (1985).  If \na dispute with the school district cannot be resolved un-\nder established procedures, the parents may obtain re-\nview by a state or local educational agency.  20 U.S.C. \n1415(f\u200a) and (g).  \nA party aggrieved by an agency decision under the \nIDEA may file a civil action in federal district court, 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(i)(2)(A), and the court may \u201cgrant such re-\nlief as the court determines is appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  This Court and the courts of appeals \nhave generally held that the \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201crelief\u200a\u201d au-\nthorized by the IDEA, ibid., is equitable in nature and \nencompasses both (1) future special education and re-\nlated services that ensure a FAPE or redress past de-\nnials of a FAPE, and (2) financial compensation to re-\nimburse parents for past educational expenditures that \nthe State should have borne.  See, e.g., Burlington, 471 \nU.S. at 369-370; Polera v. Board of Educ. of the New-\nburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 486 (2d \nCir. 2002); Charlie F. v. Board of Educ. of Skokie Sch. \nDist. 68, 98 F.3d 989, 992-993 (7th Cir. 1996), abrogated \nin part not relevant by Fry, 580 U.S. 154.  This Court \n\n6 \n \nhas distinguished such relief from compensatory \u201cdam-\nages,\u201d Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370, which the IDEA \ndoes \u201cnot allow,\u201d Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., \n555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); cf. Luna Perez v. Sturgis \nPub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, 148 (2023) (noting that \u201cevery-\none agrees\u201d that the \u201cIDEA does not provide\u201d \u201cfor com-\npensatory damages\u201d). \n3. The different rights, procedures, and remedies \nunder the IDEA on the one hand, and the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act on the other, reflect the distinct pur-\nposes that those statutes serve.  \u201c[T]he IDEA guaran-\ntees individually tailored educational services, while Ti-\ntle II and [Section] 504 promise non-discriminatory ac-\ncess to public institutions.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170-171.  \nAlthough \u201csome overlap in coverage\u201d exists, such that \n\u201c[t]he same conduct might violate all three statutes,\u201d id. \nat 171, the three laws contemplate different claims with \ndifferent proof requirements and different available \nremedies.   \nIn Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), this Court \nheld that the IDEA \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive avenue\u2019 through \nwhich a child with a disability (or his parents) could \nchallenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  Two years \nlater, Congress responded by enacting an IDEA provi-\nsion that \u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA \nclaims.\u201d  Id. at 161.  That provision, now codified at 20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l), reads as follows: \nNothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies availa-\nble under the Constitution, the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990  * * * , title V of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973  * * * , or other Federal laws protect-\ning the rights of children with disabilities, except \n\n7 \n \nthat before the filing of a civil action under such laws \nseeking relief that is also available under this sub-\nchapter, [state and local administrative] procedures  \n* * *  shall be exhausted to the same extent as would \nbe required had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter [of the IDEA]. \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l). \nSince Congress enacted Section 1415(l), this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that the IDEA is not the ex-\nclusive avenue by which a student with a disability can \nchallenge the adequacy of her education.  Rather, as \nlong as a plaintiff bringing a covered claim complies with \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement, \nthe IDEA does not preclude or limit claims brought un-\nder other laws.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 157-161, 165-176; \nLuna Perez, 598 U.S. at 146-151.   \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Petitioner has a rare and severe form of epilepsy.  \nPet. App. 2a, 50a.  She has seizures throughout the day \nand needs assistance with everyday tasks.  Id. at 50a.  \nIn the mornings her seizures are so frequent that she is \nunable to attend school before noon, but she is then \nalert and able to learn until 6 p.m.  Ibid.  Petitioner pre-\nviously attended school in Kentucky where, as part of \nher IEP, she received instruction from noon until 6 p.m. \neach school day, with some of that instruction occurring \nat home.  Id. at 8a.  That gave her the same number of \ninstructional hours as her peers without disabilities.  \nIbid.   \nIn 2015, petitioner moved to the Osseo Area School \nDistrict in Minnesota.  Pet. App. 49a-50a.  Although the \nDistrict (one of respondents here) created an IEP for \npetitioner, it repeatedly denied petitioner\u2019s requests for \nafter-hours instruction, which would have allowed her \n\n8 \n \nto receive the same number of instructional hours as her \npeers.  Id. at 8a-12a, 50a-51a.  In denying petitioner\u2019s \nrequests, the District offered \u201ca series of shifting expla-\nnations.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  Petitioner accordingly received \nonly 4.25 hours of instruction each school day during \nmost of her years in the District, while other students \ngenerally received 6.5 hours.  Id. at 8a-9a, 50a-51a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Min-\nnesota Department of Education, alleging that the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s refusal to provide after-hours instruction denied \npetitioner a FAPE in violation of the IDEA.  Pet. App. \n51a.  After a hearing, the state agency concluded that \nthe District had denied petitioner a FAPE.  Ibid.  The \nagency ordered the District to provide petitioner with \n495 hours of compensatory education and at-home in-\nstruction from 4:30 to 6 p.m. each school day.  Ibid.   \nThe District sought judicial review, and a federal dis-\ntrict court affirmed both (1) the state agency\u2019s finding \nthat the District had denied petitioner a FAPE in viola-\ntion of the IDEA, and (2) the remedy the agency had \nimposed.  Osseo Area Sch. v. A.J.T., No. 21-cv-1453, \n2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d, \n96 F.4th 1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  The court of appeals af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s judgment.  Pet. App. 49a-57a. \n2. a. Petitioner separately sued respondents (the \nOsseo Area School District and the Osseo School Board) \nin federal district court, alleging that respondents had \ndiscriminated against her on account of her disability, \nin violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Pet. App. 7a.  Petitioner sought \na permanent injunction and compensatory damages.  \nAm. Compl. 25, 28-29. \nThe district court granted respondents\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 6a-43a.  The court found \n\n9 \n \nthat, when \u201calleged ADA and [Section] 504 violations \nare based on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in bad \nfaith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citation \nomitted); see id. at 24a-25a.  The court applied that \nstandard and concluded that respondents \u201cdid not act \nwith bad faith or gross misjudgment when making edu-\ncational decisions regarding\u201d petitioner.  Id. at 7a; see \nid. at 25a-36a.   \nb. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-5a.  \nThe court explained that, under Eighth Circuit prece-\ndent, when \u201calleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \n\u2018based on educational services for disabled children,\u2019  \n* * *  a plaintiff must prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d in order \nto establish the defendants\u2019 \u201cliability.\u201d  Id. at 3a (cita-\ntions omitted).  The court concluded that, although pe-\ntitioner \u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether [respondents were] negligent or even deliber-\nately indifferent,\u201d she had failed to provide sufficient \nevidence of \u201c\u200a\u2018bad faith or gross misjudgment\u2019\u200a\u201d to with-\nstand respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 3a-5a.  The court made clear \nthat it viewed the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard as significantly more demanding than the in-\ntent standard that applies to non-school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims.  See id. at 5a n.2 (noting that  \nthe court \u201crequire[s] much less in other disability- \ndiscrimination contexts\u201d). \nAlthough the court of appeals applied the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as a matter of circuit \nprecedent, the court questioned the legal basis for that \nstandard.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  The court explained that \nthe standard had originated in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n\n10 \n \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983), in which the court had \u201cspeculated that Con-\ngress intended\u201d the IDEA \u201cto limit Section 504\u2019s pro-\ntections, and without any anchor in statutory text,  * * *  \nadded a judicial gloss on Section 504 to achieve that end.\u201d  \nPet. App. 5a n.2.  The court further noted that, although \nCongress had later \u201crejected Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d by \nenacting Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment rule\u201d had continued to \u201cspread like wild-\nfire.\u201d  Ibid.  The court accordingly viewed the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard as offering \u201ca lesson in \n\u2018why we do not  . . .  add provisions to  . . .  federal stat-\nutes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (brackets and citation omitted).   \nc. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc, \nwith Judges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes noting that they \nwould have granted the petition for en banc rehearing.  \nPet. App. 44a-45a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA.  1.  To establish a violation of Title II of the ADA \nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff need \nonly prove that she was an individual with a disability \nwho was discriminated against by reason of her disabil-\nity.  Those showings can be made without proof that the \ndefendant intended to discriminate.  Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 are framed in the passive voice and do not sug-\ngest that an actor\u2019s bad intent is an element of a statu-\ntory violation.  Accordingly, a plaintiff may obtain in-\njunctive relief under Title II or Section 504 without \nproving intent to discriminate, as long as the other re-\nquirements for injunctive relief are satisfied.   \n2.  To obtain compensatory damages under Title II \nor Section 504, however, a plaintiff must prove inten-\ntional discrimination; to do so, she must at a minimum \nprove deliberate indifference.  Both the intent require-\n\n11 \n \nment and the deliberate-indifference standard are drawn \nfrom this Court\u2019s decisions interpreting similar stat-\nutes.  And the deliberate-indifference standard\u2014which \nrequires proof that a covered entity failed to act despite \nits actual knowledge that a federally protected right \nwas substantially likely to be violated\u2014ensures that \nschools will not incur damages liability on account of \nmistakes, negligence, or bureaucratic inaction.  That \nstandard also appropriately balances the relevant con-\nsiderations that this Court has identified:  It ensures \nthat regulated entities will have notice before they are \nheld liable for damages, and it gives them the necessary \nflexibility to implement their programs, while also sup-\nporting the ADA\u2019s and the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s goals of \nassuring that people with disabilities have equal oppor-\ntunities and are fully integrated into society.   \nB.  1.  Some courts have applied a heightened intent \nstandard\u2014\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d\u2014to Title \nII and Section 504 claims that arise in the context of el-\nementary or secondary education.  The Court should re-\nject that approach.  Because the texts of Title II and \nSection 504 do not distinguish between school and non-\nschool settings, there is no sound basis for that idiosyn-\ncratic heightened standard. \n2.  The statutory context reinforces that conclusion.  \nFor these purposes, the only potentially salient distinc-\ntion between school and non-school settings is that the \nschool setting is also subject to the IDEA.  But impos-\ning a heightened intent requirement on that basis would \ncontravene Congress\u2019s directive that the IDEA should \nnot be read to \u201crestrict or limit  * * *  the remedies \navailable under\u201d the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  Indeed, Congress enacted Section \n1415(l) in order to overturn a decision of this Court that \n\n12 \n \nhad read the IDEA to preclude application of Section \n504 in the context of elementary and secondary educa-\ntion.  A heightened intent requirement would also dis-\nserve the purposes of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct, which broadly seek to end disability discrimination \nthroughout society, including in elementary and sec-\nondary schools. \n3.  Like other courts that have adopted the \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d standard, the Eighth Circuit be-\nlow has identified no sound basis for that standard.  Ra-\nther, the standard originated in dictum that was wrong \nwhen it was first articulated and has been further dis-\ncredited by Congress\u2019s intervening enactment of Sec-\ntion 1415(l).  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise have no \nbasis in the statutory text or context, and the policy con-\ncerns that respondents invoke are overstated. \nARGUMENT \nA. Proof Of Discriminatory Intent Is Not Required To \nDemonstrate A Violation Of Title II Or Section 504, But \nSuch Proof Is Required To Recover Damages Under \nThose Provisions \nUnder Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Re-\nhabilitation Act, plaintiffs may bring suit seeking \u201cmoney \ndamages\u201d and \u201cinjunctive relief.\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon Com-\nmunity Sch., 580 U.S. 154, 160 (2017).  Well-established \nlegal standards govern those claims.  To demonstrate a \nviolation of Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff need not \nprove that the defendant intended to engage in disabil-\nity discrimination.  And a plaintiff need not make a show-\ning of discriminatory intent in order to obtain injunctive \nor other equitable relief under those statutes.  But a \nplaintiff seeking compensatory damages must prove in-\ntentional discrimination; she may make that showing by \nproving deliberate indifference.  As discussed below in \n\n13 \n \nPart B, those standards also apply in the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education.   \n1. To establish a violation of Title II or Section 504, a \nplaintiff need not prove that the defendant intended \nto engage in disability discrimination \nBy its plain terms, Section 504 protects a covered in-\ndividual from specified outcomes\u2014\u201cbe[ing] excluded\u201d \nfrom participation, \u201cbe[ing] denied\u201d benefits, or \u201cbe[ing] \nsubjected to\u201d discrimination\u2014when the adverse effect \noccurs \u201csolely by reason of,\u201d i.e., has a sufficient causal \nlink to, that individual\u2019s disability.  29 U.S.C. 794(a); cf. \nHemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 9 (2010).  \nSection 504 is written in the \u201cpassive voice,\u201d \u201cfocus[ing] \non an event that occurs without respect to a specific ac-\ntor, and therefore without respect to any actor\u2019s intent \nor culpability.\u201d  Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. 568, 572 \n(2009).  \u201cCongress\u2019 use of the passive voice\u201d \u201cindicates \nthat [Section 504] does not require proof of intent.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThis Court has also observed that, when Congress \nenacted the Rehabilitation Act in 1973, \u201c[d]iscrimina-\ntion against the handicapped was perceived by Con-\ngress to be most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014of \nbenign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985).  For that reason, \u201cmuch of the conduct that Con-\ngress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation Act \nwould be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act \nconstrued to proscribe only conduct fueled by a discrim-\ninatory intent.\u201d  Id. at 296-297.  The same is true of the \nkey provision of Title II of the ADA, which was modeled \non Section 504 and is also in the passive voice.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 12132 (\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from par-\n\n14 \n \nticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjec-\nted to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d).  A height-\nened intent standard for establishing liability would \nalso undermine the congressional objectives articulated \nin the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act:  maximizing the \n\u201cinclusion and integration\u201d into \u201csociety\u201d of individuals \nwith disabilities, 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F), and \u201cassur[ing] \nequality of opportunity, full participation, independent \nliving, and economic self-sufficiency\u201d for persons with \ndisabilities, 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7).  See pp. 25-26, infra \n(discussing the purposes of those statutes in more de-\ntail); see also S.H. v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d \n248, 264 (3d Cir. 2013). \nAs a general matter, the courts of appeals have \nagreed that a plaintiff need not prove intent to discrim-\ninate in order to establish a violation of Title II or Sec-\ntion 504.  See, e.g., Ruskai v. Pistole, 775 F.3d 61, 78 (1st \nCir. 2014); but see Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of \nTenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 235, 241 (6th Cir. 2019).  Thus, they \nhave described proof of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d (an in-\ntent showing, see pp. 15-18, infra) as \u201can additional hur-\ndle\u201d that under Title II and Section 504 applies only  \nto claims for \u201cdamages.\u201d  Silberman v. Miami Dade \nTransit, 927 F.3d 1123, 1134 (11th Cir. 2019).  The courts \nof appeals have also explained that \u201cequitable remedies \nfor violations of the ADA\u201d\u2014including \u201cinjunction[s] man-\ndating compliance with its provisions\u201d\u2014\u201care available \nregardless of a defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d  Midgett v. Tri-\nCounty Metro. Transp. Dist., 254 F.3d 846, 851 (9th Cir. \n2001); see Hall v. Higgins, 77 F.4th 1171, 1180-1181 (8th \nCir. 2023) (indicating that the need to show deliberate \nindifference applies only to damages claims); D.E. v. \nCentral Dauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 269 (3d Cir. \n\n15 \n \n2014) (similar); Mark H. v. Hamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090, \n1097 (9th Cir. 2010) (similar). \n2. To obtain compensatory damages for Title II and Sec-\ntion 504 violations, a plaintiff must prove intentional \ndiscrimination, which may be shown by proving de-\nliberate indifference  \nA private plaintiff seeking money damages for a vio-\nlation of Title II or Section 504 must prove that the de-\nfendant engaged in intentional discrimination.  A plain-\ntiff may prove that discriminatory intent by demon-\nstrating that the defendant acted with deliberate indif-\nference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s federally protected rights\u2014a \nstandard that is properly understood to require a show-\ning considerably higher than negligence. \na. To demonstrate an entitlement to compensatory \ndamages under Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff must \nprove that the covered entity intentionally discriminated \nagainst the plaintiff.  Petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 7) \nthat \u201cpeople with disabilities may not obtain damages \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act without proving \nintent.\u201d  And the courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that, \u201c[t]o recover monetary damages under Ti-\ntle II of the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff \nmust prove intentional discrimination on the part of the \ndefendant.\u201d  Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, \n1138 (9th Cir. 2001) (footnote omitted); see, e.g., S.H., \n729 F.3d at 260-262; Liese v. Indian River County \nHosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 344 (11th Cir. 2012); Meagley \nv. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011); \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009); Barber v. Colorado Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 562 \nF.3d 1222, 1228 (10th Cir. 2009). \nA discriminatory-intent requirement for damages \nclaims under Title II and Section 504 is consistent with \n\n16 \n \nthis Court\u2019s decisions interpreting Title IX of the Edu-\ncation Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 86 Stat. \n373-375.  Title IX\u2019s prohibition on discrimination is sim-\nilar to that in the Rehabilitation Act, although Title IX \naddresses sex discrimination in federally funded educa-\ntional programs and activities, while the Rehabilitation \nAct addresses disability discrimination in all programs \nand activities conducted by recipients of federal funds.  \nCompare 20 U.S.C. 1681(a), with 29 U.S.C. 794(a).  \u201cWhen \nCongress attaches conditions to the award of federal \nfunds under its spending power,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] \nclosely the propriety of private actions holding the re-\ncipient liable in monetary damages for noncompliance \nwith the condition.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. \nDist., 524 U.S. 274, 287 (1998).  The Court in Gebser con-\ncluded that, while equitable relief might be appropriate \nto undo the effects of unintentional Title IX violations \nand prevent such violations from recurring, only inten-\ntional violators are subject to damages liability.  See id. \nat 287-291; Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 74-75 (1992).  The same approach is appropriate \nunder Title II and Section 504.   \nb. To prove intent to discriminate, a Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 plaintiff needs to show that an entity acted with \nat least deliberate indifference to the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s feder-\nally protected rights.  That standard is grounded in this \nCourt\u2019s decisions in Gebser, supra, and Davis v. Monroe \nCounty Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), and in \nthe similarities between those statutes and Title IX.  \nAnd outside the educational context, courts of appeals \nhave generally concluded that a plaintiff can prove in-\ntentional discrimination by demonstrating deliberate \nindifference on the part of a covered entity.  See, e.g., \nS.H., 729 F.3d at 262-265; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344-351; \n\n17 \n \nMeagley, 639 F.3d at 389-390; Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 275; \nBarber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229; Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1138-\n1139.1 \nIn Gebser, the Court considered the circumstances in \nwhich an educational institution receiving federal funds \nmay be held liable for damages under Title IX for sexual \nharassment of a student by a teacher.  524 U.S. at 277.  \nThe Court concluded that damages could be recovered \nin such a case only when \u201can official who at a minimum \nhas authority to address the alleged discrimination and \nto institute corrective measures on the recipient\u2019s be-\nhalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recip-\nient\u2019s programs\u201d and responds with \u201cdeliberate indif-\nference to [the] discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 290.  In adopting \nthe deliberate-indifference standard, the Court ex-\nplained that Title IX \u201cattaches conditions to the award \nof federal funds,\u201d and that a federal funding recipient \ngenerally should have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that it will be liable for a \nmonetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 287 (citation omitted).  The \nCourt also noted that Title IX\u2019s express remedial scheme, \nwhich allows termination of federal funding by the gov-\nernment, is predicated on notice and an opportunity for \nthe recipient to rectify a violation.  Id. at 289.  The Court \naccordingly found that Congress did not intend to sub-\nject a recipient of federal funding to damages liability \n \n1 Proof of discriminatory intent does not require evidence of dis-\ncriminatory animus.  The courts of appeals have generally con-\ncluded that the deliberate-indifference standard \u201cdoes not require a \nshowing of personal ill will or animosity toward the disabled person; \nrather, \u2018intentional discrimination can be inferred from a defend-\nant\u2019s deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of \nits questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally \nprotected rights.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Barber, 562 F.3d at 1228-1229 (citation omitted); \nsee, e.g., S.H., 729 F.3d at 263; Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Loeffler, 582 \nF.3d at 275. \n\n18 \n \nin a private Title IX action when the recipient \u201cwas un-\naware of discrimination in its programs and is willing to \ninstitute prompt corrective measures.\u201d  Ibid. \nIn Davis, the Court extended Gebser to claims alleg-\ning \u201cstudent-on-student harassment,\u201d holding that dam-\nages can be awarded against a school board under Title \nIX \u201cwhere the funding recipient acts with deliberate in-\ndifference to known acts of harassment in its programs \nor activities.\u201d  Davis, 526 U.S. at 633.  In reaching that \nconclusion, the Court emphasized that deliberate indif-\nference is a \u201chigh standard\u201d that allows \u201c[s]chool admin-\nistrators [to] continue to enjoy the flexibility they re-\nquire\u201d because a plaintiff must prove \u201cactual knowledge\u201d \nof discrimination and \u201c\u200a\u2018an official decision by the recip-\nient not to remedy the violation.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 642-643, 648 \n(citation omitted). \nGebser\u2019s rationales for adopting the deliberate- \nindifference standard apply with full force to damages \nclaims under Section 504.  See Liese, 701 F.3d at 348 \n(\u201cBecause of the similarities between Title IX and the \n[Rehabilitation Act], Gebser\u2019s  * * *  reasoning applies \nwith similar force to the [Rehabilitation Act] and yields \nthe same result.\u201d).  And while the ADA is not a Spend-\ning Clause statute, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1, Title \nII\u2019s incorporation of Section 504\u2019s remedies suggests \nthat the same rationales apply to Title II claims.2   \n \n2 Entry of an injunction ordering a covered entity to comply with \nits legal obligations under Title II or Section 504 does not raise the \nsame concerns that motivated the Court to adopt the deliberate- \nindifference standard for the private damages claims at issue in \nGebser and Davis.  Unlike damages, equitable relief does not impli-\ncate the Court\u2019s \u201ccentral concern\u201d when interpreting Spending \nClause statutes:  \u201cthat \u2018the receiving entity of federal funds has no-\ntice that it will be liable for a monetary award.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 287 (brackets and citation omitted).  And unlike damages liability \n\n19 \n \nc. The deliberate-indifference intent requirement is \n\u201can exacting standard,\u201d J.S. v. Houston County Bd. of \nEduc., 877 F.3d 979, 987 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) \n(citation omitted), that ensures that entities cannot be \nheld liable for damages on account of mistakes, negli-\ngence, or bureaucratic inaction.  Similar to the analysis \nthis Court applied in Gebser and Davis, courts analyz-\ning Title II and Section 504 damages claims must ask \nwhether the evidence proves that the covered entity both \n\u201c(1) [had] knowledge that a federally protected right is \nsubstantially likely to be violated  * * *  and (2) fail[ed] \nto act despite that knowledge.\u201d  S.H., 729 F.3d at 265; \nsee Liese, 701 F.3d at 344; Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229.  Ap-\nplication of the deliberate-indifference standard to Title \nII and Section 504 damages claims accordingly ensures \nthat regulated entities will have \u201c\u200a\u2018notice that [they] will \nbe liable for a monetary award,\u2019\u200a\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287 \n(citation omitted), and provides them with the neces-\nsary \u201cflexibility\u201d to implement their programs without \nfear of unexpected damages liability, Davis, 526 U.S. at \n648.   \nThe knowledge requirement demands \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d of the substantial likelihood of discrimination, \nGebser, 524 U.S. at 290, and does not generally allow \nimposition of damages liability based on what the de-\nfendant \u201cshould have known,\u201d Davis, 526 U.S. at 642.  \nSee, e.g., J.S., 877 F.3d at 989 (applying an \u201cactual know-\nledge\u201d standard); Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (same).  And \nthe failure-to-act requirement requires proof of \u201ca  \n\u2018deliberate choice, rather than negligence or bureau-\ncratic inaction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276 (citation omit-\n \nfor past violations, a recipient of federal funds can avoid equitable \nrelief under the Rehabilitation Act by withdrawing from the federal \nfunding program.   \n\n20 \n \nted); see Liese, 701 F.3d at 344 (\u201c[D]eliberate indiffer-\nence plainly requires more than gross negligence.\u201d); \nJ.V. v. Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 813 F.3d 1289, 1298 (10th \nCir. 2016) (\u201cThe failure to act must be \u2018more than negli-\ngent\u2019 and involve \u2018an element of deliberateness.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Barber, 562 F.3d at 1229 (similar);  \n1 Americans with Disabilities: Practice and Compli-\nance Manual \u00a7\u00a7 1:261, 2:222 (2d ed. 2024).  \u201c[D]eliber-\nate indifference does not occur where a duty to act may \nsimply have been overlooked, or a complaint may rea-\nsonably have been deemed to result from events taking \ntheir normal course\u201d; in other words, \u201cbureaucratic \nslippage that constitutes negligence\u201d is not deliberate \nindifference.  Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1139. \nB. Title II And Section 504 Claims Are Subject To The \nSame Intent Standards Inside And Outside The Educa-\ntional Context \nIn the decision below, the Eighth Circuit recognized \nthat, outside the context of elementary and secondary \neducation, defendants can be held liable under Title II \nand Section 504 based on their failure to make reasona-\nble accommodations, even absent proof of intentional \ndiscrimination.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  The question \npresented, as set forth in the petition for a writ of certi-\norari, asks whether \u201ca uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u2019 standard\u201d applies to disability- \ndiscrimination claims when plaintiffs \u201cseek[] relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education.\u201d  Pet. i (em-\nphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 brief in opposition does \nnot dispute that, outside of school settings, Section 504 \n\n21 \n \nof the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA do not \nrequire proof of intentional discrimination.3   \nThe Eighth Circuit nevertheless held that, \u201cwhen the \nalleged ADA and Section 504 violations are \u2018based on \neducational services for disabled children,\u2019 a school dis-\ntrict\u2019s simple failure to provide a reasonable accommo-\ndation is not enough to trigger liability.\u201d  Pet. App. 3a \n(citation omitted).  The court applied circuit precedents \nholding that, in the school setting, a plaintiff must prove \n\u201ceither bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d as well.  Ibid. \n(citation omitted); see id. at 5a n.2 (explaining that \nEighth Circuit precedents impose \u201ca high bar for claims \nbased on educational services\u201d even though the court \n\u201crequire[s] much less in other disability-discrimination \ncontexts\u201d).  Nothing in the text or purposes of Title II \nor Section 504 supports that approach.   \n1. The texts of Title II and Section 504 indicate that the \nsame intent standards apply inside and outside the \neducational context \nThe substantive terms of Title II and Section 504\u2014\nwhich include those provisions\u2019 primary bans on disabil-\nity discrimination\u2014do not apply differently in school \nsettings than they do elsewhere.  Title II provides that \n\u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or ac-\ntivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimina-\n \n3 Indeed, respondents state that this Court in Choate, supra, \n\u201cheld that conduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u2018fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30 (quoting Choate, \n469 U.S. at 297).  Respondents argue that \u201c[t]he \u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019 standard takes this instruction [from Choate] into ac-\ncount by proscribing intentional conduct, bad faith, in addition to \nunintentional yet harmful conduct, gross misjudgment.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n22 \n \ntion by any such entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12132.  Section 504 \nprovides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability  * * *  shall, solely by reason of her or his dis-\nability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany\u201d covered program.  29 U.S.C. 794(a).  Both statu-\ntory provisions apply to any \u201cqualified individual,\u201d ibid.; \n42 U.S.C. 12132, and neither provision contains any lan-\nguage that distinguishes between educational and non-\neducational contexts (or between elementary and sec-\nondary schools, on the one hand, and colleges on the \nother, see Pet. Br. 43-44).   \nThe same is true of the two Acts\u2019 remedial provisions.  \nUnder the Rehabilitation Act, \u201c[t]he remedies, proce-\ndures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964,\u201d Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 252 (42 U.S.C. \n2000d et seq.), \u201cshall be available to any person ag-\ngrieved by any act or failure to act by\u201d a federal funding \nrecipient.  29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2).  And \u201c[t]he remedies, \nprocedures, and rights set forth\u201d in the Rehabilitation \nAct are available \u201cto any person alleging discrimina-\ntion\u201d under Title II.  42 U.S.C. 12133.  Accordingly, the \nremedies under each Act are available to \u201cany person\u201d \n\u2014regardless of the setting in which she claims to have \nsuffered disability-based discrimination.  Ibid.; 29 U.S.C. \n794a(a)(2).   \nReading those provisions to require one level of in-\ntent for claims brought in the context of elementary and \nsecondary education, and a different level of intent for \nclaims brought outside that context, would run afoul of \nbasic statutory-interpretation principles.  When a stat-\nutory phrase \u201c\u200a\u2018applies without differentiation\u2019\u200a\u201d to \u201ctwo \ncategories,\u201d courts ordinarily give that phrase the same \nmeaning as applied to both categories.  Pasquantino v. \n\n23 \n \nUnited States, 544 U.S. 349, 358 (2005) (citation omit-\nted).  Because the Eighth Circuit\u2019s heightened intent \nrequirement gives the \u201csame words a different meaning \nfor each category,\u201d that reading would impermissibly \n\u201cinvent a statute rather than interpret one.\u201d  Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 378 (2005); see United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (plurality opinion) (not-\ning that the Court has \u201cnever engaged in [the] interpre-\ntive contortion\u201d of \u201cgiving the same word, in the same \nstatutory provision, different meanings in different \nfactual contexts\u201d). \n2. The statutory context supports reading Title II and \nSection 504 to impose the same intent standards in-\nside and outside the educational context  \nFor purposes of the question presented here, the \nonly salient difference between school-based Title II \nand Section 504 claims, and other claims brought under \nthose statutes, is that the school-based claims poten-\ntially implicate the IDEA.  That difference, however, \nprovides no sound basis for the Eighth Circuit\u2019s height-\nened intent standard.  To the contrary, the larger stat-\nutory context\u2014which includes both the IDEA and the \ncongressionally articulated purposes of Title II and \nSection 504\u2014confirms that Title II and Section 504 \nclaims based on a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s treatment by an elementary \nor secondary school are governed by the same intent \nstandards that apply to all other Title II and Section 504 \nclaims. \na. The IDEA confirms that Title II and Section 504 \ndo not mean different things in different contexts.  Con-\ntra Br. in Opp. 27-30.  The IDEA provides that, with the \nexception of an exhaustion requirement that is not rel-\nevant here, \u201c[n]othing in\u201d the IDEA \u201cshall be construed \nto restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies \n\n24 \n \navailable under  * * *  the Americans with Disabilities \nAct\u201d or \u201cthe Rehabilitation Act.\u201d  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).   \nCongress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA in order \nto overturn this Court\u2019s holding in Smith v. Robinson, \n468 U.S. 992 (1984).  In Smith, the Court held that the \nIDEA in its then-current form \u201cwas \u2018the exclusive ave-\nnue\u2019 through which a child with a disability (or his par-\nents) could challenge the adequacy of his education.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 160 (quoting Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009).  \nThe Court accordingly held that the plaintiffs could not \ninvoke the Equal Protection Clause and Section 504  \nas alternative means of vindicating children\u2019s IDEA- \nprotected educational rights.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009-\n1013, 1016-1021. \nIn 1986, Congress responded by enacting the provi-\nsion that is \u201c[n]ow codified\u201d as Section 1415(l), which \n\u201coverturned Smith\u2019s preclusion of non-IDEA claims.\u201d  \nFry, 580 U.S. at 161.  Section 1415(l) \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirm[ed] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA or Rehabilita-\ntion Act \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less integral than the \nIDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of handicapped chil-\ndren.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 296, 99th Cong., 1st \nSess. 4 (1985)).  And Section 1415(l) focused on \u201cremedies \nand relief,\u201d Luna Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Sch., 598 U.S. 142, \n148 (2023); see id. at 147-150, making clear that \u201c[n]othing \nin\u201d the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or limit[s] the  * * *  remedies \navailable under\u201d Title II or Section 504, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  \nRequiring plaintiffs to meet a heightened intent re-\nquirement when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims \nin the context of elementary and secondary education \nwould \u201crestrict or limit\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cremedies,\u201d ibid., in plain contravention of the text of \nSection 1415(l). \n\n25 \n \nb. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s school-specific \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d requirement is likewise incon-\nsistent with the congressional purposes identified in the \nrelevant statutory texts.  The Rehabilitation Act seeks \nto maximize the \u201cinclusion and integration into society\u201d \nof individuals with disabilities, including by integrating \nindividuals into the \u201ceducational mainstream of Ameri-\ncan society.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F) and (b)(1); see 29 \nU.S.C. 701(a)(5), (a)(6)(B), and (c)(3).  As already noted, \nwhen it enacted the Rehabilitation Act, Congress \u201cper-\nceived\u201d that \u201c[d]iscrimination against the handicapped \nwas  * * *  most often the product, not of invidious ani-\nmus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference\u2014\nof benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295.  And sub-\nsequent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act \u201creflec-\nted Congress\u2019 concern with protecting the handicapped \nagainst discrimination stemming not only from simple \nprejudice, but also from \u2018archaic attitudes and laws\u2019 and \nfrom \u2018the fact that the American people [we]re simply \nunfamiliar with and insensitive to the difficulties con-\nfronting individuals with handicaps.\u2019\u200a\u201d  School Bd. of \nNassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 279 (1987) (quo-\nting S. Rep. No. 1297, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1974)) \n(brackets omitted).   \nCongress enacted Title II of the ADA to extend the \nanti-discrimination principle in the Rehabilitation Act \nbeyond executive-branch agencies and recipients of fed-\neral funds.  See Berardelli v. Allied Servs. Inst. of Re-\nhab. Med., 900 F.3d 104, 115 (3d Cir. 2018); see also Fry, \n580 U.S. at 159-160, 170-171 (noting that Title II and \nSection 504 have substantially similar purposes and cov-\nerage).  The ADA accordingly seeks to further the \u201cgoals\u201d \nof \u201cassur[ing] equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency,\u201d  \n\n26 \n \n42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(7), including in the educational con-\ntext, see 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) and (6).   \nRequiring students to make a showing of heightened \nintent when bringing Title II and Section 504 claims in \nthe school context would undermine the goals of max-\nimizing students\u2019 \u201cinclusion and integration\u201d in educa-\ntional institutions and of \u201cassur[ing] equality of\u200a\u201d educa-\ntional \u201copportunity.\u201d  29 U.S.C. 701(a)(3)(F); 42 U.S.C. \n12101(a)(7).  Differential treatment of such claims \nwould be particularly inappropriate because both stat-\nutes expressly acknowledge the importance of curbing \ndisability-based discrimination in \u201ceducation\u201d alongside \nnumerous other situations in which such discrimination \nmay occur.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3) (congres-\nsional finding that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals \nwith disabilities persists in such critical areas as em-\nployment, housing, public accommodations, education, \ntransportation, communication, recreation, institution-\nalization, health services, voting, and access to public \nservices\u201d); 29 U.S.C. 701(a)(5) (\u201c[I]ndividuals with disa-\nbilities continually encounter various forms of discrimi-\nnation in such critical areas as employment, housing, \npublic accommodations, education, transportation, com-\nmunication, recreation, institutionalization, health ser-\nvices, voting, and public services.\u201d).  Applying different \nintent standards inside and outside the context of ele-\nmentary and secondary education would undermine \nCongress\u2019s choice to bar even discrimination that arises \nout of \u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d \u201cindifference,\u201d and \u201cbenign ne-\nglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295; cf. Liese, 701 F.3d at 348.  \n\n27 \n \n3. The Eighth Circuit and respondents have identified \nno sound basis for applying a heightened intent  \nrequirement to disability-discrimination claims in \nthe context of elementary and secondary education \nThe Eighth Circuit identified no sound basis for ap-\nplying a heightened \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard to ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought \nin the school context.  Respondents\u2019 arguments likewise \nlack merit.   \na. The courts of appeals that apply a \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard to Title II and Section \n504 claims in the educational context have identified no \nsound basis for that heightened standard.  As the court \nof appeals recognized here, Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2, the \nheightened standard originated in its decision in Mo-\nnahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. \ndenied, 460 U.S. 1012 (1983).  In Monahan, the court \naffirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 and \nIDEA claims, which alleged infirmities in the State\u2019s \nprocess for reviewing educational placement decisions.  \nId. at 1167-1168.  The court found that the IDEA claim \nwas moot because it was premised on a challenge to a \nstate law that had been amended since the plaintiffs \nfiled their complaints.  Id. at 1168.  The court further \nfound that, because the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaims of violation of \n[Section] 504 seem to rest on the same procedural theo-\nries that plaintiffs have unsuccessfully urged under [the \nIDEA],\u201d dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 Section 504 claims \nwas appropriate as well.  Id. at 1170. \nAfter reaching that conclusion, the Eighth Circuit \n\u201cadd[ed] a few words for the guidance of the District \nCourt and the parties\u201d in the event the plaintiffs \u201cre-\nfil[ed]  * * *  a new complaint.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at \n1170.  The court stated that a plaintiff must prove \u201cei-\n\n28 \n \nther bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to \u201cshow[]\u201d a Sec-\ntion 504 \u201cviolation  * * *  at least in the context of edu-\ncation of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  The court \nviewed such a standard as necessary because \u201c[t]he Re-\nhabilitation Act and [the IDEA] are entirely different \nstatutes\u201d; because the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard would \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \nintended by Congress\u201d; and because the intent require-\nment would \u201cproper[ly] balance  * * *  the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state edu-\ncation officials, and the competence of courts to make \njudgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id. at 1170-1171. \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d stand-\nard had no basis in the then-current text of the Rehabil-\nitation Act.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  And Congress\u2019s sub-\nsequent addition of Section 1415(l) to the IDEA con-\nfirms the impropriety of imposing uniquely stringent \nrequirements for school-based disability-discrimination \nclaims.  Two years after the Eighth Circuit decided Mo-\nnahan, this Court similarly read Section 504 and the \nIDEA to cover separate ground, holding that the IDEA \nwas \u201cthe exclusive avenue\u201d for challenging the ade-\nquacy of a child\u2019s education.  Smith, 468 U.S. at 1009; \nsee p. 24, supra.  Congress promptly rejected that ap-\nproach, however, by enacting Section 1415(l), which \nprovides that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be con-\nstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and \nremedies available under\u201d Title II and Section 504.  20 \nU.S.C. 1415(l); see pp. 6-7, 23-24, supra.  By imposing a \nheightened intent requirement only on Section 504 \nclaims that arise \u201cin the context of education of\u200a\u201d chil-\ndren with disabilities, 687 F.2d at 1171, Monahan read \nthe IDEA to \u201climit the rights\u201d and \u201cremedies available \nunder\u201d the Rehabilitation Act, 20 U.S.C. 1415(l)\u2014an in-\n\n29 \n \nterpretation that is now expressly foreclosed by Section \n1415(l). \nb. Respondents\u2019 defense of Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d standard fares no better. \ni. Respondents have observed (Br. in Opp. 26) that \npetitioner\u2019s private rights of action under Title II and \nSection 504 stem from the judicially implied cause of ac-\ntion under Title VI.  Respondents contend that this Court \ntherefore has a \u201cmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible \nremedial scheme that best comports with the statute.\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  Re-\nspondents further claim (Br. in Opp. 27) that the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s heightened standard \u201cis an appropriate exer-\ncise of that discretion\u201d because Title II and Section 504 \nclaims in the educational context may overlap with \nIDEA claims and touch on educational policy.  Given the \nrelief available under the IDEA, plaintiffs who allege \ndisability-based discrimination in elementary and sec-\nondary schools may less often have a practical need to \ninvoke the remedies that Title II and Section 504 pro-\nvide.  There is no sound basis, however, for applying a \ndifferent legal standard to school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims than to other claims brought under \nthose statutes. \nIn Gebser, this Court recognized that, \u201c[b]ecause the \nprivate right of action under Title IX is judicially im-\nplied,\u201d no statutory language specifies the standard \nthat governs damages claims under that law.  524 U.S. \nat 284.  The Court explained that, when \u201cshap[ing] a \nsensible remedial scheme that best comports with the \nstatute,\u201d the Court \u201cexamine[s] the relevant statute to \nensure that [the Court does] not fashion the scope of an \nimplied right in a manner at odds with the statutory \nstructure and purpose.\u201d  Ibid.  Applying that analysis \n\n30 \n \nhere, the statutory text, structure, context, and purpose \nall point in the same direction:  Congress intended Title \nII and Section 504 to apply fully in the educational con-\ntext, even if claims under those statutes sometimes \noverlap with IDEA claims.  See pp. 21-26, supra.  In-\ndeed, Congress added Section 1415(l) to the IDEA to \nrepudiate the inference that this overlap in coverage \nshould affect Title II\u2019s and Section 504\u2019s application to \nschool-based claims.  See pp. 23-24, supra. \nThere is consequently no basis in the \u201cstatutory \nstructure\u201d or \u201cpurpose,\u201d Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284, for the \neducation-specific intent requirement that the Monahan \ncourt adopted.  And it would \u201cfrustrate the purposes\u201d of \nTitle II and Section 504, id. at 285\u2014which seek to elimi-\nnate disability-based discrimination equally within and \noutside the educational context, see pp. 25-26, supra\u2014\nto apply a heightened intent standard solely to school-\nbased claims.   \nii. Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that the \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is more con-\nsistent with the Court\u2019s statement in Choate that \u201cmuch \nof the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing \nthe Rehabilitation Act would be difficult if not impossi-\nble to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only \nconduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  469 U.S. at \n296-297.  In respondents\u2019 view, \u201cthe \u2018deliberate indiffer-\nence\u2019 standard\u201d is less consistent with Choate because \nit \u201cstill requires discriminatory intent.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 30-\n31; see p. 21 n.3, supra.  But Choate, which involved a \nclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief, discussed \nonly the requirements for proving disability discrimina-\ntion, see 469 U.S. at 289, 292-299; it did not discuss the \nrequirements for obtaining damages, which all agree in-\nclude a showing of intent, see Br. in Opp. 26. \n\n31 \n \nIn briefly defending the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudg-\nment\u201d standard, respondents appear to contend (Br. in \nOpp. 31-32) that the standard applies to all Title II and \nSection 504 claims, not simply to those that involve ele-\nmentary and secondary education.  But no court of ap-\npeals has adopted that view, and the decision below \nmade clear that the court viewed the standard as a height-\nened intent requirement that applies only to school-\nbased claims.  See Pet. App. 3a, 5a n.2.  And respond-\nents\u2019 argument is not directly responsive to the question \npresented in the petition for a writ of certiorari, which \nasks this Court to consider whether \u201cchildren with dis-\nabilities\u201d must \u201csatisfy a uniquely stringent \u2018bad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u2019 standard when seeking relief for \ndiscrimination relating to their education\u201d under Title \nII or Section 504.  Pet. i (emphasis added); see p. 20, \nsupra. \niii.  Respondents observe (Br. in Opp. 31) that Con-\ngress enacted Section 1415(l) to overturn this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Smith, and that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision \nin Monahan is \u201cdistinct\u201d from Smith.  To be sure, the \nEighth Circuit\u2019s decision in Monahan was less restric-\ntive than this Court\u2019s decision in Smith, because the \nEighth Circuit announced a heightened intent standard \nfor school-based Title II and Section 504 claims but did \nnot hold that such claims are entirely foreclosed.  But \nwhile Smith was the immediate impetus for Congress\u2019s \nenactment of Section 1415(l), Monahan\u2019s reasoning and \nits \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard are sim-\nilarly inconsistent with Section 1415(l)\u2019s plain text.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nadopted in Monahan reflected the Eighth Circuit\u2019s at-\ntempt \u201cto harmonize the Rehabilitation Act and the \n[IDEA] to the fullest extent possible.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  \n\n32 \n \nBut Section 1415(l) now expressly provides that \n\u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder\u201d Title II or Section 504.  20 U.S.C. 1415(l).  That \nlanguage \u201c\u200a\u2018reaffirms the viability\u2019 of federal statutes \nlike the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \u2018as separate vehi-\ncles,\u2019 no less integral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the \nrights of handicapped children.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 \n(brackets and citation omitted).  Congress thus disap-\nproved of efforts to invoke the IDEA\u2019s remedial scheme \nas a justification for narrowing the coverage of Title II \nor Section 504.  Respondents are correct that \u201cSection \n1415(l) does not  * * *  opine on the standard governing\u201d \nclaims under those statutes.  Br. in Opp. 31.  But Section \n1415(l) clearly indicates that the same intent standards \n\u2014both for liability and for damages\u2014should govern \nschool-based and non-school-based Title II and Section \n504 claims.   \niv.  Respondents assert (Br. in Opp. 28) that applying \nthe deliberate-indifference standard \u201cwould open the \ndoor for plaintiffs to end-run the statutorily prescribed \nIEP process.\u201d  But regardless of the applicable intent \nstandard, a plaintiff who wishes to bring Title II or Sec-\ntion 504 claims must first comply with Section 1415(l)\u2019s \nadministrative-exhaustion requirement whenever that \nrequirement applies.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (explain-\ning that \u201cthe second half of [Section] 1415(l)  * * *  im-\nposes a limit  * * *  in the form of an exhaustion provi-\nsion\u201d on Section 1415(l)\u2019s general rule that Title II and \nSection 504 claims are unaffected by the IDEA); id. at \n165 (summarizing the analysis used to determine \nwhether Section 1415(l)\u2019s exhaustion requirement ap-\nplies to a particular claim).  Indeed, Section 1415(l)\u2019s ex-\nplicit directive that ADA and Rehabilitation Act plain-\n\n33 \n \ntiffs must satisfy the IDEA\u2019s exhaustion requirement \nprovides further evidence that school-based Title II and \nSection 504 claims are not subject to any other education-\nspecific restrictions.   \nRespondents also contend that a heightened intent \nrequirement is necessary to avoid \u201cinhibit[ing] the abil-\nity of schools and parents to \u2018work cooperatively to find \nthe best education placement and services for the \nchild.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Op. 28 (brackets and citation omitted).  \nBut as explained above, see pp. 19-20, supra, schools \ncannot be held liable for damages when they merely \nmake mistakes, act negligently, or engage in bureau-\ncratic inaction that delays the delivery of services.  The \ndeliberate-indifference standard correctly respects the \nbalance Congress struck in Title II and Section 504:  It \npermits damages claims against covered entities that \nengage in disability discrimination, but only where they \nhave \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of a substantial likelihood \u201cof \ndiscrimination in the recipient\u2019s programs\u201d and yet re-\nspond with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. \nat 290.  In any event, respondents\u2019 policy arguments \ncannot override the plain text of the provisions that \nCongress enacted, which provide no basis for imposing \ndifferent intent requirements for school-based and non-\nschool-based Title II and Section 504 claims.  See 14 \nPenn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 270 (2009) (\u201cWe \ncannot rely on [a] judicial policy concern as a source of \nauthority for introducing a qualification into the [stat-\nute] that is not found in its text.\u201d). \n\n34 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated, and the case should be remanded for further pro-\nceedings.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nTHOMAS WHEELER \nActing General Counsel \nJOSHUA S.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petition for certiorari provides the first direct, comprehensive view of the school district's legal and factual arguments. While this document was filed before the Court agreed to hear the case, it lays the foundational blueprint for the Respondent's merits-stage defense. My beliefs are significantly updated, particularly regarding the nature and strength of the defense.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable and Contextualized):** This belief remains stable. The BIO confirms the Respondent's position was that no \"meaningful\" circuit split existed, an argument the Supreme Court necessarily rejected by granting certiorari. The BIO's arguments, however, will now be repurposed on the merits to argue that while the verbal formulations of the liability standard differ between circuits, they are functionally equivalent in practice, or that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is the most appropriate one for the unique educational context.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's Merits Argument is a Multi-Pronged Textualist and Structural Assault (Belief Stable):** My understanding of the Petitioner/SG's two-tiered framework (*Perez* model for liability, *Davis* standard for damages) remains unchanged. The BIO provides the direct target for this assault.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Architecture is Now Fully Illuminated (Belief Transformed from Inference to Evidence):** My previous belief about the Respondent's defense was an educated inference. The BIO replaces that inference with concrete evidence, confirming the core pillars and adding significant detail and strategic framing.\n    *   **Confirmation of Core Arguments:** As anticipated, the defense is built on deference to educator expertise (*Endrew F.*), the foundational precedent of *Monahan v. Nebraska*, and the principle from *Gebser* that courts can craft appropriate remedial schemes for implied rights of action.\n    *   **New Strategic Framing: \"Conceptual Peculiarity\":** The Respondent frames the overlap between the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act as a \"conceptual peculiarity\" unique to K-12 education. This framing is designed to justify a special, judicially-crafted liability standard that doesn't apply in other ADA/Rehab Act contexts (e.g., employment, public access). It argues that a simple application of a general discrimination standard would disrupt the specific and comprehensive scheme Congress created in the IDEA.\n    *   **New Factual Argument: \"Poor Vehicle\":** The Respondent argues this case is a \"poor vehicle\" because the school district *did* make accommodations (noon start, extended instruction time) and the student has *already received* relief (injunctive relief and compensation) through a separate IDEA proceeding. This argument will be used on the merits to portray the district's actions as reasonable disagreements over educational policy, not discrimination, and to suggest that the Petitioner is seeking a duplicative \"second bite at the apple\" for monetary damages.\n    *   **New and Powerful Signal: Elite Counsel:** The BIO reveals the Respondent is represented by Lisa Blatt of Williams & Connolly. Blatt is one of the most prominent and successful advocates before the Supreme Court. Her involvement is a major signal that the Respondent's arguments will be presented with maximum force and sophistication, tailored to the current Court's jurisprudence. This significantly balances the scales against the formidable weight of the Solicitor General's support for the Petitioner.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Sharpened Clash of Interpretive Models (Belief Sharpened and Deepened):** The BIO brings the fundamental jurisprudential clash into sharp relief.\n    *   **The Petitioner/SG Framework (Textualist/Precedential):** The ADA and Rehab Act do not contain the words \"bad faith or gross misjudgment.\" Therefore, courts cannot add them. For damages under Spending Clause statutes, the established standard is \"deliberate indifference\" (*Davis v. Monroe County*).\n    *   **The Respondent Framework (Contextualist/Structural/Pragmatic):** The unique context of special education requires a different approach. Applying a general \"deliberate indifference\" standard would undermine the expert-driven, collaborative process of the IDEA, turning every dispute over an Individualized Education Program (IEP) into a federal discrimination lawsuit. The \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard from *Monahan* properly balances the anti-discrimination statutes with the need for deference to educational professionals, as endorsed by *Endrew F*. This is a classic federalism and judicial restraint argument.\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention is Counter-Balanced (Belief Re-Calibrated):** The SG's brief remains a powerful signal favoring the Petitioner. However, the combination of the Respondent's sophisticated structural arguments and the involvement of top-tier Supreme Court counsel acts as a significant counterweight. This is no longer an asymmetrical fight; it is a battle between two of the most powerful legal forces that can appear before the Court: the U.S. Government and an elite private advocate.\n\n6.  **Prediction Confidence is Reduced and Nuanced (Meta-Belief Updated):** My previous confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome has decreased. The scales, once tipped toward the Petitioner by the SG's brief, are now much more balanced. The Respondent has a compelling defensive narrative: adopting the Petitioner's standard would lead to a flood of litigation, undermine the IDEA's expert-driven administrative scheme, and have federal judges second-guessing the professional judgment of educators. The \"poor vehicle\" facts of the case give the Court an off-ramp to issue a narrow, fact-bound decision or even affirm on the grounds that the school's conduct wouldn't meet the \"deliberate indifference\" standard anyway. My prediction is now highly contingent on which interpretive model\u2014the clean textualism of the Petitioner/SG or the pragmatic, context-driven structuralism of the Respondent\u2014proves more persuasive to a majority of the justices.",

The design beliefs are less explicitly articulated but imply adaptive strategic reasoning about the SG's intervention and potential Court reception, meriting a moderately high design complexity score. The beliefs are internally consistent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and clear logical progression, supporting a high coherence rating.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F.

Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the full merits-stage amicus brief from the Solicitor General (SG) provides the definitive, authoritative articulation of the U.S. Government's legal position. This moves my understanding beyond the general signal of support to a granular analysis of the specific legal architecture the government will present to the Court. My beliefs are substantially sharpened and re-calibrated.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted; The Legal Conflict is of National Importance (Belief Stable):** This foundational belief remains unchanged. The SG's detailed brief underscores the government's view that resolving the circuit split over the liability standard is critical for the uniform enforcement of federal disability rights law.\n\n2.  **The SG's Authoritative Framework is Now Explicit (Belief Transformed from Inference to Concrete Evidence):** My prior belief in a two-tiered framework is now confirmed and detailed with the SG's specific legal reasoning. This is no longer an inference based on general principles but a direct observation of the argument's structure.\n    *   **Tier 1 (Liability/Violation): No Intent Required.** The SG argues that to establish a *violation* of Title II or Section 504, a plaintiff only needs to prove they were discriminated against by a covered entity. The text of the statutes (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 and 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)) prohibits discrimination broadly and contains no language requiring proof of intent, bad faith, or gross misjudgment.\n    *   **Tier 2 (Remedy/Damages): \"Deliberate Indifference\" Required.** To obtain *compensatory damages*, the SG asserts a plaintiff must prove intentional discrimination. Crucially, the SG defines this standard as \"deliberate indifference,\" citing the Court's precedents for implied rights of action under Spending Clause statutes like *Davis v. Monroe County* and *Gebser v. Lago Vista*. This standard requires a showing that an official with authority to act had actual knowledge of discrimination and failed to adequately respond. This framework provides a limiting principle, directly countering the Respondent's \"flood of litigation\" argument by ensuring that \"mere mistakes or negligence\" are not subject to damages.\n\n3.  **Respondent's Defensive Architecture Now Faces a Direct and Powerful Counter-Argument (Belief Sharpened):** The SG's brief is engineered to dismantle the Respondent's \"contextual peculiarity\" defense pillar by pillar.\n    *   **The Textual Counter-Attack:** The SG argues that the plain text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act applies universally to all public entities and federally funded programs, with no carve-out for K-12 education.\n    *   **The Structural \"Judo\" Move:** The SG's most powerful new argument co-opts the Respondent's focus on the statutory interplay with the IDEA. The SG points to the IDEA's own savings clause, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), as dispositive. This clause was enacted by Congress specifically to overrule *Smith v. Robinson* and explicitly states that the IDEA shall not be construed to \"restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under... the Americans with Disabilities Act... [or] the Rehabilitation Act.\" The SG will argue this is a direct congressional command *not* to create a special, heightened standard for education, but to apply the ADA and Rehab Act with their full, normal force.\n    *   **Neutralizing *Monahan*:** The SG's brief frames *Monahan v. Nebraska*\u2014the origin of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard\u2014as a historical artifact from a pre-\u00a7 1415(l) legal universe, rendering it obsolete.\n\n4.  **The Central Conflict: A Battle Over a Single Statutory Provision (Belief Hyper-Focused):** The clash of interpretive models has now crystallized around the meaning of 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).\n    *   **Respondent's View (Implicit):** The comprehensive nature of the IDEA implicitly requires courts to read the ADA/Rehab Act differently in the educational context to harmonize the statutes.\n    *   **SG's View (Explicit):** The plain text of \u00a7 1415(l) is Congress's explicit harmonization instruction, and it commands that the ADA/Rehab Act's normal standards and remedies be fully preserved, not diluted. The outcome of the case may hinge on which view of this provision the Court finds more persuasive.\n\n5.  **The SG's Intervention is a Formidable Offensive Force (Belief Re-Calibrated):** While the Respondent's representation by elite counsel (Lisa Blatt) remains a significant factor, the SG's brief is not merely a counter-balance; it is a powerful offensive weapon for the Petitioner. The elegance of the \u00a7 1415(l) argument provides the Court with a clear, text-based path to reverse the Eighth Circuit that is grounded in congressional action, not just abstract interpretive theory. This argument is likely to be very attractive to textualist and structuralist justices.\n\n6.  **Prediction Confidence Increases in Favor of Petitioner (Meta-Belief Updated):** My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome, which had been tempered by the Respondent's strong BIO, has now significantly increased. The SG has provided a compelling, textually and structurally sound argument that not only supports the Petitioner's position but also directly dismantles the Respondent's core defense and allays fears of runaway litigation. While the \"poor vehicle\" facts remain a potential off-ramp for a narrow ruling, the legal argument advanced by the SG is so clear and powerful that it makes a broad ruling in favor of the Petitioner's proposed standard appear much more likely. The central question is now whether the Respondent can convince the Court to look past the explicit command of \u00a7 1415(l).",

The current state reflects a sophisticated understanding of the case after processing the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO), which introduced significant counterarguments (e.g., 'poor vehicle', jurisdictional reading of \u00a7 1415(l)). However, the logical next step in the litigation process is the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This document is specifically designed to rebut the exact points raised in the BIO that have now tempered my beliefs. Foregoing this crucial piece of evidence to make a final prediction now would be a suboptimal move. The Reply Brief has a high potential to shift my posterior beliefs, especially regarding the likelihood of certiorari being granted. Therefore, finalizing the prediction now has very low Task EIG. Similarly, from a meta-learning perspective (Design EIG), I would learn very little. The most valuable design lesson comes from observing the full cert-stage briefing cycle (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) and then comparing the final belief state to the Court's action.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO), authored by elite counsel Lisa Blatt, provides the first direct articulation of the school district's defensive strategy. This allows me to move from inferring their arguments to analyzing their explicit legal and factual claims, placing them in direct opposition to the framework presented by the Petitioner and the Solicitor General (SG). My beliefs are now significantly more balanced and account for the primary counterarguments.\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Legal Conflict is Now Contested (Belief Sharpened):** While my belief that this case presents an issue of national importance remains, the BIO actively contests this premise. The Respondent argues there is \"no meaningful circuit split,\" framing the disagreement among the circuits as a matter of \"different verbal formulations\" for a uniformly high intent standard, rather than a substantive divide on the legal test itself. This reframes the debate from \"what should the standard be?\" to \"is there even a real problem for the Court to solve?\"\n\n2.  **Dueling Legal Frameworks Are Explicitly Defined (Belief Transformed):** I now have a clear view of the two competing models for liability.\n    *   **Petitioner/SG's Two-Tiered Model (Stable):** A *violation* of the ADA/Rehab Act requires no proof of intent, while obtaining *compensatory damages* requires showing \"deliberate indifference.\"\n    *   **Respondent's Context-Specific Model (New Evidence):** The Respondent rejects a universal standard. They argue that for the \"unique subset\" of ADA/Rehab Act claims that challenge the provision of educational services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a single, heightened standard of \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" is required to establish a *violation* in the first place. They contend this is necessary to harmonize the statutes and provide deference to the professional judgment of educators, citing the \"conceptual peculiarity\" of this overlap.\n\n3.  **The Central Conflict Crystallizes Around a Single Statutory Clause (Belief Hyper-Focused and Deepened):** My prior belief that 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l) is the lynchpin is strongly confirmed. The BIO directly confronts the SG's interpretation, creating a clear textual battleground.\n    *   **Petitioner/SG's Interpretation (Stable):** The clause's command to preserve the \"rights, procedures, and remedies\" of the ADA/Rehab Act is a substantive directive from Congress to apply those statutes' normal liability standards without modification.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Interpretation (New Evidence):** The BIO argues \u00a7 1415(l) is purely jurisdictional, not substantive. They claim it was enacted only to overrule *Smith v. Robinson* (which had made the IDEA the exclusive remedy), thereby confirming that suits under the ADA/Rehab Act are *permissible*. However, they argue the clause \"says nothing about the *substantive standards*\" for those suits. In their view, the standard must still be derived from judicial efforts to harmonize the statutes, which they argue correctly leads back to the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" test from *Monahan v. Nebraska*. The case may now turn entirely on which of these two readings of \u00a7 1415(l) the Court adopts.\n\n4.  **Respondent Weaponizes the Case Facts as a \"Poor Vehicle\" (Belief Added):** The BIO heavily emphasizes that this case is a poor vehicle for resolving the legal question. This is a powerful new defensive pillar. They argue:\n    *   The District made \"persistent efforts\" and \"reasonably responded\" to the student's needs, meaning the facts do not demonstrate discrimination under *any* standard.\n    *   The Petitioner has already received injunctive relief and monetary compensation for the denial of a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) in a separate IDEA lawsuit. The Respondent uses this to argue that a decision here would have little practical effect for the parties, making it an unsuitable case for the Court's limited resources. This provides the Court with a clear, fact-based \"off-ramp\" to deny certiorari or issue a narrow, fact-bound ruling.\n\n5.  **The Viability of *Monahan* is a Key Disputed Premise (Belief Sharpened):** The parties are now in direct opposition over the continued relevance of the Eighth Circuit's foundational *Monahan* decision.\n    *   **Petitioner/SG View (Stable):** *Monahan* is a pre-\u00a7 1415(l) artifact that has been superseded by Congress's explicit statutory command.\n    *   **Respondent View (New Evidence):** *Monahan* correctly established a harmonizing principle for this unique statutory context, and \u00a7 1415(l) did nothing to disturb that judicial balancing act. They present the 40-year-old *Monahan* standard as a stable, long-standing precedent that the Court should be reluctant to overturn.\n\n6.  **Prediction Confidence Tempered by Strong Cert-Stage Opposition (Meta-Belief Updated):** While the SG's brief provided a powerful textual path to reversal, the Respondent's BIO is exceptionally strong at the certiorari stage. It skillfully attempts to minimize the circuit split, offers a plausible counter-interpretation of the key statute, and\u2014most critically\u2014presents a compelling \"poor vehicle\" argument. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome on the merits remains, but my confidence that the Court will grant certiorari and reach the merits has decreased. The BIO provides the Court with multiple, well-articulated reasons to deny the petition and avoid the question entirely. The path to a pro-Respondent outcome (via cert denial) now appears significantly more plausible.",
