    "facts_of_the_case": "Simon Soto, a Marine Corps veteran with a combat-related disability, was medically retired in 2006 with less than 20 years of service. Although he became eligible for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in 2009 when he received his disability rating, he did not apply until 2016. The Navy used the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limitation period to calculate his retroactive payments, giving him payments dating back only to 2010 instead of to 2008 when Congress had expanded CRSC eligibility to veterans with less than 20 years of service. Soto filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and other similarly situated veterans who received only six years of back payments, arguing that the CRSC statute\u2019s own procedures should apply instead of the Barring Act\u2019s six-year limit.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to Soto\u2019s class, holding that the CRSC statute was more specific and therefore superseded the Barring Act. The court also applied the pro-veteran canon of statutory interpretation, resolving any doubt in favor of the veterans. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.",

This moves my belief from a general model of the conflict to the specific, nuanced arguments the Justices first considered. It is not a perfect 1.0 because it only presents one side of the argument; the government's response is still needed. For the design (Design EIG = 0.7), this action tests and confirms a core hypothesis: that analyzing cert-stage documents is the most efficient first step in SCOTUS prediction. It validates the strategy of starting with the document that frames the entire case for the Court, providing a strong signal about the value of this step in any future prediction task.

The \ngovernment has elected to calculate the period of ret-\nroactive compensation due using the procedure in the \nBarring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702) instead of the one in the \nCRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a)\u2014a maneuver that \nallows the government to apply the Barring Act\u2019s six-\nyear limitations period in order to pay the veterans \nless. But the Barring Act is a default provision and \ndoes not apply where \u201canother law\u201d provides a proce-\ndure for calculating the amount due\u2014that is, for \u201cset-\ntling\u201d a demand for payment. \nAlthough this Court\u2019s precedent defines \u201csettlement\u201d \nof demands for payment from the federal government \nas \u201cthe administrative determination of the amount \ndue,\u201d it has not decided the test for whether a statute \nprovides a settlement procedure that should apply in \nplace of the Barring Act. And agency practice more \nbroadly\u2014which aligns with the test the District Court \narticulated and is consistent with this Court\u2019s defini-\ntion of \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014is irreconcilable with the novel \ntest that the Federal Circuit applied, although both \ntests claim reliance on this Court\u2019s definition of \u201cset-\ntlement.\u201d  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhen a person makes a demand for money from the \nfederal government pursuant to federal statute, what \ntest should courts and agencies use to determine \nwhether that statute includes a settlement procedure \nthat displaces the default procedures and limitations \nset forth in the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702)? \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE \n29.6 STATEMENT \nSimon A.

The final judg-\nment of the District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas is unreported, but it is available at 2021 WL \n7286022 and reproduced at Pet.App.38a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Federal Circuit entered its judgment on Febru-\nary 12, 2024, Pet.App.1a. The Federal Circuit panel \ndenied Soto\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en banc on \nJune 20, 2024, Pet.App.40a. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL/STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet.App.42a-47a. The Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet.App.45a. The Com-\nbat-Related Special Compensation Act, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a is reproduced at Pet.App.42a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nIn 2002, Congress passed a law to provide an incred-\nibly deserving segment of the country\u2019s military veter-\nans\u2014veterans both injured in combat or other \n\n2 \n \nhazardous duty and who retired from the military be-\ncause they served at least twenty years (longevity re-\ntirees)\u2014with Combat-Related Special Compensation \n(\u201cCRSC\u201d). 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. That law, which Con-\ngress amended in 2008 to include veterans whose dis-\nabilities prevented further service (medical retirees), \ncontains all the provisions needed for the relevant fed-\neral agency to \u201csettle\u201d a claim for CRSC; that is, to de-\ntermine the amount due to a veteran who submits a \ndemand for payment. The Federal Circuit has ratified \nthe government\u2019s choice to substitute a default statute \nfor that determination\u2014the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3702)\u2014which applies only where another law does not \nprovide for settlement, and which, unlike the CRSC \nstatute, contains a six-year statute of limitations.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision is wrong in light of \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and has important and wide-\nranging implications that require this Court\u2019s inter-\nvention. This Court has defined settlement as \u201can ad-\nministrative determination of the amount due\u201d on a \ndemand for payment. Thus, in assessing whether an-\nother law displaces the Barring Act, this Court\u2019s test \nrequires only a determination of whether that law pro-\nvides a procedure for determining the amount due on \na demand for payment. The law need not specifically \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d or equivalent language, and it \nneed not include a limitations provision\u2014neither of \nwhich determine whether the law contains the rele-\nvant procedure. In holding otherwise, the Federal Cir-\ncuit leaves Petitioner\u2014and thousands of other  combat \nveterans who rendered heroic service to our nation \nthat left them with long-term, life-altering disabili-\nties\u2014without the full measure of compensation the na-\ntion promised in return for their sacrifices. The Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s novel test, if left untouched, also raises \ndifficult questions about whether other statutes under \n\n3 \n \nwhich agencies have been delegated the authority to \nsettle demands for payment in fact provide for that au-\nthority. This Court should grant the petition to ad-\ndress these exceptionally important matters. \nA. Statutory Background \nCongress enacted the CRSC program on December \n2, 2002, to provide benefits to members of the uni-\nformed services who have combat-related injuries. 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. In the years since its inception, CRSC \nhas been amended and expanded to provide benefits to \nthousands of veterans. In 2003, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act (\u201cNDAA\u201d) authorized CRSC for cer-\ntain military retirees with combat- or operations-re-\nlated disabilities. Id. The 2003 Act provided CRSC to \nretired service members with qualifying disabilities \nrated at 60% or higher, and to those retirees with dis-\nabilities associated with the award of a Purple Heart \ndecoration. Id. As originally enacted, the substantive \nentitlement to CRSC was payable only to longevity re-\ntirees (those who completed at least twenty years of \nservice). Pub. L. No. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392. \nToday\u2019s iteration of CRSC was signed into law under \nthe NDAA adopted on January 28, 2008 (2008 NDAA). \nUnder it, CRSC eligibility was expanded to anyone \nmedically retired, including retirees with fewer than \ntwenty years of service, effective January 1, 2008. Pub. \nL. No. 110-181, 122 Stat. 3.  \nThe CRSC Statute provides that \u201c[t]he Secretary \nconcerned shall pay . . . a monthly amount for the com-\nbat-related disability of the retiree determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a). The CRSC Stat-\nute goes on to establish how to determine the amount \nof monthly payment due, the maximum amount paya-\nble, who is eligible, the status of the payments, who \ncan prescribe application procedures, and the source of \n\n4 \n \nthe payments. Id. By its own terms, the CRSC Statute \nnot only determines who is eligible, but also provides \nthe framework to administratively determine how \nmuch CRSC is due to an eligible veteran and the pro-\ncedure by which that determination should be made. \nThe Barring Act is an \u201cindependent administrative \nclaims handling procedure\u201d See U.S. Gov\u2019t Accounta-\nbility Off., GAO-08-978SP, Principles of Federal Ap-\npropriations Law 14-25 n.54 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red \nBook\u201d). The Barring Act provides for a six-year statute \nof limitations. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Importantly, \nhowever, the Barring Act makes clear that its limita-\ntions period does not apply where \u201canother law\u201d estab-\nlishes how \u201cclaims\u201d against the United States \u201cshall be \nsettled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a). In other words, if \u201canother law\u201d \nincludes its own settlement procedure, the Barring \nAct\u2014and its six-year limitations period\u2014do not apply \nto claims under that law.  \nB. Factual Background \nThe pertinent facts are not in dispute. Mr. Soto en-\nlisted in the United States Marine Corps in August \n2000. Pet.App.22a. During his first two tours in Oper-\nation Iraqi Freedom, he served in Mortuary Affairs \nand was assigned to \u201csearch for, recover, and process \nthe remains\u201d of war casualties.\u201d Id. He began experi-\nencing, inter alia, suicidal thoughts, vivid nightmares, \nand difficulty concentrating as a result of his experi-\nences in Mortuary Affairs, including one mission in \nwhich he and other service members retrieved \u201cover \n300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who had been \nkilled. Complaint \u00b6 55, Soto v. United States, No. 1:17-\ncv-51 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 2, 2017), ECF No. 1. He began \nbeing treated for his afflictions in December 2005. Id. \n\u00b6 57. His physicians at that time documented the cor-\nrelation between his distressing combat experiences in \n\n5 \n \nIraq and his later diagnosis of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).  \nAfter serving in the Marine Corps, Mr. Soto was \nmedically retired from active duty on April 28, 2006. \nPet.App.22a. Due to the lasting effects of his service, \nhe was then placed on the Temporary Disability Re-\ntirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), which entitled him to military \nretirement pay. Id. Subsequently, the Secretary of the \nU.S. Navy (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) removed Mr. Soto from the \nTDRL and gave him permanent disability retirement, \nwhich continued his entitlement to military retire-\nment pay. Id.  \nLater, Mr. Soto sought service-connected disability \nbenefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (the \n\u201cVA\u201d) based on his PTSD. Complaint \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2009). Id.  \nIn June 2016, Mr. Soto submitted an application to \nthe Navy seeking CRSC due to his PTSD. Pet.App.22a. \nIn October 2016, the Navy found that his PTSD was a \ncombat-related disability and awarded him CRSC. Id. \nThe Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July 2010, \nPet.App.4a, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Soto \nmet all of the CRSC enrollment criteria on January 1, \n2008\u2014the effective date of the law that extended the \nCRSC entitled to medical retirees such as Mr. Soto. \nComplaint \u00b6 61. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201\u20141222; id. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)(3)B). As a result of the Navy\u2019s assignment \nof Mr. Soto\u2019s CRSC effective July 2010, the Secretary \nawarded Mr. Soto only six years of retroactive CRSC \npayments\u2014carrying from July 2010 to June 2016\u2014\neven though he is entitled to approximately eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC payments\u2014from \n\n6 \n \nJanuary 2008 until June 2016. Complaint \u00b6 61. Docu-\nmentation recording the Secretary\u2019s decision provided:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions [United States Code (U.S.C. 31, Section \n3702(b)]. In order to receive the full retroactive \nCRSC entitlement, you must file your CRSC claim \nwithin 6 years of any VA rating decision that \ncould potentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired pay, \nwhichever is most recent. If you file your claim \nmore than 6 years after the initial eligibility, you \nwill be restricted to 6 years of any retroactive en-\ntitlement.  \nId. \u00b6 35. Defendant has used this six-year statute of \nlimitations policy to pay no more than six years of ret-\nroactive CRSC to thousands of other deserving United \nStates military combat veterans.   \nC. The Proceedings Below \nOn March 2, 2017, Mr. Soto filed a putative class ac-\ntion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Texas asserting a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (the \u201cCRSC Statute\u201d) based on Defendant\u2019s \n\u201cnationwide and unlawful policy to pay no more than \nsix years of retroactive CRSC\u201d (the \u201cRetroactive Pay-\nment Cap\u201d). Complaint at 1. The putative nationwide \nclass consisted of:  \nformer service members of the United States \nArmy, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast \nGuard whose CRSC applications under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a were granted, but whose amount of CRSC \npayment was limited by Defendant\u2019s application \nof the statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3702 and have a claim less than $10,000.  \n\n7 \n \nPet.App.31a.  After denying Defendant\u2019s Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings, see Pet.App.32a, the Dis-\ntrict Court certified the proposed class on February 11, \n2019. Pet.App.31a. In response to discovery requests, \nthe government identified 9,108 former service mem-\nbers whose CRSC had been limited by its application \nof the Barring Act.1 Joint Statement of Stipulated \nFacts \u00b6 3, Soto v. United States, No. 1:17-cv-51 (S.D. \nTex. Aug. 13, 2021), ECF No. 87. The Claims Adminis-\ntrator mailed the potential class members notices \nwhich advised them that they had until July 5, 2021 \nto opt out of the Class. At the conclusion of the notifi-\ncation process, 11 of the 9,108 service members opted \nout of the Class.  \nAfter four years of litigation, the District Court \ngranted summary judgment to Mr. Soto on December \n16, 2021. Pet.App.39a. In its order, the court held that \nthe CRSC Statute has its own settlement mechanism \n\u201cbecause it defines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d Pet.App.35a-36a. Based on \nthat conclusion, the District Court held that the CRSC \nStatute is a \u201canother law,\u201d placing it outside the reach \nof the Barring Act and\u2014by extension\u2014its six-year \nstatute of limitations. Pet.App.35a. The court entered \nfinal judgment in favor of Mr. Soto and the Class, find-\ning that Defendant is liable to the veterans for com-\npensation that Defendant withheld when applying its \nRetroactive Payment Cap. Pet.App.38a.  \n \n1 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government that was current as of \n2021. The number of affected veterans has likely increased in the \nthree years since that information was collected.  \n\n8 \n \nDefendant appealed the District Court\u2019s final judg-\nment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Cir-\ncuit on October 12, 2022. Pet.App.5a.  \nThe Federal Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s \ngrant of summary judgment to Mr. Soto and the Class \nin a split decision. Pet.App.11a. A majority of the Fed-\neral Circuit panel held that that the Barring Act\u2019s six-\nyear statute of limitations applies because the CRSC \nStatute does not contain its own settlement mecha-\nnism. Id. The majority agreed with the District Court \nthat the CRSC Statute established eligibility for CRSC \npayments, and did not contest that the statute \u201chelps \nexplain the amount of benefits.\u201d Pet.App.6a. But it \nwent on to hold that establishing eligibility was differ-\nent from \u201cconfer[ring] settlement authority independ-\nent of the Barring Act\u201d\u2014and did not specifically ana-\nlyze the statute\u2019s provisions governing the amount of \nbenefits owed. Id. The majority explained that a stat-\nute \u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the au-\nthority to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nwhich the majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by use \nof the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.6a-7a (emphases added). \nIt also held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the \nCRSC statute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 pro-\nvision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet.App.7a \n(cleaned up). Because the CRSC Statute did not meet \neither requirement, the majority held that it did not \nqualify as a \u201canother law.\u201d Id. (\u201cAs we have explained, \nthe CRSC statute does not meet either of these re-\nquirements.\u201d). Id. \nNotably, the majority did not square its disjunctive \ntest with this Court\u2019s teaching that the term \u201csettle-\nment\u201d is used to \u201cdescribe administrative determina-\ntion of the amount due.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States \nex rel. Peeler, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916). Nor is it other-\nwise clear how the majority\u2019s newly created test is \n\n9 \n \nderivable from that decision, which nowhere discusses \nor suggests either requirement when defining the term \n\u201csettlement.\u201d \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet.App.12a. He opined that \nthe \u201cCRSC statute addresses the settlement of claims \nagainst the government and displaces the Barring \nAct\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.\u201d Id. After citing \nIll. Surety and other authority regarding the defini-\ntions of \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d Judge Reyna concluded \nthat \u201c\u2018[s]ettling a claim,\u2019 therefore, means administra-\ntively determining the validity of the demand for \nmoney against the government and the amount of \nmoney due.\u201d Pet.App.13a. He then undertook a com-\nprehensive review the CRSC Statute, finding that it \ndefined eligibility; granted the \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d \nthe authority to determine an amount due to an eligi-\nble veteran; described how to determine the monthly \namount due to be paid; and identified the source of the \nCRSC payments. Pet.App.15a. Following from that \nanalysis, he concluded that the CRSC Statute provides \na settlement mechanism and displaces the Barring \nAct. Pet.App.12a. Pertinent here, Judge Reyna criti-\ncized the majority\u2019s creation of \u201cnew requirements for \ndetermining when a statute settles a government \nclaim,\u201d including the majority\u2019s undue focus on the \nword \u201csettle,\u201d even in contexts where the use of that \nword is not required, i.e., in situations involving \u201cmore \ngeneral, remedial, and administrative determination \nof [the] eligibility for money from the government and \nthe amount due.\u201d Pet.App.12a, 18a. \n\n10 \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS VITALLY \nIMPORTANT BECAUSE THE TEST FOR \nWHETHER A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT \nMUST BE SETTLED UNDER THE BARRING \nACT OR ANOTHER STATUTE MERITS THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.  \nWhether thousands of combat veterans now and into \nthe future lose all or part of the special compensation \nthey earned through service to and sacrifice for our na-\ntion is an exceptionally important question that merits \nthis Court\u2019s review. That is so for two independent rea-\nsons.  \nA. The question is exceptionally important \nbecause it determines the scope of a stat-\nute that provides remuneration for thou-\nsands of disabled combat veterans who \nhave made life-altering sacrifices for the \nnation.   \n1. The military retirement system accomplishes at \nleast two core goals: it ensures fairness by rewarding \nthe service and sacrifices of veterans, and it makes a \ncareer in the Armed Forces more competitive with op-\nportunities with private employers and the federal \nCivil Service. Both goals support recruitment and re-\ntention efforts and thereby protect national security. \nSee Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL34751, Military Retirement: \nBackground and Recent Developments 1 (June 3, 2024) \n(outlining fundamental purposes of the military retire-\nment system). CRSC\u2014and questions affecting its \nscope and reliability\u2014are particularly important to \nthese goals, for two interrelated reasons.  \nFirst, CRSC focuses specifically on exceptionally \nworthy beneficiaries: Purple Heart recipients and oth-\ners who were injured in combat or particularly \n\n11 \n \nhazardous service. Example duties include those asso-\nciated with confronting hostile forces, diving, para-\nchuting, and using explosives or other dangerous ma-\nterials. Example injuries include those sustained at \nthe hands of a hostile force, munitions explosions, in-\nhalation of toxic gases, or those resulting from use of \nmilitary vehicles, ships, or aircraft. See K. Kamarck & \nM. Schwartz, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R40589, Concurrent \nReceipt of Military Retired Pay and Veteran Disability: \nBackground and Issues for Congress 6 (June 22, 2023). \nAs of 2021, the CRSC program provided economic sup-\nport for over 95,000 veterans injured in these ways, \nover half of whom were between 90 and 100 percent \ndisabled. See id. at 7 (reporting number of recipients \nby disability rating). Nearly half of them\u201445,000\u2014\nwere 100 percent disabled. See id. In other words, \nCRSC beneficiaries are among those living veterans \nwho have risked the most and sacrificed the most\u2014a \npopulation highly deserving of support.  \nSecond, CRSC is landmark legislation in the veter-\nans community. It is the result of over a decade of ad-\nvocacy among veterans, veterans\u2019 advocacy organiza-\ntions, and members of Congress, and is the first form \nof \u201cconcurrent receipt\u201d\u2014simultaneous receipt of VA \ndisability and mili\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \ngovernment has elected to calculate the period of ret-\nroactive compensation due using the procedure in the \nBarring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702) instead of the one in the \nCRSC statute (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a)\u2014a maneuver that \nallows the government to apply the Barring Act\u2019s six-\nyear limitations period in order to pay the veterans \nless. But the Barring Act is a default provision and \ndoes not apply where \u201canother law\u201d provides a proce-\ndure for calculating the amount due\u2014that is, for \u201cset-\ntling\u201d a demand for payment. \nAlthough this Court\u2019s precedent defines \u201csettlement\u201d \nof demands for payment from the federal government \nas \u201cthe administrative determination of the amount \ndue,\u201d it has not decided the test for whether a statute \nprovides a settlement procedure that should apply in \nplace of the Barring Act. And agency practice more \nbroadly\u2014which aligns with the test the District Court \narticulated and is consistent with this Court\u2019s defini-\ntion of \u201csettlement\u201d\u2014is irreconcilable with the novel \ntest that the Federal Circuit applied, although both \ntests claim reliance on this Court\u2019s definition of \u201cset-\ntlement.\u201d  \nThe question presented is:  \nWhen a person makes a demand for money from the \nfederal government pursuant to federal statute, what \ntest should courts and agencies use to determine \nwhether that statute includes a settlement procedure \nthat displaces the default procedures and limitations \nset forth in the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702)? \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE \n29.6 STATEMENT \nSimon A.

The final judg-\nment of the District Court for the Southern District of \nTexas is unreported, but it is available at 2021 WL \n7286022 and reproduced at Pet.App.38a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Federal Circuit entered its judgment on Febru-\nary 12, 2024, Pet.App.1a. The Federal Circuit panel \ndenied Soto\u2019s timely petition for rehearing en banc on \nJune 20, 2024, Pet.App.40a. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL/STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at Pet.App.42a-47a. The Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3702, is reproduced at Pet.App.45a. The Com-\nbat-Related Special Compensation Act, 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a is reproduced at Pet.App.42a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nIn 2002, Congress passed a law to provide an incred-\nibly deserving segment of the country\u2019s military veter-\nans\u2014veterans both injured in combat or other \n\n2 \n \nhazardous duty and who retired from the military be-\ncause they served at least twenty years (longevity re-\ntirees)\u2014with Combat-Related Special Compensation \n(\u201cCRSC\u201d). 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. That law, which Con-\ngress amended in 2008 to include veterans whose dis-\nabilities prevented further service (medical retirees), \ncontains all the provisions needed for the relevant fed-\neral agency to \u201csettle\u201d a claim for CRSC; that is, to de-\ntermine the amount due to a veteran who submits a \ndemand for payment. The Federal Circuit has ratified \nthe government\u2019s choice to substitute a default statute \nfor that determination\u2014the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3702)\u2014which applies only where another law does not \nprovide for settlement, and which, unlike the CRSC \nstatute, contains a six-year statute of limitations.  \nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision is wrong in light of \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and has important and wide-\nranging implications that require this Court\u2019s inter-\nvention. This Court has defined settlement as \u201can ad-\nministrative determination of the amount due\u201d on a \ndemand for payment. Thus, in assessing whether an-\nother law displaces the Barring Act, this Court\u2019s test \nrequires only a determination of whether that law pro-\nvides a procedure for determining the amount due on \na demand for payment. The law need not specifically \nuse the word \u201csettle\u201d or equivalent language, and it \nneed not include a limitations provision\u2014neither of \nwhich determine whether the law contains the rele-\nvant procedure. In holding otherwise, the Federal Cir-\ncuit leaves Petitioner\u2014and thousands of other  combat \nveterans who rendered heroic service to our nation \nthat left them with long-term, life-altering disabili-\nties\u2014without the full measure of compensation the na-\ntion promised in return for their sacrifices. The Fed-\neral Circuit\u2019s novel test, if left untouched, also raises \ndifficult questions about whether other statutes under \n\n3 \n \nwhich agencies have been delegated the authority to \nsettle demands for payment in fact provide for that au-\nthority. This Court should grant the petition to ad-\ndress these exceptionally important matters. \nA. Statutory Background \nCongress enacted the CRSC program on December \n2, 2002, to provide benefits to members of the uni-\nformed services who have combat-related injuries. 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1413a. In the years since its inception, CRSC \nhas been amended and expanded to provide benefits to \nthousands of veterans. In 2003, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act (\u201cNDAA\u201d) authorized CRSC for cer-\ntain military retirees with combat- or operations-re-\nlated disabilities. Id. The 2003 Act provided CRSC to \nretired service members with qualifying disabilities \nrated at 60% or higher, and to those retirees with dis-\nabilities associated with the award of a Purple Heart \ndecoration. Id. As originally enacted, the substantive \nentitlement to CRSC was payable only to longevity re-\ntirees (those who completed at least twenty years of \nservice). Pub. L. No. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392. \nToday\u2019s iteration of CRSC was signed into law under \nthe NDAA adopted on January 28, 2008 (2008 NDAA). \nUnder it, CRSC eligibility was expanded to anyone \nmedically retired, including retirees with fewer than \ntwenty years of service, effective January 1, 2008. Pub. \nL. No. 110-181, 122 Stat. 3.  \nThe CRSC Statute provides that \u201c[t]he Secretary \nconcerned shall pay . . . a monthly amount for the com-\nbat-related disability of the retiree determined under \nsubsection (b).\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a(a). The CRSC Stat-\nute goes on to establish how to determine the amount \nof monthly payment due, the maximum amount paya-\nble, who is eligible, the status of the payments, who \ncan prescribe application procedures, and the source of \n\n4 \n \nthe payments. Id. By its own terms, the CRSC Statute \nnot only determines who is eligible, but also provides \nthe framework to administratively determine how \nmuch CRSC is due to an eligible veteran and the pro-\ncedure by which that determination should be made. \nThe Barring Act is an \u201cindependent administrative \nclaims handling procedure\u201d See U.S. Gov\u2019t Accounta-\nbility Off., GAO-08-978SP, Principles of Federal Ap-\npropriations Law 14-25 n.54 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cGAO Red \nBook\u201d). The Barring Act provides for a six-year statute \nof limitations. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)(1). Importantly, \nhowever, the Barring Act makes clear that its limita-\ntions period does not apply where \u201canother law\u201d estab-\nlishes how \u201cclaims\u201d against the United States \u201cshall be \nsettled.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3702(a). In other words, if \u201canother law\u201d \nincludes its own settlement procedure, the Barring \nAct\u2014and its six-year limitations period\u2014do not apply \nto claims under that law.  \nB. Factual Background \nThe pertinent facts are not in dispute. Mr. Soto en-\nlisted in the United States Marine Corps in August \n2000. Pet.App.22a. During his first two tours in Oper-\nation Iraqi Freedom, he served in Mortuary Affairs \nand was assigned to \u201csearch for, recover, and process \nthe remains\u201d of war casualties.\u201d Id. He began experi-\nencing, inter alia, suicidal thoughts, vivid nightmares, \nand difficulty concentrating as a result of his experi-\nences in Mortuary Affairs, including one mission in \nwhich he and other service members retrieved \u201cover \n300 pieces of five or seven soldiers\u201d who had been \nkilled. Complaint \u00b6 55, Soto v. United States, No. 1:17-\ncv-51 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 2, 2017), ECF No. 1. He began \nbeing treated for his afflictions in December 2005. Id. \n\u00b6 57. His physicians at that time documented the cor-\nrelation between his distressing combat experiences in \n\n5 \n \nIraq and his later diagnosis of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).  \nAfter serving in the Marine Corps, Mr. Soto was \nmedically retired from active duty on April 28, 2006. \nPet.App.22a. Due to the lasting effects of his service, \nhe was then placed on the Temporary Disability Re-\ntirement List (\u201cTDRL\u201d), which entitled him to military \nretirement pay. Id. Subsequently, the Secretary of the \nU.S. Navy (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) removed Mr. Soto from the \nTDRL and gave him permanent disability retirement, \nwhich continued his entitlement to military retire-\nment pay. Id.  \nLater, Mr. Soto sought service-connected disability \nbenefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (the \n\u201cVA\u201d) based on his PTSD. Complaint \u00b6 59. In June \n2009, the VA issued a rating decision awarding him \ndisability rating of 50 percent for his PTSD (effective \nApril 26, 2006), followed by a rating of 30 percent (ef-\nfective November 1, 2006), and then a rating of 100 \npercent (effective December 31, 2009). Id.  \nIn June 2016, Mr. Soto submitted an application to \nthe Navy seeking CRSC due to his PTSD. Pet.App.22a. \nIn October 2016, the Navy found that his PTSD was a \ncombat-related disability and awarded him CRSC. Id. \nThe Navy assigned a CRSC effective date of July 2010, \nPet.App.4a, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Soto \nmet all of the CRSC enrollment criteria on January 1, \n2008\u2014the effective date of the law that extended the \nCRSC entitled to medical retirees such as Mr. Soto. \nComplaint \u00b6 61. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201\u20141222; id. \n\u00a7 1413a(b)(3)B). As a result of the Navy\u2019s assignment \nof Mr. Soto\u2019s CRSC effective July 2010, the Secretary \nawarded Mr. Soto only six years of retroactive CRSC \npayments\u2014carrying from July 2010 to June 2016\u2014\neven though he is entitled to approximately eight-and-\none-half years of retroactive CRSC payments\u2014from \n\n6 \n \nJanuary 2008 until June 2016. Complaint \u00b6 61. Docu-\nmentation recording the Secretary\u2019s decision provided:  \nCRSC is subject to the 6-year statute of limita-\ntions [United States Code (U.S.C. 31, Section \n3702(b)]. In order to receive the full retroactive \nCRSC entitlement, you must file your CRSC claim \nwithin 6 years of any VA rating decision that \ncould potentially make you eligible for CRSC or \nthe date you became entitled to retired pay, \nwhichever is most recent. If you file your claim \nmore than 6 years after the initial eligibility, you \nwill be restricted to 6 years of any retroactive en-\ntitlement.  \nId. \u00b6 35. Defendant has used this six-year statute of \nlimitations policy to pay no more than six years of ret-\nroactive CRSC to thousands of other deserving United \nStates military combat veterans.   \nC. The Proceedings Below \nOn March 2, 2017, Mr. Soto filed a putative class ac-\ntion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District \nof Texas asserting a single claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a (the \u201cCRSC Statute\u201d) based on Defendant\u2019s \n\u201cnationwide and unlawful policy to pay no more than \nsix years of retroactive CRSC\u201d (the \u201cRetroactive Pay-\nment Cap\u201d). Complaint at 1. The putative nationwide \nclass consisted of:  \nformer service members of the United States \nArmy, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast \nGuard whose CRSC applications under 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1413a were granted, but whose amount of CRSC \npayment was limited by Defendant\u2019s application \nof the statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3702 and have a claim less than $10,000.  \n\n7 \n \nPet.App.31a.  After denying Defendant\u2019s Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings, see Pet.App.32a, the Dis-\ntrict Court certified the proposed class on February 11, \n2019. Pet.App.31a. In response to discovery requests, \nthe government identified 9,108 former service mem-\nbers whose CRSC had been limited by its application \nof the Barring Act.1 Joint Statement of Stipulated \nFacts \u00b6 3, Soto v. United States, No. 1:17-cv-51 (S.D. \nTex. Aug. 13, 2021), ECF No. 87. The Claims Adminis-\ntrator mailed the potential class members notices \nwhich advised them that they had until July 5, 2021 \nto opt out of the Class. At the conclusion of the notifi-\ncation process, 11 of the 9,108 service members opted \nout of the Class.  \nAfter four years of litigation, the District Court \ngranted summary judgment to Mr. Soto on December \n16, 2021. Pet.App.39a. In its order, the court held that \nthe CRSC Statute has its own settlement mechanism \n\u201cbecause it defines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d Pet.App.35a-36a. Based on \nthat conclusion, the District Court held that the CRSC \nStatute is a \u201canother law,\u201d placing it outside the reach \nof the Barring Act and\u2014by extension\u2014its six-year \nstatute of limitations. Pet.App.35a. The court entered \nfinal judgment in favor of Mr. Soto and the Class, find-\ning that Defendant is liable to the veterans for com-\npensation that Defendant withheld when applying its \nRetroactive Payment Cap. Pet.App.38a.  \n \n1 The number of class members described above is based on in-\nformation provided by the government that was current as of \n2021. The number of affected veterans has likely increased in the \nthree years since that information was collected.  \n\n8 \n \nDefendant appealed the District Court\u2019s final judg-\nment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Cir-\ncuit on October 12, 2022. Pet.App.5a.  \nThe Federal Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s \ngrant of summary judgment to Mr. Soto and the Class \nin a split decision. Pet.App.11a. A majority of the Fed-\neral Circuit panel held that that the Barring Act\u2019s six-\nyear statute of limitations applies because the CRSC \nStatute does not contain its own settlement mecha-\nnism. Id. The majority agreed with the District Court \nthat the CRSC Statute established eligibility for CRSC \npayments, and did not contest that the statute \u201chelps \nexplain the amount of benefits.\u201d Pet.App.6a. But it \nwent on to hold that establishing eligibility was differ-\nent from \u201cconfer[ring] settlement authority independ-\nent of the Barring Act\u201d\u2014and did not specifically ana-\nlyze the statute\u2019s provisions governing the amount of \nbenefits owed. Id. The majority explained that a stat-\nute \u201cmust explicitly grant an agency or entity the au-\nthority to settle claims\u201d using \u201cspecific language,\u201d \nwhich the majority stated \u201cwill typically be done by use \nof the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.6a-7a (emphases added). \nIt also held that \u201c[w]ithout specific language,\u201d the \nCRSC statute would need to \u201cprovide[] a \u2018specific\u2019 pro-\nvision setting out the period of recovery.\u201d Pet.App.7a \n(cleaned up). Because the CRSC Statute did not meet \neither requirement, the majority held that it did not \nqualify as a \u201canother law.\u201d Id. (\u201cAs we have explained, \nthe CRSC statute does not meet either of these re-\nquirements.\u201d). Id. \nNotably, the majority did not square its disjunctive \ntest with this Court\u2019s teaching that the term \u201csettle-\nment\u201d is used to \u201cdescribe administrative determina-\ntion of the amount due.\u201d Ill. Sur. Co. v. United States \nex rel. Peeler, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916). Nor is it other-\nwise clear how the majority\u2019s newly created test is \n\n9 \n \nderivable from that decision, which nowhere discusses \nor suggests either requirement when defining the term \n\u201csettlement.\u201d \nJudge Reyna dissented. Pet.App.12a. He opined that \nthe \u201cCRSC statute addresses the settlement of claims \nagainst the government and displaces the Barring \nAct\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.\u201d Id. After citing \nIll. Surety and other authority regarding the defini-\ntions of \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim,\u201d Judge Reyna concluded \nthat \u201c\u2018[s]ettling a claim,\u2019 therefore, means administra-\ntively determining the validity of the demand for \nmoney against the government and the amount of \nmoney due.\u201d Pet.App.13a. He then undertook a com-\nprehensive review the CRSC Statute, finding that it \ndefined eligibility; granted the \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d \nthe authority to determine an amount due to an eligi-\nble veteran; described how to determine the monthly \namount due to be paid; and identified the source of the \nCRSC payments. Pet.App.15a. Following from that \nanalysis, he concluded that the CRSC Statute provides \na settlement mechanism and displaces the Barring \nAct. Pet.App.12a. Pertinent here, Judge Reyna criti-\ncized the majority\u2019s creation of \u201cnew requirements for \ndetermining when a statute settles a government \nclaim,\u201d including the majority\u2019s undue focus on the \nword \u201csettle,\u201d even in contexts where the use of that \nword is not required, i.e., in situations involving \u201cmore \ngeneral, remedial, and administrative determination \nof [the] eligibility for money from the government and \nthe amount due.\u201d Pet.App.12a, 18a. \n\n10 \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS VITALLY \nIMPORTANT BECAUSE THE TEST FOR \nWHETHER A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT \nMUST BE SETTLED UNDER THE BARRING \nACT OR ANOTHER STATUTE MERITS THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.  \nWhether thousands of combat veterans now and into \nthe future lose all or part of the special compensation \nthey earned through service to and sacrifice for our na-\ntion is an exceptionally important question that merits \nthis Court\u2019s review. That is so for two independent rea-\nsons.  \nA. The question is exceptionally important \nbecause it determines the scope of a stat-\nute that provides remuneration for thou-\nsands of disabled combat veterans who \nhave made life-altering sacrifices for the \nnation.   \n1. The military retirement system accomplishes at \nleast two core goals: it ensures fairness by rewarding \nthe service and sacrifices of veterans, and it makes a \ncareer in the Armed Forces more competitive with op-\nportunities with private employers and the federal \nCivil Service. Both goals support recruitment and re-\ntention efforts and thereby protect national security. \nSee Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL34751, Military Retirement: \nBackground and Recent Developments 1 (June 3, 2024) \n(outlining fundamental purposes of the military retire-\nment system). CRSC\u2014and questions affecting its \nscope and reliability\u2014are particularly important to \nthese goals, for two interrelated reasons.  \nFirst, CRSC focuses specifically on exceptionally \nworthy beneficiaries: Purple Heart recipients and oth-\ners who were injured in combat or particularly \n\n11 \n \nhazardous service. Example duties include those asso-\nciated with confronting hostile forces, diving, para-\nchuting, and using explosives or other dangerous ma-\nterials. Example injuries include those sustained at \nthe hands of a hostile force, munitions explosions, in-\nhalation of toxic gases, or those resulting from use of \nmilitary vehicles, ships, or aircraft. See K. Kamarck & \nM. Schwartz, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R40589, Concurrent \nReceipt of Military Retired Pay and Veteran Disability: \nBackground and Issues for Congress 6 (June 22, 2023). \nAs of 2021, the CRSC program provided economic sup-\nport for over 95,000 veterans injured in these ways, \nover half of whom were between 90 and 100 percent \ndisabled. See id. at 7 (reporting number of recipients \nby disability rating). Nearly half of them\u201445,000\u2014\nwere 100 percent disabled. See id. In other words, \nCRSC beneficiaries are among those living veterans \nwho have risked the most and sacrificed the most\u2014a \npopulation highly deserving of support.  \nSecond, CRSC is landmark legislation in the veter-\nans community. It is the result of over a decade of ad-\nvocacy among veterans, veterans\u2019 advocacy organiza-\ntions, and members of Congress, and is the first form \nof \u201cconcurrent receipt\u201d\u2014simultaneous receipt of VA \ndisability and military retired pay\u2014that Congress au-\nthorized since prohibiting the practice in 1892. See id. \nat 1 & n.2. As originally conceived in the House and \nSenate, the program had a much broader scope; CRSC \nas it exists is a compromise forged in the shadow of a \nveto threat, the linchpin of which is fairness to those \nwhose service and sacrifice was especially significant. \nSee U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., Compensation Elements and \nRelated Manpower Cost Items: Their Purpose and \nLegislative Backgrounds 619 (7th ed. Nov. 2011) (de-\nscribing legislative history and fundamental purpose \nof CRSC). For these reasons, CRSC has symbolic \n\n12 \n \nimportance in veterans\u2019 circles as a particularly crys-\ntallized example of the nation\u2019s commitment to equity \nin rewarding service and sacrifice. \n2. That commitment and its contribution to national \nsecurity are at stake in this case. As the Department \nof Defense has observed, \u201c[f]ew things are more im-\nportant for morale than that service members believe \nthey are being treated as fairly as possible, and, con-\nversely, few things undermine morale more than a \nsense of unfair treatment.\u201d Id. at 3. This class action \nexists because thousands of deserving veterans have \nthat sense of unfair treatment. The Question Pre-\nsented will determine whether those veterans receive \nthe full CRSC benefits that they indisputably earned, \nor whether an interpretation of the word \u201csettlement\u201d \nthat is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s definition of that \nterm will provide an extrinsic limit on the CRSC pro-\ngram\u2019s landmark commitment. The answer has impli-\ncations for the legitimacy that the promises of a grate-\nful nation will have among veterans and prospective \nmilitary members, and so for the country\u2019s military \nreadiness. For that reason alone, this case is excep-\ntionally important. \nB. The question is exceptionally important \nbecause the Federal Circuit\u2019s test alters \nhow and even whether the federal gov-\nernment settles its debts. \nThe Federal Circuit held that a statute can only pro-\nvide a settlement mechanism that displaces the Bar-\nring Act if it (1) uses \u201cspecific language\u201d that will \u201ctyp-\nically\u201d involve the term \u201csettle\u201d or (2) specifically sets \nout a period of recovery. Pet.App.18a (Reyna, J., dis-\nsenting). But other statutes that agencies and courts \nhave long regarded as providing their own settlement \nmechanism do not meet one or both of these require-\nments\u2014meaning that the Federal Circuit\u2019s test, if left \n\n13 \n \nin place by this Court, would cause a sea change. See, \ne.g., Lee v. DOJ, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, 265 (M.S.P.B. July \n15, 2005) (noting that predecessor to Section 3702 did \nnot prevent MSPB from awarding back pay because 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(1) constituted \u201canother law\u201d that dis-\nplaced the Barring Act, and reviewing caselaw); 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5596 (authorizing the MSPB to determine el-\nigibility for and award backpay, providing guidance for \ncalculation of amount due, but not using the word \u201cset-\ntle\u201d or similar language)2; File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (Off. of Pers. Mgmt. June 16, \n1999) (concluding that Office of Personnel Manage-\nment lacked jurisdiction under Section 3702(a) to set-\ntle claim relating to \u201clawfulness of a separation based \non the expiration of a temporary appointment\u201d be-\ncause the MSPB was \u201cauthorized by [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n7513(d)] to review\u201d such matters); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 (au-\nthorizing appeal to the MSPB in subsection (d), but no-\nwhere using the word \u201csettle\u201d or similar language).  \nThe case of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712 is particularly instruc-\ntive. That statute, formerly codified at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n4712, addresses claims for the proceeds of effects of \npersons who pass away in locations under Army juris-\ndiction. A prior version of that statute included a sub-\nsection (g), which used the word \u201csettlement\u201d to vest \nauthority in the GAO to address claims. See 10 U.S.C. \n \n2 The government suggested in its response to the Petition for Re-\nhearing before the Federal Circuit that Petitioner\u2019s discussion of \nclaims for back pay under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596 referred to the Uni-\nformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \n(USERRA). Response at 12, Soto v. United States, No. 22-2011 \n(Fed. Cir. May 5, 2024). That is wrong. USERRA is codified at 38 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4324(c), was not discussed in the Petition for Rehearing, \nand is not discussed here. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596 codifies the Back Pay \nAct\u2014a wholly separate statute that includes neither the word \n\u201csettle\u201d nor any limitations period.  \n\n14 \n \n\u00a7 4712 amended by General Accounting Office Act of \n1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 Stat. 3826 (1996) (cur-\nrent version at 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7712). Congress struck that \nsubsection with the intent to transfer that authority \nfrom GAO to the Department of Defense (DoD). See \n110 Stat. at 3842, \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202(g) (noting that \u201c[t]he \npurpose of this title is to amend provisions of law to \nreflect, update, and enact transfers and subsequent \ndelegations of functions . . . as in effect immediately \nbefore this title takes effect,\u201d and striking subsection \n(g)); In re Transfer Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, 97-1 Comp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, at \n*9 (Mar. 17, 1997) (acknowledging that 110 Stat. 3826 \ntransferred settlement authority for claims under 10 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 4712 to DoD). \nThe result of Congress\u2019s amendment is a statute that \nneither uses the word \u201csettle\u201d nor anything similar, \nand which does not contain a specific limitations pe-\nriod. Before the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in Soto, that \ndid not matter. But under the majority\u2019s novel test, \nCongress\u2019s transfer must be understood as removing \nsettlement authority from Section 7712 altogether, \nleaving claims under it subject to Section 3702. Section \n3702(a)\u2019s language specifically addresses particular \nkinds of claims in its subsections, see 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3702(a)(1)\u2013(3), and assigns any claims it does not spe-\ncifically address to the Office of Management and \nBudget. See id. \u00a7 3702(a)(4). And since claims for pro-\nceeds of personal effects are not specifically discussed \nin Section 3702(a), they would presumably fall under \nthe authority of the Office of Management and Budget \npursuant to Section 3702(a)(4)\u2014notwithstanding Con-\ngress\u2019s plain intent to leave them in the hands of DoD. \nIn sum, the potentially expansive implications of the \nFederal Circuit\u2019s decision\u2014one that would upend ex-\nisting congressional delegations of claims and cause \n\n15 \n \ncourts and agencies alike to revisit the settlement au-\nthority of numerous statutes\u2014further support the ex-\nceptional importance of this petition.  \nII. THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IS \nWRONG AND REQUIRES CORRECTION.   \nIt is indisputable that this Court\u2019s definition of set-\ntlement in the context of public transactions and ac-\ncounts\u2014the \u201cadministrative determination of the \namount due\u201d on a claim,3 240 U.S. at 219\u2014must form \nthe basis of any test to determine whether a law pro-\nvides its own settlement mechanism. Nevertheless, \nboth prongs of the Federal Circuit\u2019s test\u2014that a stat-\nute must either (1) use \u201cspecific language\u201d that will \n\u201ctypically\u201d involve the term \u201csettle\u201d or (2) specifically \nset out a period of recovery, Pet.App.18a\u2014ignore and \nconflict with this Court\u2019s long-established definition of \nthe term \u201csettlement.\u201d That is improper. \nThe first prong is so formalistic as to make the sub-\nstance of this Court\u2019s definition irrelevant. A statute \nwithout the word \u201csettle\u201d or similar would fail that \nprong of the test even if it included all the necessary \nfeatures to allow an agency to make an \u201cadministra-\ntive determination of the amount due.\u201d See supra Sec-\ntion I.B. Conversely, a statute would pass that test \neven if the statute provided no detail whatsoever on \n\u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d Pet.App.7a, so \nlong as the word \u201csettle\u201d or similar appeared in its text. \nEither way, the substance of this Court\u2019s definition has \nno apparent role in the inquiry. \n \n3 The word \u201cclaim\u201d in this context also has a longstanding defini-\ntion. See Hobbs v. McLean, 117 U.S. 567, 575 (1886) (\u201cWhat is a \nclaim against the United States is well understood. It is a right to \ndemand money from the United States . . . which can be presented \nby the claimant to some department or officer of the United States \nfor payment, or may be prosecuted in the court[s].\u201d). \n\n16 \n \nThe second prong simply replaces this Court\u2019s defi-\nnition of settlement directly. The question of whether \na statute contains a limitations period has nothing to \ndo with whether it contains a procedure for adminis-\ntratively determining amounts due. While a limita-\ntions period could reduce the total due for payment \nthat results from executing such a procedure, it is \nmerely an input into the calculation\u2014not the proce-\ndure itself. The Federal Circuit offers nothing to sup-\nport that a limitations period must be included for stat-\nute to confer settlement authority, or that this prong \nof its test is in any way derivable from this Court\u2019s def-\ninition of settlement.   \nA test that does derive from this Court\u2019s definition of \nsettlement would directly account for a statute\u2019s sub-\nstance, asking whether its provisions allow for an ad-\nministrative determination of the amount due on a de-\nmand for payment. And where a statute establishes \nhow to determine the amount of a monthly payment \ndue, the maximum amount payable, who is eligible, \nthe status of the payments, who can prescribe applica-\ntion procedures, and the source of the relevant pay-\nments\u2014as 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413a indisputably does\u2014that \ntest is satisfied.  \nThis Court should grant the petition to decide as \nmuch, and to correct the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision to \nthe contrary.  \nIII. THIS CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE FOR RE-\nSOLVING THE QUESTION PRESENTED, \nAND NO FURTHER PERCOLATION IS POS-\nSIBLE.  \nThis case neatly presents a purely legal issue regard-\ning statutory interpretation and fidelity to this Court\u2019s \nprecedent. There are no facts in dispute. The proper \ntest for determining whether the Barring Act governs \n\n17 \n \nsettlement was the core focus of the Federal Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, and that issue was specifically decided in a \nprecedential opinion that was outcome-determinative \nfor the parties. The case involves no procedural com-\nplications, and is representative of how the issue \nwould arise in the context of demands for payment un-\nder other statutes. \nMoreover, no further percolation of this issue is pos-\nsible. The Federal Circuit enjoys exclusive appellate \njurisdiction over cases involving demands for payment \nfrom the federal government, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1491, \n1346(a), 1295(a)(2), (a)(3) (explaining that Tucker Act \nand \u201cLittle\u201d Tucker Act authorize demands for pay-\nment totaling less or more than $10,000 respectively, \nand noting Federal Circuit\u2019s exclusive appellate juris-\ndiction in either case), as well as over veterans\u2019 mat-\nters, see 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. The split panel decision, and \nthe decision not to review en banc, are the final word \non whether deserving veterans receive the benefits \nthat they are rightfully due\u2014unless this Court inter-\nvenes.  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari. \n \n \n \n \n   Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \nBARTON F.

United States*.\n\nThis initial analysis has established the foundational legal conflict at the heart of the case. I now understand that the core task is to predict how the Supreme Court will resolve a statutory conflict between two federal laws: the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the Barring Act.\n\nMy understanding of the key task parameters (\u03b8) has evolved from zero to a structured framework:\n\n*   **Central Legal Question:** The case hinges on which statute's rules govern the calculation of retroactive CRSC payments. The CRSC statute has its own procedural rules, while the Barring Act imposes a general six-year limitation on claims against the government.\n*   **Competing Arguments & Canons of Interpretation:**\n    *   **Petitioner's Likely Argument (Soto):** The CRSC statute is more specific to this type of compensation and should therefore supersede the more general Barring Act (the *specific-governs-general* canon). Any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the veterans under the *pro-veteran canon*.\n    *   **Respondent's Likely Argument (United States):** The Barring Act is a condition on the government's waiver of sovereign immunity. Such waivers must be construed narrowly in favor of the government. Therefore, its six-year limit on claims applies unless explicitly overridden by the CRSC statute.\n*   **Lower Court Context:** The petitioner (Soto) was successful at the district court level, which applied the specific-governs-general and pro-veteran canons. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed this decision, suggesting it likely gave more weight to the sovereign immunity/Barring Act argument. This split provides the Supreme Court with two distinct legal rationales to evaluate.\n\nMy belief is no longer a blank slate. I now have a clear model of the legal dispute, the key statutes in play, and the competing interpretive principles that the Supreme Court will need to weigh. My predictive task is now focused on determining which of these canons the current Court is more likely to favor in this specific context.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My prior beliefs established the foundational conflict between the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the Barring Act, identifying the competing interpretive canons at play: the petitioner's reliance on the *specific-governs-general* and *pro-veteran* canons versus the government's likely reliance on the narrow construction of waivers of sovereign immunity. I understood the case as a choice between these competing principles, with the lower court split providing two distinct rationales for the Supreme Court to consider.\n\nThe observation of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has significantly refined and deepened this understanding. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) have evolved in the following ways:\n\n*   **Refined Central Legal Question:** My understanding of the core legal question has become more precise. The petitioner is not merely asking *which statute applies*, but is framing the issue for the Court as: **What is the correct *test* to determine if a statute provides its own \"settlement\" procedure that displaces the Barring Act's default rules?** This strategic framing elevates the case from a one-off statutory dispute to a question of administrative law with broad implications, which may be more attractive for Supreme Court review.\n\n*   **Identification of Key Precedent:** The petition identifies what will likely be the cornerstone precedent for the petitioner's argument: ***Illinois Surety Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Peeler*** **(1916)**. This case defines \"settlement\" as \"an administrative determination of the amount due.\" This is a critical piece of evidence. My predictive task is no longer just about abstract canons but about how the current Court will interpret and apply this specific, century-old precedent.\n\n*   **Clarification of Petitioner's Legal Argument:** I now have a much clearer view of the petitioner's line of attack. They argue:\n    1.  The CRSC statute provides all the necessary components for an \"administrative determination of the amount due\" (eligibility, calculation formula, etc.).\n    2.  Therefore, under the functional definition from *Illinois Surety*, the CRSC statute *is* a \"settlement\" procedure.\n    3.  The Federal Circuit invented a \"novel\" and incorrect two-part test, requiring a statute to either use the magic word \"settle\" or provide its own limitations period. The petitioner argues this rigid test is not supported by precedent.\n\n*   **Anticipation of Respondent's Counter-Argument:** Based on the petitioner's framing, I can now better anticipate the government's counter-argument. The U.S. will likely argue that the Federal Circuit's test is a necessary and proper way to enforce the canon that waivers of sovereign immunity (like the Barring Act) must be construed narrowly and that congressional intent to override the Barring Act's six-year limit must be unmistakably clear. They will argue that simply providing a payment calculation formula is not a clear enough statement from Congress to displace the specific time limit on claims against the Treasury.\n\n*   **Significance of the Lower Court Dissent:** The petition highlights that the Federal Circuit's decision was a split one, with Judge Reyna dissenting. The dissent argued that the majority created \"new requirements\" and that the CRSC statute does, in fact, provide for the settlement of claims. The existence of a well-reasoned dissent provides the Supreme Court with a ready-made alternative legal framework, which can increase the likelihood of both granting certiorari and reversing the majority opinion. This is a significant signal that the legal issue is contentious and subject to reasonable disagreement among federal judges.\n\n*   **Addition of a Structural Argument:** The petitioner is also making a structural argument that the Federal Circuit's new test will disrupt established agency practice across other benefits statutes. This \"parade of horribles\" argument\u2014that the ruling creates uncertainty for how the government settles many other types of debts\u2014is a pragmatic consideration that can appeal to the Court.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has moved from a general understanding of a statutory conflict to a detailed model of a specific legal dispute centered on the interpretation of the term \"settlement\" as defined in *Illinois Surety*. I now understand the petitioner's precise legal strategy, the key precedent they will use, the significance of the judicial dissent below, and the broader administrative law implications they will raise. My predictive task is now focused on how the current Supreme Court will weigh the functional definition of \"settlement\" from *Illinois Surety* against the strong presumption of sovereign immunity and the need for clear statutory statements to override the Barring Act.",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this context, the term \u201csettle\u201d means to make \na final administrative determination regarding the gov-\nernment\u2019s total liability on a claim.  See Illinois Sur. Co. \nv. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  The Barring \nAct specifies which officials are authorized to settle the \naccounts of federal employees and when such claims \nmust be presented.  As relevant here, the Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle all claims \u201cinvolving \nuniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, re-\ntired pay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  \nThat authority is subject to a six-year time limit for sub-\nmitting claims, 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1), which the Secre-\ntary may waive for claims that do not exceed $25,000,  \n31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \nAt issue in this case are claims for allegedly unpaid \ncombat-related special compensation (CRSC), which is \na compensation available only to retired uniformed ser-\nvice members with combat-related disabilities who elect \nbenefits under 10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).  \nThe Department of Defense has exercised its authority \nunder the Barring Act to settle petitioner\u2019s claims for \nretroactive payment of CRSC, subject to a six-year pay-\nment cap in light of the Barring Act\u2019s claim-submission \ndeadline.  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether 10 U.S.C. 1413a displaces the settlement \nprocedures and limitations set forth in the Barring Act.   \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 8 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nJoseph M.

SOTO, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON BEHALF OF ALL \nOTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES IN OPPOSITION \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-19a) \nis reported at 92 F.4th 1094.  The order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 32a-37a) is available at 2021 WL \n7286022.  A prior order of the district court (Pet. App. \n21a-31a) is unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 20a) \nwas entered on February 12, 2024.  A petition for re-\nhearing was denied on June 20, 2024 (Pet. App. 40a-\n41a).  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nSeptember 18, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1).  \nSTATEMENT \n1. The Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. 3702, provides a com-\nprehensive remedy for the settlement of claims \u201cof or \n\n2 \n \nagainst the United States\u201d except where that law is su-\nperseded by another, more specific claims-settlement \nstatute.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a); see 3 Office of the Gen. \nCounsel, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office (GAO), GAO-08-\n978SP, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 14-\n23 to 14-28 (3d ed., rev. vol. 2016) (GAO Red Book).  The \nterm \u201csettle\u201d in this context means to make a final ad-\nministrative determination regarding the government\u2019s \ntotal liability on a claim\u2014that is, to determine the spe-\ncific amount owed to an individual under the terms of \nfederal contracts or statutory provisions, including any \napplicable adjustments and offsets.  See Illinois Sur. \nCo. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214, 219 (1916).  As origi-\nnally enacted, the settlement authority conferred by the \nBarring Act \u201cwas not only comprehensive but exclu-\nsive,\u201d so that all claims and accounts concerning the \nUnited States would be \u201csettled and adjusted in the \nTreasury Department.\u201d  GAO Red Book 14-23 (quoting \nAct of Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 45, \u00a7 2, 3 Stat. 366).  Since then, \nCongress has enacted several amendments to this broad \ngrant of settlement authority.  Three of those amend-\nments are relevant here. \nFirst, Congress has amended the Barring Act to \ntransfer claims-settlement responsibility from the Treas-\nury Department to various other agencies, depending \non the nature of the claim involved.  See 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a)(1)-(4); see generally GAO Red Book 14-23 to 14-\n24 (detailing the history of such transfers).   \nSecond, Congress established a six-year deadline for \nthe submission of claims falling within the Barring Act\u2019s \nscope.  See GAO Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-604, \u00a7 801, \n88 Stat. 1965.  That amendment conformed the Barring \nAct \u201cto the 6-year limitation period applicable to judicial \nactions on claims against the United States under 28 \n\n3 \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401 and 2501,\u201d and the amendment\u2019s legisla-\ntive history \u201cnoted that \u2018[t]his will make the time limi-\ntation consistent with the Statute of Limitations now \napplicable to claims filed in administrative agencies and \nthe courts.\u2019\u200a\u201d  In re Joseph M. Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. 157, \n161 (1994) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1314, 93d Cong., 2d \nSess. 5-6 (1974)) (brackets in original).1  Agencies are \nnot permitted to waive or extend this six-year statute of \nlimitations except where a statute expressly authorizes \nthat step.  See GAO Red Book 14-28 to 14-29. \nThird, the Barring Act\u2019s administrative claims- \nsettlement authority is no longer exclusive.  Over the \nyears, Congress has enacted various laws that ex-\npressly authorize specific agencies to settle certain \nclaims that arise out of the agency\u2019s operations, and \nthose specific claims-settlement procedures supersede \nthe Barring Act\u2019s generally applicable provisions.  See \nGAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing statutes that per-\nmit agencies to settle claims administratively).  The \nBarring Act\u2019s directive regarding who has final author-\nity to settle claims of or against the United States, and \nwhen those claims must be presented, are thus provi-\nsions of general applicability that govern \u201c[e]xcept as \nprovided in this chapter or another law.\u201d  31 U.S.C. \n3702(a). \nAs relevant here, the Barring Act vests in the Secre-\ntary of Defense the authority to settle all claims \u201cinvolv-\ning uniformed service members\u2019 pay, allowances, travel, \ntransportation, payments for unused accrued leave, retired \npay, and survivor benefits.\u201d  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).2  \n \n1  Before the 1974 amendment, the Barring Act\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions was ten years.  See Ford, 73 Comp. Gen. at 161. \n2  See 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(2) (similarly delegating to the Office of \nPersonnel Management the authority to settle claims involving  \n\n4 \n \nSuch claims must be presented \u201cwithin 6 years after the \nclaim accrues,\u201d however, subject to enumerated excep-\ntions.  31 U.S.C. 3702(b)(1).  The Secretary of Defense \ncan waive the statute of limitations for claims involving \nservice members\u2019 compensation that do not exceed \n$25,000.  31 U.S.C. 3702(e)(1) and (3). \n2. The dispute in this case concerns whether the \nBarring Act\u2019s statute of limitations applies to claims for \nunpaid \u201ccombat-related special compensation\u201d (CRSC).  \nGenerally speaking, retired members of the uniformed \nservices who are entitled to both military retired pay \nfrom the Department of Defense and disability compen-\nsation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nmay not lawfully receive the full amount of both their \nretired pay and their disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. \n5304, 5305.  Instead, retired service members who wish \nto receive disability compensation are generally re-\nquired to waive a portion of their military retired pay in \nan amount equal to the amount of disability compensa-\ntion they receive.  38 U.S.C. 5305; but see 10 U.S.C. \n1414.  Retired service members who can establish that \ntheir compensable disability is directly attributable to a \n\u201ccombat-related\u201d event, however, can receive additional \ncompensation up to the amount of their waived retired \npay.  10 U.S.C. 1413a (2018 & Supp. IV 2022).   \nOriginally, this substantive entitlement to CRSC \nwas payable only to individuals who had completed at \nleast 20 years of military service.  See 10 U.S.C. 1413a \n(2006).  But effective January 1, 2008, retirees with \nfewer than 20 years of military service are eligible for \nCRSC if they were medically retired under 10 U.S.C. \n \nfederal civilian employees\u2019 compensation); 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(4) \n(providing that the Office of Management and Budget has the au-\nthority to settle all claims not delegated elsewhere). \n\n5 \n \n1201-1222.  National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-\ncal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, Div. A, Tit. VI, \u00a7 641, \n122 Stat. 156; 10 U.S.C. 1413a(b)(3)(B).   \nThe statute that authorizes CRSC, 10 U.S.C. 1413a, \nstates that \u201c[t]he Secretary concerned shall pay to each \neligible combat-related disabled uniformed services re-\ntiree who elects benefits under this section a monthly \namount for the combat-related disability of the retiree.\u201d  \n10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).  Section 1413a further provides that \nthe Secretary of Defense \u201cshall prescribe procedures \nand criteria under which a disabled uniformed services \nretiree may apply\u201d to be considered \u201can eligible combat-\nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree\u201d and elect \nbenefits.  10 U.S.C. 1413a(d).   \nThose procedures, which are set forth in various reg-\nulations and program guidance, specify that a retired \nservice member must first elect to receive CRSC.   See \n7B U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def., DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Man-\nagement Regulation, Ch. 63, at 63-5 to 63-6 (June 2024).  \nThe appropriate military department will then deter-\nmine whether the service member is eligible, which gen-\nerally requires being in retired status and having a ser-\nvice-connected disability that is rated by the VA as at \nleast 10% disabling.  See id. at 63-6 to 63-9, 63-19.  The \nmilitary department will also determine whether one or \nmore of the applicant\u2019s disabilities are directly attribut-\nable to a combat-related event.  See id. at 63-19.  If \nthose criteria are satisfied, the service member will be \nfound eligible for CRSC, and his or her application will \nbe forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService for payment.  See ibid.  \n3. a. Petitioner Simon Soto is a retired member of \nthe United States Marine Corps with a combat-related \ndisability rated at least 10% disabling.  Pet. App. 4a.  In \n\n6 \n \nApril 2006 petitioner was medically retired from active \nduty with less than 20 years of military service.  Ibid.  \nAlthough he met the eligibility criteria for CRSC as of \nJune 2009\u2014when he received his disability rating from \nthe VA\u2014he did not apply and elect to receive CRSC un-\ntil seven years later, in June 2016.  Ibid.   \nIn October 2016, the Navy determined that peti-\ntioner\u2019s disability was combat-related and that he was \nentitled to CRSC payments for the months following his \nJune 2016 application and election.  Pet. App. 22a.  The \nNavy also informed petitioner that, even for the period \nbefore June 2016, petitioner could receive retroactive \nCRSC payments for months in which he met the eligi-\nbility criteria, but that those payments would be limited \nby the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nIbid.  Petitioner did not request a waiver pursuant to 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(e)(1) of the six-year time limit.  Pet. App. \n4a.  As a result, petitioner received six years of retroac-\ntive CRSC payments covering the period from July \n2010 to June 2016.  Ibid. \nb. In March 2017, petitioner filed a class-action suit \nin the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas under 28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) (the Little \nTucker Act), contending that the Barring Act\u2019s six-year \nstatute of limitations does not apply to claims for CRSC.  \nPet. App. 4a.  Petitioner further argued that no other \nlimitations period was applicable and that he was there-\nfore entitled to retroactive payments dating back to \nJanuary 1, 2008\u2014the effective date of the statute in \nwhich Congress expanded CRSC eligibility, see p. 4,  \nsupra\u2014rather than July 2010.  Pet. App. 4a.   \nThe government moved for judgment on the plead-\nings.  The district court denied the motion, holding that \nthe CRSC-authorization statute, Section 1413a, is a \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecific\u201d statute that supersedes the generally applica-\nble terms of the Barring Act.  D. Ct. Doc. 39, at 5 (Aug. \n31, 2017) (citation omitted).  The court subsequently \ncertified a class of all \u201c[f]ormer service members of the \nUnited States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or \nCoast Guard  * * *  whose amount of CRSC payment \nwas limited by\u201d the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of \nlimitations and who have \u201cclaim[s] of less than $10,000.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a; see id. at 21a-31a.  The court then \ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs, reiterat-\ning its prior view that Section 1413a contains its own \n\u201csettlement mechanism.\u201d  Id. at 35a; see id. at 32a-37a.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court stated that Sec-\ntion 1413a \u201cdefines eligibility for CRSC, helps explain \nthe amount of benefits and instructs the Secretary of \nDefense to prescribe procedures and criteria for indi-\nviduals to apply for CRSC.\u201d  Id. at 35a-36a. \nc. The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.    \nThe court explained that Section 1413a establishes \u201cwho \nmay be eligible for CRSC payments,\u201d not how claimants \ncan have claims for unpaid compensation determined \nand settled.  Id. at 7a.  The court observed that\u2014unlike \nother statutes that displace the Barring Act\u2014Section \n1413a does not contain \u201cspecific language authorizing \nthe Secretary of Defense to settle a claim\u201d for unpaid \ncompensation,\u201d which the court noted \u201cwill typically be \ndone by use of the term \u2018settle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 6a-7a.  \nThe court further observed that Section 1413a does not \ncontain a \u201c\u200a\u2018specific\u2019 provision setting out the period of \nrecovery.\u201d  Id. at 7a.  Having determined that \u201c[t]he \nCRSC statute lacks the sort of clear language authoriz-\ning the Secretary to settle CRSC claims sufficient for \nan exception to the Barring Act,\u201d the court of appeals \nheld that Section 1413a does not displace the Act\u2019s \n\n8 \n \ngenerally applicable claims-settlement procedures, in-\ncluding its six-year statute of limitations.  Id. at 8a. \nJudge Reyna dissented.  He would have held that \nSection 1413a displaces the Barring Act because Sec-\ntion 1413a defines which retirees are eligible for CRSC \npayments and specifies the monthly amount that shall \nbe paid to those retirees.  Pet. App. 12a-19a. \nARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals held that the Secretary of De-\nfense\u2019s authority to settle claims for unpaid amounts of \nCRSC\u2014like the Secretary\u2019s authority to settle claims \nfor other forms of military pay and benefits\u2014is subject \nto the Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  \nThat decision is correct and does not conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or of another court of appeals.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \n1. Petitioner contends (Pet. 15-16) that 10 U.S.C. \n1413a (which authorizes the payment of CRSC) is \u201can-\nother law\u201d that displaces the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. \n3702(a), and that the Secretary therefore may settle \nclaims for unpaid retroactive CRSC without regard to \nthe Barring Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.  The \ncourt of appeals correctly rejected that argument.  \nNothing in the text of Section 1413a or any other provi-\nsion of law supersedes the six-year limit that the Bar-\nring Act imposes on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s author-\nity to settle claims for unpaid military compensation.   \nWhen Congress has elected to displace the Barring \nAct\u2019s generally applicable settlement procedures or the \nAct\u2019s statute of limitations, it has done so expressly.  \nSee Pet. App. 6a-7a.  Under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct, 28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq., for example, the authority to \nadministratively \u201csettle\u201d a tort claim belongs to the \nagency from whose operations the claim arose, subject \n\n9 \n \nto a two-year statute of limitations.  28 U.S.C. 2672; see \n28 U.S.C. 2401(b); see also 10 U.S.C. 2733 (2018 & Supp. \nIV 2022) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to \u201cset-\ntle\u201d certain tort claims arising under the Military \nClaims Act, 10 U.S.C. 2731 et seq., subject to a two-year \nstatute of limitations); 39 U.S.C. 401(8) (authorizing the \nUnited States Postal Service to \u201csettle\u201d claims that \narise out of its operations).  Such express grants of set-\ntlement authority and specific limitations periods ren-\nder the Barring Act\u2019s conflicting provisions inapplica-\nble.  See GAO Red Book 14-21 to 14-23 (listing other \nstatutes). \nBy contrast, the statute that authorizes CRSC \u201ccon-\nveys no [settlement] authority.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a.  That \nstatute defines which individuals are eligible to elect \nCRSC payments, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a), (c), and (e), and \nspecifies the monthly amount they may receive, 10 \nU.S.C. 1413a(b).  But the statute contains no language \nthat is naturally understood to create an administrative \nprocess to settle claims for unpaid amounts, or any pro-\nvision that otherwise conflicts with the Barring Act\u2019s \nconferral of settlement authority or its six-year statute \nof limitations.  The statute does not, for example, spec-\nify when claims for unpaid CRSC must be submitted or \nwho is authorized to make a final determination regard-\ning the total amount for which the United States is lia-\nble.  Indeed, the words \u201csettle\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d do not ap-\npear in Section 1413a.     \nPetitioner nevertheless argues (Pet. 16) that Section \n1413a conveys freestanding settlement authority.  Peti-\ntioner draws that inference from the statutory provi-\nsions that require the Secretary to create procedures \nand criteria to determine whether a disabled uniformed \nservices retiree is \u201cconsidered to be an eligible combat-\n\n10 \n \nrelated disabled uniformed services retiree,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \n1413a(d), and that direct the Secretary to make a spe-\ncific type of monthly payment to eligible individuals who \nelect that benefit, 10 U.S.C. 1413a(a).3  But those provi-\nsions \u201cestablish a veteran\u2019s substantive right to CRSC \nand authorize its payment,\u201d Pet. App. 8a; they do not \naddress \u201chow eligible claims may be settled,\u201d id. at 7a \n(emphasis added).  As with other forms of military com-\npensation, the Secretary\u2019s authority to make a final ad-\nministrative determination about the government\u2019s to-\ntal liability to individuals who submit claims for unpaid \namounts of CRSC arises out of the Barring Act, subject \nto that law\u2019s terms and limitations.  See GAO Red Book \n14-26 (explaining that the Barring Act provides \u201cthe \nprocedural authority to settle claims administratively\u201d \nwhenever the \u201csubstantive criteria upon which\u201d the \nclaim is based are specified by another provision of law).  \nPetitioner\u2019s view that Section 1413a implicitly in-\ncludes its own settlement mechanism for unpaid claims \nwould render Section 3702(a)(1)(A)\u2014the Barring Act \nprovision that grants the Secretary of Defense settle-\nment authority over \u201cclaims involving\u201d specific kinds of \n\u201cuniformed service members\u2019 pay\u201d and other benefits\u2014\na virtual nullity.  31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A).  Because Sec-\ntion 3702(a)(1)(A) does not itself establish substantive \ncriteria for determining whether particular service \nmembers are entitled to payment, every form of mili-\ntary \u201cpay, allowances, travel, transportation, payments \n \n3 Petitioner also notes (Pet. 16) that 10 U.S.C. 1413a(h) (Supp. IV \n2022) identifies the appropriated funds that may be used to pay \nCRSC.  But he does not explain why this specification of the source \nof funding would displace the Barring Act\u2019s settlement mechanisms \nand corresponding six-year statute of limitations for claims involv-\ning unpaid amounts.    \n\n11 \n \nfor unused accrued leave, retired pay, and survivor ben-\nefits,\u201d 31 U.S.C. 3702(a)(1)(A), depends on other statu-\ntory provisions that, like Section 1413a, specify who is \neligible for compensation and in what amount.  See, e.g., \n10 U.S.C. 1401, 12731, and 12739 (2018 & Supp. IV 2022) \n(retired pay); 10 U.S.C.1448, 1451 (2018 & Supp. IV \n2022) (survivor annuities); 37 U.S.C. 204 (basic pay); 37 \nU.S.C. 302-308 (special pay).  If these commonplace fea-\ntures of statutes that establish substantive rights to \npayment displaced the Barring Act\u2019s settlement proce-\ndures, those procedures would almost never apply to \nclaims involving unpaid amounts of military compensa-\ntion.   \nThe Barring Act\u2019s statute of limitations was origi-\nnally enacted to address the recognized problem of stale \nclaims submitted by veterans and federal employees \nseeking back pay or allowances \u201cnot infrequently from \n10 to 25 years after the rights of the claimants arose,\u201d \nand occasionally \u201c50 to 100 years after they first ac-\ncrued.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1338, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940).  \nReports accompanying the legislation noted the signifi-\ncant costs associated with evaluating such stale claims, \nmost of which lacked merit.  See id. at 2-3; H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1541, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 2 (1940) (1940 House Re-\nport).  Because the attendant effort was \u201cso great as to \nmake it prejudicial to the interests of the United \nStates,\u201d 1940 House Report 2, Congress has barred con-\nsideration of claims that are not timely submitted, un-\nless an exception applies or a statute provides other-\nwise.  But under petitioner\u2019s view that the CRSC stat-\nute contains its own settlement mechanism but no tem-\nporal limit on claims, disabled uniform service retirees \nwho believe that the Department of Defense has miscal-\nculated or missed a prior CRSC payment could wait \n\n12 \n \nindefinitely before alerting the Department to its pur-\nported error.  Petitioner identifies no basis for distin-\nguishing the CRSC statute from the provisions that \ngovern other forms of military compensation, or for rec-\nonciling his view of the law with Congress\u2019s intent in en-\nacting the Barring Act.   \n2. The question presented does not meet this Court\u2019s \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10. \na. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization (Pet. 15-\n16), the court of appeals\u2019 decision is fully consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csettlement\u201d in \nIllinois Surety Co. v. United States, 240 U.S. 214 (1916).  \nSee id. at 219 (defining \u201csettlement\u201d to mean \u201cadminis-\ntrative determination of the amount due\u201d).  The court of \nappeals here acknowledged that, in the context of public \ntransactions and accounts, the term \u201csettlement\u201d refers \nto the authority to \u201c\u200a\u2018administratively determine the va-\nlidity of [a] claim\u2019\u200a\u201d and make a final determination of \nthe amount of the government\u2019s liability to the claimant.  \nPet. App. 3a n.1 (citation omitted). \nApplying that definition and using ordinary tools of \nstatutory construction, the court of appeals concluded \nthat, while Section 1413a directs the Secretary of De-\nfense to pay CRSC to eligible individuals who elect that \nbenefit, it \u201cdo[es] not authorize the Secretary to \u2018admin-\nistratively determine the validity\u2019 of a claim\u201d for unpaid \nfunds.  Pet. App. 8a (citation omitted).  To the extent \nthat Illinois Surety is relevant here, it supports the dis-\ntinction the panel drew between those two concepts.  \nThe Illinois Surety Court observed that the \u201cpivotal \nwords\u201d in the statute at issue were \u201cnot \u2018final payment,\u2019 \nbut \u2018final settlement\u2019 and in view of the significance of \nthe latter term in administrative practice, it is hardly \nlikely that it would have been used had it been intended \n\n13 \n \nto denote payment.\u201d  240 U.S. at 218-219; see Pet. App. \n7a.  The court of appeals\u2019 determination\u2014which was \nbased on the specific language of Section 1413a, a pro-\nvision that was not at issue in Illinois Surety\u2014does not \nconflict with the holding or reasoning of that decision.   \nb.  The decision below also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Cf. Pet. 17.  Peti-\ntioner argues (Pet. 12-15) that this Court\u2019s review is \nwarranted because the court of appeals\u2019 analysis may \nrequire agencies to reassess other statutory delegations \nof claims-settlement authority.  But petitioner\u2019s specu-\nlation that agencies will have to reconsider prior deci-\nsions involving unrelated statutes is unfounded.  In-\ndeed, although petitioner contends that the decision be-\nlow will cause a \u201csea change\u201d (Pet. 13), he identifies only \ntwo agency decisions that he believes are inconsistent \nwith it.  Nothing in those decisions is inconsistent with \nthe court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Section 1413a.   \n Petitioner first relies (Pet. 13) upon the decision of \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in Lee v. \nDepartment of Justice, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), in which \nthe MSPB held that it has authority to order back pay \nas compensation for violations of the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \n1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  The MSPB \nreached that conclusion based on USERRA\u2019s language \n\u201cspecifically authoriz[ing]\u201d the MSPB \u201cto order com-\npensation for \u2018any loss of wages or benefits\u2019 resulting \nfrom any USERRA violation that occurred on or after\u201d \nUSERRA\u2019s effective date.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265 \n(quoting 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)).  The MSPB further con-\ncluded that this express authority to award back pay \nwas not limited by either the Barring Act or the six-year \nlimitation on recovery in the Back Pay Act of 1966,  \n\n14 \n \n5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(4), because the MSPB has \u201cexclusive\u201d \njurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c) to adjudicate \nUSERRA claims without regard to when a particular \nclaim accrued.  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 265; see id. at 265-\n266, 268; see also Hernandez v. Department of the Air \nForce, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331 & n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (stat-\ning that USERRA claims are \u201cgoverned exclusively\u201d by \nUSERRA\u2019s specific directive that the MSPB may adju-\ndicate such claims \u201c\u200a\u2018without regard as to\u2019\u200a\u201d whether \nthey accrued before or after USERRA\u2019s effective date) \n(citation omitted).  But as the court of appeals here rec-\nognized, Section 1413a contains no equivalent back pay, \njurisdictional, or timing provisions.  See Pet. App. 7a.4 \nThe court of appeals\u2019 analysis is also fully consistent \nwith the assessment of the Office of Personnel Manage-\nment (OPM) of the claim in File No. S001855.2, 1999 \nOPM Dec. LEXIS 338 (June 16, 1999) (see Pet. 13).  In \nthat instance, an individual who had previously been \nemployed as a police officer at an unnamed agency filed \na claim with OPM challenging the lawfulness of the ex-\npiration of his temporary appointment.  Id. at *1.  OPM \ndismissed that claim for lack of jurisdiction, noting that \nchallenges to the lawfulness of a separation under the \nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 must be presented to \nthe employing agency, subject to appeal before the \nMSPB.  Id. at *2 (citing 5 U.S.C. 7513).  In other words, \na separate statute dictated a process for resolving a \n \n4 Petitioner contends (Pet. 13 n.2) that he relies on Lee only for \nthat decision\u2019s discussion of the Back Pay Act.  His point is unclear.  \nIn the portion of Lee that petitioner cites, the MSPB assessed its \nremedial authority under USERRA.  See 99 M.S.P.R. at 265.  The \nMSPB then held that the Back Pay Act, with its attendant \u201c6-year \nlimitation on recovery,\u201d also \u201cdoes not control the remedy in a \nUSERRA case.\u201d  Lee, 99 M.S.P.R. at 268-269.   \n\n15 \n \nparticular kind of claim, and OPM concluded that this \nconflicting provision displaced OPM\u2019s authority to ren-\nder a final determination under the Barring Act, 31 \nU.S.C. 3702(a).  But petitioner identifies no comparable \nlanguage in Section 1413a.   \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 13-14) on 10 U.S.C. 7712 is \nsimilarly unavailing.  Petitioner identifies no judicial or \nagency decision supporting his view that this statute\u2014\nwhich generally addresses how to treat proceeds of the \neffects of persons who die in locations under Army  \njurisdiction\u2014gives the Department of Defense free-\nstanding settlement authority apart from the Barring \nAct.  Like Section 1413a, Section 7712 does not ex-\npressly confer authority to \u201csettle\u201d and does not refer-\nence \u201cclaims\u201d of any kind. \nPetitioner notes (Pet. 13) that a prior version of the \nstatute directed the Army to \u201cmake a full report of the \ntransactions under this section  * * *  for transmission \nto the General Accounting Office for action authorized \nin the settlement of accounts of deceased members of \nthe Army.\u201d  10 U.S.C. 4712(g) (1994).  But that merely \nreflects the fact that the Comptroller General of the \nGAO previously had authority to settle all claims \nagainst the United States, including the authority to \nsettle the final accounts of deceased military personnel.  \nSee 31 U.S.C. 3702(a) (1994); GAO Red Book 14-23 (ex-\nplaining that the Barring Act\u2019s claims-settlement func-\ntion was transferred from the Treasury Department to \nthe GAO in 1921); see also 10 U.S.C. 2771(a) (designat-\ning the individuals who shall be paid as part of the \u201cset-\ntlement\u201d of the accounts of deceased service members).  \nCongress struck that subsection after it transferred the \nGAO\u2019s settlement functions to the Office of Manage-\nment and Budget (OMB).  See Legislative Branch \n\n16 \n \nAppropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-53, Tit. II,  \n\u00a7 211(a) and (b), 109 Stat. 535; GAO Act of 1996, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-316, \u00a7 202(g), 110 Stat. 3842.   \nIn any event, OMB has delegated to the Department \nof Defense the authority to settle the final accounts of \ndeceased service members.  See OMB, Determination \nwith Respect to Transfer of Functions Pursuant to \nPublic Law 104-53, Attach. A (June 28, 1996); see also \nIn re Transfer of Claims Settlement and Related Ad-\nvance Decisions, Waivers, and Other Functions, 97-1 \nComp. Gen. Proc. Dec. P123, 1997 U.S. Comp. Gen. \nLexis 300, at *9 (Mar. 17, 1997).  There is accordingly \nno doubt that the Department of Defense has authority \nto settle claims involving such accounts, subject to a six-\nyear statute of limitations.  See 32 C.F.R. Pt. 282, App. \nC, Subsec. (f)(1)(ii) (\u201cClaims under 31 U.S.C. 3702(b), 10 \nU.S.C. 2771 and 32 U.S.C. 714 must be received within \n6 years of the date the claim accrued.\u201d).  Petitioner iden-\ntifies nothing in those established procedures that will \nneed to be revisited in light of the court of appeals\u2019 anal-\nysis of Section 1413a.  \nc. Finally, petitioner significantly overstates (Pet. \n10-12) the practical effects of the decision below.  As the \ncourt of appeals noted, \u201cveterans will receive the bene-\nfits they are owed unless [the benefits] accrued outside \nof the Barring Act\u2019s six-year period of recovery.\u201d  92 \nF.4th 1094, 1101 n.4.5  And even for those retired service \nmembers whose claims for payment fall outside the lim-\nitations period, the Barring Act permits the Secretary \nto waive the time limitation for claims that do not ex-\nceed $25,000 if the service member requests such a \nwaiver.  Ibid. (citing 31 U.S.C. 3702(e)); see 32 C.F.R. \n \n5  The petition appendix omits this portion of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision.  \n\n17 \n \nPt. 282, App. D, Subsec. (d) (setting forth the process \nfor requesting a waiver).  All of the class members here \nare eligible for waivers under that provision, since the Little \nTucker Act\u2019s amount-in-controversy limit, see 28 U.S.C. \n1346(a)(2), restricts the class to persons with claims for less \nthan $10,000.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior beliefs established the foundational conflict between the Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) statute and the Barring Act, centered on competing interpretive canons. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari significantly deepened this understanding by revealing the petitioner's specific legal strategy. My beliefs now incorporate the following key parameters (\u03b8):\n\n*   **The Central Question's Framing:** The case is not just about which statute applies, but about the correct *test* to determine if a benefits statute provides its own \"settlement\" procedure that displaces the Barring Act's default six-year limit.\n*   **Pivotal Precedent:** The petitioner's argument hinges on *Illinois Surety Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Peeler* (1916), which provides a functional definition of \"settlement\" as an \"administrative determination of the amount due.\"\n*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The petitioner contends the CRSC statute meets the *Illinois Surety* definition and that the Federal Circuit erred by inventing a new, more rigid two-part test (requiring the word \"settle\" or a separate limitations period).\n*   **Anticipated Government Counter:** The U.S. will likely defend the Federal Circuit's test as a necessary application of the canon that waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed narrowly, requiring a clear statement from Congress to override the Barring Act.\n*   **Supporting Signals:** The presence of a well-reasoned dissent in the Federal Circuit (from Judge Reyna) and the petitioner's structural argument about disrupting other agency settlement practices are significant factors that could influence the Supreme Court.\n\nThe latest observation, which is an internal reasoning step, does not introduce new external facts about the case. Instead, it critically refines my epistemic state by highlighting a significant imbalance in my knowledge. My beliefs have now been updated to explicitly recognize that my current, detailed model is based entirely on the petitioner's perspective.\n\nMy task-level beliefs (\u03b8) now formally include an awareness of this informational gap and a clear definition of the missing evidence required for a balanced prediction. To accurately forecast the Supreme Court's ruling, I must obtain and analyze the respondent's (the United States') counter-arguments, which are expected in the Brief in Opposition. The specific, missing task parameters I need to resolve are:\n\n1.  **The Government's Defense of the Federal Circuit's Test:** How does the Solicitor General justify the two-part test as a valid interpretive rule for the Barring Act's \"unless...otherwise provided for by law\" exception?\n2.  **The Government's Interpretation of *Illinois Surety*:** How does the government distinguish or narrow the scope of the *Illinois Surety* precedent? Why does it argue that the CRSC's administrative process for calculating payments does *not* qualify as a \"settlement\" under that case's definition?\n3.  **The Government's Hierarchy of Canons:** How does the government argue that the sovereign immunity canon should outweigh the pro-veteran canon in this specific context?\n4.  **The Government's Response to Structural Arguments:** How will the government rebut the petitioner's claim that the Federal Circuit's ruling will create widespread uncertainty and disrupt administrative practice for other benefits statutes?\n\nIn summary, my belief state has matured from having a detailed model of the petitioner's case to having a comprehensive map of the entire legal battlefield. I now understand not only the arguments that have been made but also the precise counter-arguments that must be understood to make a credible prediction. My predictive task is now contingent on observing the direct clash between the petitioner's known arguments and the government's forthcoming response on these specific points.",

The key insight that this \nlegal revolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question. Proponents claimed legitimacy for the theory on the \nground s that it was more faithful to legislative preferences than the then -prevailing \nappro aches. But the theory is based on the highly purposive approach to \ninterpreting statutes championed by the Legal Process School, whose methods \ndominated statutory interpretation around the time the theory was developed. Since \nthat time, statutory interpret ation has undergone a revolution of its own. The high \npurposivism of the Legal Process School has been mostly repudiated. Few would \nnow maintain, as Brainerd Currie (the father of governmental interest analysis) did, \nthat courts faced with statutory silenc e on a question should try to imagine how the \nlegislature would have resolved the question.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis in light of the \nrevolution that has occurred in the field of statutory interpretation since Currie \nelaborated his approach. We agree that choice of law can be understood as a matter \nof interpr eting forum law with respect to its applicability to multi -state cases. But, \ndrawing from the textualist critique of the high purposivism of the Legal Process \nera, we show that Currie -style governmental interest analysis cannot claim \nlegitimacy as more fai thful to legislative preferences than other possible interpretive \napproaches. Consistent with its general shift away from purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation, the U.S. Supreme Court has updated its approach to federal choice \nof law through the adoption  of a presumption against extraterritoriality.

That approach, \nknown as \u201cgovernmental interest  analysis,\u201d now appears to be facing the music. \nFederal courts have all but abandoned it, and while state courts continue to apply it, \nthey do so haphazardly, its persistence sitting  uncomfortably alongside  their \nembrace of non -purposivist methods of statutory interpretation. To the extent it \nsurvives, governmental interest analysis is a relic of a prior age, adrift in the current \njurisprudential environment. Current efforts by the American Law Institute  (\u201cALI\u201d)  \nto chart the future of choice of law reveal t hat legal commentators are forsaking \ngovernmental interest analysis in practice, even while professing fealty to its \ntheoretical foundations. It is now clear that whatever the merits or demerits of the \ntextualism that has largely replaced it, the broad rep udiation of a certain form of \npurposivism is leading to a fundamental reworking of American choice of law. This \nArticle describes and defends this development in U.S. choice of law.  \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United \nStates, largely displacing the approach that had previously prevailed here and that \nstill prevails in most of the rest of the world.2 The key insight that this legal \nrevolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question.3 As explained by Brainerd Currie, the theorist behind \n \n 1.

See Brainerd Currie , Notes on Methods and Objectives in the \nConflict of Laws , 1959 DUKE L.J.  171, 177\u201378 (1959) . \n394 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \ngovernmental interest analysis, the choice -of-law process \u201cis essentially the familiar \n[process] of construction or interpretation.\u201d4 If the legislature has addressed a law\u2019s \napplicability to cases having foreign elements, the court follows the legislature\u2019s \ndirection. But usually , a legislature enacts laws without addressing their multi -state \napplicability.5 Even in the face of legislative silence on this question, however, the \nquestion for Currie remained one of interpretation: \u201cJust as we determine by [the] \nprocess [of statutory interpretation] how a statute applies in time, and how it applies \nto marginal d omestic situations, so we may determine how it should be applied to \ncases involving foreign elements in order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d6 \nOn closer examination, it turns out that Currie\u2019s true innovation was not to \nregard choice of law as a matter of interpretation, but rather to bring a particular \napproach to interpretation  to bear on the question. The traditional choice -of-law \nrules already operated as substantive canons of interpretation, implicitly limiting the \nmulti -state applicability of forum law  in the absence of a contrary legislative \ninstruction.7 Currie\u2019s approach to interpretation differed. He adopted the approach \nthat prevailed at the time he was writing, leading him to interpret laws  as to their \nmulti -state applicability \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d8 Currie \n \n 4. Currie , supra note 3 , at 178.  \n 5. We use the term \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d to refer to a statute \u2019s applicability \nto cases having out -of-state elements \u2014such as a case that involves some out -of-state conduct \nor an out -of-state party.  We distinguish such cases from cases where all of the conduct took \nplace in the same state and all of the parties are from the state, which we refer to as the purely \ninternal case.  We use the term \u201cstate\u201d to include both states of the United States (New York, \nCalifornia) and states in the international sense (France, India).  \n  The draft Third Restatement  prefers to refer to a law \u2019s multi -state scope or \nreach . See infra  Section V.A; RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. B (AM. \nL. INST., Tentative Draft No. 3, 2023) . We avoid those terms to remain agnostic about the \ndraft Third Restatement \u2019s view that the relevant question (in the first step of the analysis it \nproposes) is the substantive scope or reach of the law.  An alternative way to understand the \nquestion is as relating to whether forum courts should apply  a given law to a multi -state case \neven if the law technically reaches the case as a substantive matter.  See Carlos M. V\u00e1zquez, \nNon-Extraterritoriality , 137 HARV. L. REV. 1290, 1347 \u201353 (2024).  This is the way the draft \nThird Restatement  understands the second step of the analysis, and we think the first step can \nbe understood this way as well.  See id. Currie himself appears to have understood the question \nat the first step in this sense.  See id.  at 1320 n.133.  For a discussion of the two ways of \nunderstanding the question, see infra  Section  V.B.  Because we do not take a position on this \nquestion here, we use the more inclusive term \u201cmulti -state applicability. \u201d \n 6. Currie, supra note 3, at 178.  \n 7. See infra  note 37 and accompanying text. Indeed, the idea  that choice of law \nis about statutory interpretation has ancient roots. See Hessell E. Yntema,  The Historic Bases \nof Private International Law , 2 AM. J. COMP AR. L. 297, 303 (1953) (\u201cThe  jurists in the \nmedieval Italian and French universities, who first elaborated conflicts law in  commentaries \non the lex Cunctos populos  (C. 1, 1, 1), and their successors in succeeding  centuries,  \ncommonly assumed that the solution of conflicts of laws was essentially a matter  of statutory \ninterpretation, of classifying statutes as real or personal with respect to  their spheres of \napplication.\u201d).  \n 8. See supra  text accompanying note 6. This idea goes back centuries as well.  \nSee Friedrich K. Juenger, A Page of History , 35 MERCER L. REV. 419, 433 (1984) (quoting \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  395 \nrejected one approach to statutory interpretation, under which a statute that is silent \nregarding multi -state applicability  would be interpreted in the light of traditional \nchoice -of-law rules, and replaced it with the highly purposivist approach to statutory \ninterpretation of the Legal Process School. In his words, a court  engaging in a \nchoice -of-law analysis  should \u201ctr[y] to decide [the question] as it believes [the \nlegislature] would have decided [it] had it foreseen the problem.\u201d9 According to \nCurrie, the purpose behind a given common -law rule or statute would tell us  whether \nthe enacting state had an interest in having the law applied, which would in turn lead \nto a determination about which state\u2019s law should be applied to a given case.10 This \napproach has become known as the \u201cgovernmental interest analysis\u201d approach to \nchoice of law.11 \nSince Currie\u2019s time, however, statutory -interpretation theory  has \nundergone  a revolution  of its own .12 In particular, the Supreme Court has forcefully \nchallenged approaches to statutory interpretation that ask how a legislature \u201cwould \nhave decided\u201d a question under an enacted statute. The Court has disdained the \npurposivism of the Legal Process School and embraced a far more textualist \napproach. This statutory -interpretation revolution has influenced the Court\u2019s \napproach when determining the applicability of federal statutes to cases having \nforeign elements. Expressly disavowing an approach that s eeks to \u201cdivin[e] what \nCongress would have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the court,\u201d13 \nthe Court has adopted a \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d14 Like Currie, the \nSupreme C ourt regard s the issue as one of interpreting the substantive statute in \nquestion, but unlike Currie, it presume s that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear \nindication of an extraterri torial application, it has none.\u201d15 Focusing largely, if not \nexclusively, on the statute\u2019s text, federal courts now interpret federal statutes to \napply only domestically unless Congress has affirmatively addressed the question \nof the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability .16 \n \nGuy de Coquille, who argued in the sixteenth century that the distinction between real and \npersonal laws should not depend \u201con the mere shell of words, but on . . . the presumed and \napparent purpose of those who have enacted the statute or custom.\u201d (quotin g 1 A.

For their part, the states have largely followed their \nfederal brethren in rejecting high purposivism  in statutory interpretation . In the \nchoice -of-law context, however, a lthough some states have followed the Supreme \nCourt in adopting a presumption against extraterritoriality,17 most states have \nretained elements of Currie\u2019s governmental -interest analysis. In the area of choice \nof law, the purposivism of the Legal Process School endures in weakened form. By \nclinging to the high purposivism of governmental interest analysis in the context of \nchoice of law, some states perpetuate an approach to statutory interpretation that \nthey have increasingly disfavored in other contexts.  \nIn its current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of Conflict of Laws , \nthe ALI has endorsed Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of ordinary \ninterpretation.18 At the same time, the draft Third Restatement  specifically disavows \nCurrie\u2019s interpretive approach.19 Indeed, the draft Third Restatement  departs \ndramatically from Currie\u2019s purposivist analysis. Where the legislature has left the \nissue of territorial reach unaddressed, the draft Third Restatement  does not instruct \ncourts to attempt to interpret the laws in question to effectuate the legislature\u2019s \npurposes.20 Instead, it adopts a presumption of extraterritoriality: similar in form, \nthough not in content, to the federal presumption against  extraterritoriality.21 What\u2019s \nmore, the subject -specific rules that the draft Third Restatement  adopts  for the \nresolution of conflicts leave little room for the sort of analysis of state \u201cinterests\u201d \nthat Currie favored.22 If it becomes as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  has \nbeen, the draft Third Restatement \u2019s approach would accelerate the demise of \nCurrie\u2019s purposivist approach to choice of law.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis\u2019 s approach \nto statutory interpretation in light of the revolution that has occurred in the field of \nstatutory interpretation since Currie elaborated his approach. Our aims are partly \ndescriptive and partly normative. Descriptively, we show that choice of law has been \nconceived by adherents of both traditionalist and modern approaches as, at bottom, \na matter of statutory interpre tation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum law as to its \nmulti -state app licability. Currie\u2019s innovation was to bring a particular approach to \nstatutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the highly purposive approach of the \nLegal Process School.

T he states, on the other hand, have lagged in \nbringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-law methodologies. In the states \nthat still rely on Currie\u2019s insights, governmental interest analysis is frozen in amber, \npersisti ng in an environment that has rejected its core premises. Finally, we show \nthat the draft Third Restatement  is largely consistent with the modern critique of \npurposivism. Its anticipated adoption seems poised to hasten  the demise of Currie -\nstyle interest analysis.  \nNormatively, we draw on the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism to explain the numerous ways that governmental interest analysis as \ndeveloped by Currie fails to capture any actual legislative preferences as to the \nmulti -state applicability  of laws .

But we are aware of no published article showing how the \ndecline of high purposivism has drawn into question the presuppositions of most of choice of \nlaw in the United States.  Cf. Michael S.

It then dives more deeply into the theory of governmental interest \nanalysis as first elaborated by Currie, focusing on the role played by legislative \npurpose in the interpretive enterprise. Part II examines the revolution in federal \nstatutory -interpretation theory  since Currie\u2019s time. This Part discusses the shift from \npurposivism to  textualism, focusing on the critiques of purposivism that underlay \nthe shift. Part III takes a critical look at Currie\u2019s approach to choice of law in light \nof the critiques of purposivism that have led federal courts to disavow a strongly \npurposivist appr oach to statutory interpretation.  \nPart IV explores how federal and state courts have adapted their choice -of-\nlaw approaches since the statutory interpretation revolution, with a particular focus \non presumptions against extraterritoriality. It first looks more closely at the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  express abandonment of a purposivist approach to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes and its adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality in its place. This Part then examines the landscape in the state \ncourts to determi ne the extent to which the states have been following the purposivist \napproach proposed by Currie, focusing on the states that have departed from the \ntraditional approach of the First Restatement . Although the picture is messy, we \nconclude that Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is still alive, in some form, among the \nstates.  \nFinally, Part V examines the approach of the draft Third Restatement  to the \nquestion of a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. As noted, while the draft Third \nRestatement  generally endorses Currie\u2019s view that choice of law is, at least in part, \na matter of interpreting the multi -state scope of the contending laws, in practice it \nrepresents a significant departure from Currie\u2019s theory. Both in its presumption of \nextraterritoriality and in the operation of its subject -specific choice -of-law rules, the \ndraft Third Restatement  appears destined to accelerate the shift away from Currie -\nstyle governmental interest analysis in the states.  \nI. CHOICE OF LAW AS STATUTORY INTERPRETATION , PRE- AND \nPOST-CURRIE  \nChoice -of-law issues arise when a dispute spans state boundaries. If \neverything occurred in one state and all of the parties are from that state, a court has \nno need to decide a choice -of-law question. The court decides the case according to \nthe law of the  only state having connections to the dispute. (We will call this the \npurely internal case.) A choice -of-law question arises only if the events giving rise \nto the dispute occurred in more than one state, or if the parties (or other interested \npersons) are affiliated with different states. (We will call this the multi -state case.)  \n \n 28. See John F. Coyle, Choice of Law in Terrorism Cases , 101 NOTRE DAME L. \nREV. (forthcoming 2026) (draft on file with authors).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  399 \nIn enacting statutes, legislatures will sometimes address the statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability by including what might be called an \u201cexternal scope provision.\u201d29 \nThe legislature might specify that the statute\u2019s substantive provisions apply to \npersons domiciled in the state, or to conduct that occurs in the state. When the \nlegislature has included such a provision in a statute, the question of the statute\u2019s \nmulti -state applicability is straightforwardly one of statutory interpretation \u2014it is a \nmatter of interpreting the external scope provision.30 Such provisions have \nhistorically been included in relatively few statutes, however.31 Even today, most \nstatutes lack such provisions. This Article focuses on how the courts decide the \nquestion of a law\u2019s multi -state applicability with respect to laws that do not include \nan external scope provision.  \nEven statutes that lack an external scope provision might be thought to have \na text relevant to the issue of multi -state applicability . Statutes are often phrased in \nbroad, all -encompassing terms. For example, \u00a7 33 of the Jones Act, addressing \n\u201crecovery for injury to or death of a seaman,\u201d originally extended to \u201cany seaman \nwho shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\u201d32 State statutes, \ntoo, typically extend broadly to \u201cany person.\u201d33 The courts, however, have uniformly \nrefused to read such statutes literally, reasoning that such literalism would produce \nunreasonable results. As explained by Justice Jackson in Lauritzen v. Larsen , if we \nread the Jones Act literally, we would conclude that \u201cCongress has extended our law \nand opened our courts to all alien seafaring men injured anywhere in the world in \nservice of watercraft of every foreign nation \u2014 a hand on a Chinese junk, never \noutside Chinese waters, would not be beyond its literal wording  . . . .\u201d34 In rejecting \na literal interpretation of such statutes, the courts \u2014both state and federal \u2014assume \nthat legislatures typically enact statutes with only the purely internal case in mind \nand d o not give any thought to the applicability of the statute to cases having foreign \nelements.35 Based on that assumption, the courts treat the issue of multi -state \napplicability as open to interpretation. In Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s words, the issue \nfor the courts in the face of such statutes is \u201ca problem of statutory construction \nrather commonplace in a federal system by which courts often have to decide \n \n 29. For an analysis of such provisions, see generally V\u00e1zquez, supra note 5.  \n 30. For example, the courts might have to determine if the provision requires  \napplication of the law to cases within its scope or merely permits  its application to such cases. \nThe draft Third Restatement  presumes that such provisions do not require the law\u2019s \napplication to included cases. See infra  Section V.B. \n 31. See Katherine Florey, Honoring Statutory Restraint in Conflicts Analysis , 137 \nHARV. L. REV. F. 271, 275 \u201376 (2024).  \n 32.

The Supreme Court  of Alabama \u2019s decision in \nAlabama Great Southern Railroad v. Carroll is a good example.38 Alabama had \nenacted a statute repealing the common -law fellow -servant rule, but the legislature \nhad not addressed the statute\u2019s applicability to multi -state cases.39 The injury in the \ncase had occurred in Mississippi, and the Court decided that the traditional lex loci \ndelicti  rule called for application of the law of the place where  the injury occurred.40 \nThe Alabama statute was phrased in all -encompassing language, but the Court \nassumed that the legislature had not focused on the issue of multi -state applicability . \nIt held that the statute should be interpreted to extend only to cases in which the \ninjury occurred in Alabama. In the Court\u2019s words :  \nSection 2590 of the Code  . . . is to be interpreted in the light of \nuniversally recognized principles of private international or interstate \nlaw, as if its operation had been expressly limited to this State and as \nif its first line read as follows: \u201cWhen a personal injury is received in \nAlabama by a servant or employee, \u201d etc.41 \nIn this way, the state\u2019s general choice -of-law rule ( lex loci delicti ) implicitly \ncircumscribe d the general language of the statute. The legislature was presumed to \nhave instructed the Court to apply the substantive rule only to the extent it would be \napplicable under traditional choice -of-law rules. Traditional choice -of-law rules, in \nother words, functioned as a strong -form substantive canon of interpretation.42 \nThese traditional rules continued to prevail in the states until the mid -\ntwentieth century. Their defenders claimed (unconvincingly) that these rules were \ninherent in the nature of state sovereignty.43 Some courts understood them to be part \nof the general common law.44 The rules sometimes produced harsh and seemingly \n \n 36.

But this approach promised a measure of uniformity (meaning the \nresult would be the same regardless of where suit was brought), as well as certainty \nand predictability.  \nThe traditional approach was subjected to intense criticism beginning in \nthe 1930s, largely by legal realist scholars.45 These scholars criticized the harsh and \narbitrary results the traditional approach produced, and they debunked the notion \nthat these results were required by notions of state sovereignty.46 The Erie Railroad \nCo. v. Tompkins  decision and its progeny established that absent a federal rule , \nchoice of law was a matter of the positive law of each state.47 The state courts came \nto understand that how they approached choice of law was largely up to them, and \nmany decided to reject the traditional approach.  \nThe first fully formed alternative to the traditional approach was put \nforward in the scholarship of Brainerd Currie in the 1950s and early 1960s. His key \ninsight was that the answer to the choice -of-law question should be found in the \nsubstantive laws vyi ng for application. If the question was one of interpretation, as \neven traditionalist courts appeared to recognize, the answer should be found through \napplication of the ordinary methods of statutory interpretation.48 At the time Currie \nwas writing, the prevailing approach to statutory interpretation was the highly \npurposivist approach of the Legal Process School .49 Accordingly, Currie argued that \nin interpreting laws as to their multi -state applicability, the courts should apply an \napproach that interprets statutes \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d50 \nGiven the assumptions that courts make in their posing of the question, \nhowever, the task Currie had in mind was easier said than done. Recall that most \nstatutes do not include a provision addressing the law\u2019s multi -state applicability . As \nwe have seen, the relevant laws are typically written in all -encompassing terms \u2014\ne.g., \u201cevery person .\u201d The courts decline to read the laws literally on the assumption \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind and \nneglected entirely the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. The \n\u201clegislative purpose\u201d to which Currie referred could not have been the legislature\u2019s \npurpose with respect to the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability, as by hypothesis there \nwas no intent on that specific question. Necessarily, Currie was referring to what we \n \n 45. See Perry Dane, Vested Rights, \u2018Vestedness, \u2019 and Choice of Law , 96 YALE L.J. \n1191, 1196 \u201397 (1987).  \n 46.

Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 312\u201313 (1981) (plurality opinion) ; \nsee also id.  at 332 (Powell, J., dissenting) (noting that the Due Process Clause invalidates a \nstate\u2019s application of its own law \u201cwhen there are no significant contacts between the state \nand the litigation \u201d).

The courts\u2019 task under Currie\u2019s framework was, \nthus, to interpret the statute on an issue that the legislature did not give any thought  \nto, much less memorialize in statutory text.  \nIn an early article,51 Currie illustrated his approach by examining a classic \nchoice -of-law decision from the 1890s, Milliken v. Pratt .52 Pratt was a married \nwoman from Maine who entered into a contract with Milliken, who was from \nMassachusetts.53 Under Massachusetts law, the contracts of married women were \nnot enforceable.54 Under Maine law, however, such contracts were enforceable.55 \nUnder the traditional approach to choice of law, the governing law was that of the \nplace where the contract was made, which in this case was Massachusetts. The Court \naccordingly held that the contract was not enforceable.56 \nCurrie argued that the Court should have framed the issue as whether the \nMassachusetts law invalidating such contracts, properly interpreted, was applicable \nto the contracts of married women from Maine.57 But the statute was silent on this \nquestion. The traditional approach assumed that the Massachusetts law reached all \ncontracts entered into in Massachusetts and no contracts entered into outside of \nMassachusetts.58 Currie argued that, as a reflection of \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 42,000 characters]\n\n18: Veterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court (score: 0.580)\nTopic: Prediction of Supreme Courts approach to veteranrelated legal issues\nFound via search query: Supreme Court veterans issues prediction modeling\nVeterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court | Constitution Center Skip to main content America's 250th Calendar About Support Donate Buy Tickets Loading...

Back to Blog Blog Post Veterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court October 14, 2024 | by Marcia Coyle More in Constitution Daily Blog Many of the nation\u2019s veterans have fought battles with the federal agency responsible for awarding benefits for their service-connected injuries and illnesses. This week, the veterans fight again, but in the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, their battles with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs often involved complaints about an unwieldy, lengthy, ultimately unfair, claims process that seemed to defeat the intention to create a non-adversarial, veteran-friendly system. Over time, Congress did respond to some veterans\u2019 complaints and lawsuits. One important change was Congress\u2019 creation in 1988 of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. That court is tasked with hearing veterans\u2019 appeals from allegedly erroneous decisions on their claims by the department\u2019s board of veterans appeals. The backstop to that court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Joshua Bufkin, an Air Force veteran, and Norman Thornton, an Army veteran, separately sought disability benefits for service-connected, post-traumatic stress disorder. Their claims were denied by the board of veterans appeals and those decisions were subsequently affirmed by the Veterans Court. In Bufkin v. McDonough at the Supreme Court, the two veterans argue that the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit has been misapplying a federal rule that is central to review of veterans\u2019 claims, \u201cbut its practical benefit to veterans is being eroded by the Federal Circuit\u2019s narrow reading of the scope and standard of review available to veterans at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims,\u201d according to an amicus brief by a group of lawyers who frequently represent veterans pro bono. For more than 100 years, veterans have been entitled to the benefit of the doubt on any close issue material to their eligibility for service-related benefits. When Congress created the Veterans Court in 1988, it wrote the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into the 1988 act. The rule states: \u201cw]hen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\u201d In 2002, Congress added something like an exclamation point to the law, stating that in deciding every appeal, the Veterans Court \u201cshall review the record of proceedings and \u201cshall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt statute].\u201d This provision, according to legislative reports, was adopted to give \u201cfull force to the \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 provision\u2019\u201d by empowering the Veterans Court to conduct more \u201csearching appellate review\u201d of department decisions. \u201cThe rule that the veteran, not the government, receives the benefit of the doubt in a close case is among the most fundamental and longstanding precepts in our veterans\u2019 benefits system,\u201d wrote Melanie Bostwick, who represents Bufkin and Thornton. \u201cThis standard of proof, unlike any other in civil or criminal litigation, reflects a core societal judgment that it is better to err on the side of providing benefits to those who sacrificed their own interests on behalf of the nation.\u201d Her clients have drawn supporting amicus briefs from Disabled American Veterans, Military-Veterans Advocacy, National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), and the Federal Circuit Bar Association, whose members practice before the Federal Circuit and represent or facilitate pro bono counsel for veterans. Bufkin and Thornton argue that the Veterans Court is required to make an independent, non-deferential review of the evidence before the department to determine whether there were close issues on which the veteran should have received the benefit of the doubt. The Veterans Court, they contend, is not taking that hard, independent look. \u00a0It is only examining the underlying factual findings for deferential clear error \u2014 \u201csomething already required elsewhere in the veterans\u2019 review statute.\u201d The Federal Circuit has agreed with the Veterans Court that clear error review is all that is required. The Biden Administration counters that the Secretary\u2019s decision that the evidence on a material issue is not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d is itself a factual finding and so is subject only to review for clear errors. If a claimant challenges the board\u2019s weighing of the evidence on a material issue, and the Veterans Court concludes that the Secretary\u2019s approximate-balance determination is not clearly erroneous, the government contends, the court has taken \u201cdue account\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. The National Veterans Legal Services Program argues that the text and structure of the law indicate, the \u201ctake due account\u201d provision requires the Veterans Court to separately consider the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, and that\u00a0 would improve outcomes for veterans and reduce delays in the benefits application and review process. \u201cCase backlogs have increased as remands from the Veterans Court congest the [Board of Veterans Appeals] docket, and veterans are forced to wait even longer for resolution\u201d wrote D. Shayon Ghosh for the NVLSP.\u00a0 \u201cIn short, veterans organizations like NVLSP have explained to Congress that the Veterans Court\u2019s toothless review of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule regularly resulted in misapplication of that rule and unnecessary remands that cost veterans valuable time.\u201d What is the proper standard of judicial review is a technical, even wonky, issue. And may not make for the most scintillating oral arguments. But, as the veterans\u2019 challenge here shows, the answer can be critical to the outcome of questions with often huge significance in someone\u2019s life. The justices will hear arguments on Oct. 16. You can tune in by going to https://www.supremecourt.gov and clicking on live audio.

And under \n\u00a77261(b)(1), the Veterans Court mu st \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s \napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Applying those standards, the Veterans Court affirmed the VA\u2019s adverse benefit determinations, finding that the Board\u2019s approximate-balance determinations were not \nclearly erroneous.  The petitioners then appealed to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, challenging the Veterans Co urt\u2019s legal interpretation of \n\u00a77261(b)(1), and arguing that the statutory command to \u201ctake due ac -\ncount\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires\nthe Veterans Court to review the entire record de novo and decide for \nitself whether the evidence is in approximate balance.  The Federal \nCircuit rejected this argument and affirmed. \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n  2 BUFKIN v.

Pp. 8\u201317. \n(a) Under \u00a77261(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the Veterans Court must \u201ctake \ndue account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of  the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nThis requirement directs the Vetera ns Court to give appropriate at-\ntention to the VA\u2019s work.  The Veterans Court must review the VA\u2019s \napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule \u201c[i]n making the determi-\nnations under subsection (a).\u201d  \u00a77261(b)(1). Accordingly, the standards\nof review provided in subsection (a ) also govern the Veterans Court\u2019s \nreview of benefit-of-the-doubt i ssues.  Section 7261(b)(1) makes ex -\nplicit the Veterans Cour t\u2019s previously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s\napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection (a).   Pp. 8\u201310.\n(b) The appropriate standard of review for any given challenge de-\npends on whether the challenge is fa ctual or legal in nature.  The par-\nties contest whether a veteran\u2019s challenge to the VA\u2019s determination\nthat the evidence on a particular ma terial issue is not in approximate\nbalance involves a legal inquiry subject to de novo review, or a factual \nfinding, or at least a predominantly factual, mixed question of law and fact, subject to clear-error review.\nThe approximate-balance determinat ion involves two steps.  First, \nthe VA reviews each item of evidence  and assigns weight to it\u2014a fact-\nfinding inquiry reviewed only for clear error.  Second, the VA deter-\nmines whether the evidence is in approximate balance.  See \u00a75107(b). This second step includes both le gal and factual components: factual \nbecause it involves marshaling an d weighing evidence, and legal be-\ncause the \u201capproximate balance\u201d dete rmination involves whether the \nevidence satisfies a legal standard.  The VA\u2019s approximate-balance de-\ntermination is thus at most a mixed question.  And the appropriate\nstandard of review for a mixed question depends \u201con whether answer-\ning it entails primarily legal or factual work.\u201d U. S. Bank N. A.  v. Vil-\nlage at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U. S. 387, 396. \nReviewing a determination whet her record evidence is approxi-\nmately balanced is \u201cabout as factual sounding\u201d as any question gets. \nId., at 397. In Bufkin\u2019s case, the Board weighed medical opinions and\nfamily testimony to assess his PTSD claims.  Similarly, the Board in \nThornton\u2019s case analyzed symptom severity and medical evidence to \nassess his disability rating.  Both cases demonstrate that approximate-balance determinations require case-specific factual review warrant -\ning clear-error review.

But \nhad Congress intended to do so, it would have identified a standard, \njust as it did in \u00a77261(a).  Petitioners next argue that, even if \n\u00a77261(b)(1) incorporates \u00a77261(a)\u2019s standards of review, the VA\u2019s ap-proximate-balance determination is much like a court\u2019s probable-cause\ndetermination, which involves a mixe d-question inquiry that appellate\ncourts review de novo . Ornelas  v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 699.   \nTwo features distinguish the probable-cause determination from the\nVA\u2019s determination here.  First, probable cause is a constitutional \nstandard, creating a strong presum ption that determinations under \nthat standard are subject to de novo  review. By contrast, the approxi-\nmate-balance determination is a creat ure of statute, not the Constitu-\ntion.  Second, probable cause poses a question that requires substan -\ntial \u201clegal work,\u201d U. S. Bank, 583 U. S., at 398, but the VA\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinatio n lacks a comparable legal compo-\nnent. \nPetitioners contend that the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a77261(b)(1)\nrenders the provision superfluous.  While this Court\u2019s reading of \n\u00a77261(b)(1) might involve some redundancy, the canon against sur -\nplusage does not apply here because petitioners have not identified a \ncompeting interpretation that would avoid redundancy.

DOUGLAS A. \nCOLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \nAFFAIRS \nNORMAN F. THORNTON, PETITIONER v. DOUGLAS \nA. COLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \nAFFAIRS \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n[March 5, 2025]\n JUSTICE THOMAS  delivered the opinion of the Court. \nWhen evaluating a veteran\u2019s claim for service-related dis-\nability benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \napplies a unique standard of proof known as the \u201cbenefit-of-\nthe-doubt rule.\u201d This rule requires the VA to \u201cgive the ben-\nefit of the doubt to the claimant\u201d whenever \u201cthere is an ap -\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any \nissue material to the claim.  38 U. S. C. \u00a75107(b).  When reviewing the VA\u2019s benefits decisions, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court)\nmust \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. \u00a77261(b)(1).  The question before\nus is what the Veterans Court must do to comply with thatstatutory command.  We hold that the Veterans Court must \nreview the VA\u2019s application of the rule the same way it\nwould any other determination\u2014by reviewing legal issues \nde novo  and factual issues for clear error.  See \u00a77261(a). \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 2 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nAnd, we hold that the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence \nis in approximate balance is a predominantly factual deter-\nmination reviewed only for clear error. \nI \nA \nCongress provides veterans a wide range of benefits, in-\ncluding compensation for disabilities caused or aggravatedby active-duty military servic e.  \u00a7\u00a71110, 1131. The VA, led \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, administers the laws\nthat provide for those benefits.  \u00a7\u00a7301, 303.\nVeterans who suffer from service-connected post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are among those entitledto disability benefits. To establish service-connected PTSD, \nthe VA requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition \nand linking the veteran\u2019s symptoms with an \u201cin-service \nstressor,\u201d as well as credible evidence that the in-service stressor occurred. 38 CFR \u00a73.304(f ) (2023).  When the VA \nfinds those conditions satisfied, it assigns a disability ratingthat reflects reductions in earning capacity.  38 U. S. C. \n\u00a71155; 38 CFR \u00a74.130. This rating determines the amount \nof compensation a veteran receives.\nA veteran begins the claims process by submitting a re-\nquest for benefits to the VA. A VA regional office then ad-\njudicates the claim.  If the regional office issues an adverse \ndecision, the veteran may seek de novo review from the \nBoard of Veterans\u2019 Appeals.  The Board is an administra-\ntive body within the VA that renders final decisions for the \nagency. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77101, 7104(a).\nCongress designed the VA\u2019s adjudicatory process to func-\ntion \u201c \u2018with a high degree of informality and solicitude for \nthe claimant.\u2019 \u201d  Henderson  v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 431 \n(2011) (quoting Walters  v. National Assn. of Radiation Sur -\nvivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985)).  For example, Congress imposes no statute of limitations on a veteran\u2019s claim for \nbenefits. The process at both the regional offices and the \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  3 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nBoard is ex parte and nonadversarial.  38 CFR \u00a7\u00a73.103(a),\n20.700(c). And, the VA must assist veterans in developing\nthe evidence necessary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103A(a)(1).\nCongress also requires the re gional offices and the Board \nto give veterans the benefit of  the doubt on close issues.\nSpecifically, the VA must \u201cconsider all information and lay and medical evidence of record,\u201d and, \u201c[w]hen there is anapproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re-\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat-\nter, the [VA] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claim-\nant.\u201d \u00a75107(b).  This rule reflects a pro-veteran policy\nchoice that dates back to the post-Civil War era. See 50 Fed. Reg. 34454 (1985).\nA veteran who receives an adverse decision from the \nBoard may appeal to the Vete rans Court, an Article I tribu-\nnal. The Veterans Court has exclusive jurisdiction to re -\nview final decisions of the Board.  \u00a77252(a).\nSection 7261 defines the scope of the Veterans Court\u2019s re-\nview. Subsection (a), which sets forth the court\u2019s adjudica-tory powers, is modeled after the scope-of-review provision \nin the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706. It empowers the Veter ans Court to decide relevant \nquestions of law; to compel action unlawfully withheld or\nunreasonably delayed; and to hold unlawful and set aside \nVA findings, conclusions, rules, and regulations that are ar-bitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.  38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1)\u2013(3).  Un-\nlike the APA, however, \u00a77261(a) imposes a slightly different \nstandard of review for factual findings. The Veterans Court \nmay set aside or reverse a factual finding only if \u201cthe find-ing is clearly erroneous,\u201d in contrast to the APA\u2019s \u201csubstan -\ntial evidence\u201d standard.  \u00a77261(a)(4); see Dickinson v. \nZurko , 527 U. S. 150, 153, 162\u2013163 (1999) (examining the\n\u201csubtle\u201d difference between the two standards).\nSubsection (b) sets forth ad ditional requirements that the \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nVeterans Court must follow \u201c[i]n making the determina-\ntions under subsection (a).\u201d  \u00a77261(b). As originally en-\nacted, the provision required only that the Veterans Court\u201c\u2018take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\u2019 \u201d  Veter-\nans\u2019 Judicial Review Act, \u00a7301(a), 102 Stat. 4115 (now cod-ified at 38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2)).  We have held that this \nstatutory command requires the Veterans Court to apply \nthe same kind of harmless-error rule that courts ordinarilyapply in civil cases. Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U. S. 396, 406 \n(2009).\nIn 2002, Congress amended subsection (b) to add the pro-\nvision at issue here. Veterans Benefits Act, \u00a7401(b), 116 Stat. 2832. Codified at \u00a77261(b)(1), it directs the VeteransCourt to \u201c \u2018take due account of the [ VA]\u2019s application of sec-\ntion 5107(b) of this title.\u2019 \u201d  In other words, when conducting\njudicial review under subsection (a), the Veterans Court \nmust \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nIn most cases, an appeal to  the Veterans Court is a vet-\neran\u2019s final opportunity for judici al review of a benefits de-\ncision. Although veterans ma y appeal certain legal issues\nto the United States Court of  Appeals for the Federal Cir-\ncuit, see \u00a77292, that court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to review most factual dete rminations, including whether \nthe VA properly applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule in in -\ndividual cases, see Ferguson v. Principi , 273 F. 3d 1072, \n1076 (2001). \nB \nPetitioners are veterans who applied for service-\nconnected PTSD disability benefi ts and were dissatisfied \nwith the VA\u2019s resolution of their claims. \n1 \nPetitioner Joshua Bufkin served in the Air Force from \nlate 2005 to early 2006. Although Bufkin intended to join \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nthe military police, he never received a job assignment be-\ncause he could not pass the required training classes.\nBufkin blamed his poor performance on marital stress. He reported that his wife opposed his service and had threat-\nened to commit suicide if he st ayed in the military.  Bufkin \nultimately requested and obtained a nonprejudicial hard-ship discharge.\nSeven years later, Bufkin sought disability benefits from \nthe VA. He claimed that his military service caused several psychiatric conditions, including PTSD. To support his \nPTSD claim, Bufkin submitted a letter from a VA physicianwho had recently treated him. The physician explained\nthat Bufkin\u2019s wife suffered from depression, and that \nBufkin felt forced to make a choice between divorcing his \nwife or leaving the military.  The physician diagnosedBufkin with PTSD and opined that the primary stressor was the perceived threat to his wife\u2019s life. \nThe VA regional office denied Bufkin\u2019s claim on the \nground that the medical evidence was insufficient to estab-\nlish a link between his symptoms and his military service. \nBufkin sought reconsideration, and the VA ordered a sec-ond examination by a second VA physician.  The new phy-\nsician determined that Bufkin did not meet the criteria for \nPTSD. He explained that the first physician was unable to\nreview Bufkin\u2019s military or medical records, a limitation \nthat may have had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Bufkin\u2019s initialdiagnosis. App. in No. 2022\u20131089 (CA Fed.), pp. 29\u201330. \nBufkin also submitted letters from his wife and mother de -\nscribing changes they observed  in his personality after his\nmilitary service.\nThe VA regional office revi ewed the new information and \nreaffirmed its denial of Bufkin\u2019s claim.  Bufkin filed a notice of disagreement.  He argued that the evidence for and \nagainst his claim was roughly equal and that he was there-\nfore entitled to \u201cthe benefit of the doubt.\u201d  \u00a75107(b).  Bufkin \nthen underwent a third VA examination by yet another \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nphysician. Like the second physician, this physician con-\ncluded that Bufkin\u2019s symptoms  did not meet the criteria for\nPTSD. She also noted that Bufkin\u2019s symptoms started one \nyear after his discharge, and that no evidence indicated that his military service caused a disability.  The VA re -\ngional office again reaffirmed its decision to deny benefits. \nBufkin appealed to the Board. While the appeal was\npending, he submitted a short statement from a fourth phy-\nsician. This physician stated that, in his opinion, Bufkin \nsuffered from PTSD, but he no ted other doctors might dis-\nagree with that diagnosis.  He suggested that, at a mini-\nmum, Bufkin suffered from severe anxiety disorder. \nThe Board concluded that Bufkin did not suffer from \nPTSD and denied his claim. In a detailed opinion, the\nBoard recounted each physici an\u2019s findings and medical con-\nclusions. The Board observed that one physician diagnosed \nBufkin with PTSD, two physicians determined he did not \nhave PTSD, and one physician thought the issue was debat-\nable. After carefully reviewing each medical opinion, the\nBoard explained that it found the second physician\u2019s report \n\u201cespecially persuasive.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.  The Board noted that the one physician to diagnose Bufkin with\nPTSD had not reviewed his military or medical records.\nThe Board also reviewed the letters from Bufkin\u2019s wife and \nmother but found that they lacked probative value because \nneither individual had relev ant medical expertise.  When \ntaken as a whole, the Board explained, the evidence was not\nin approximate balance. Accordingly, the Board deter-\nmined that Bufkin was not enti tled to the benefit of the \ndoubt. \n2 \nPetitioner Norman Thornton served in the Army from\n1988 to 1991.

The VA granted benefits\nfor the PTSD claim, initially rating his condition as 10%\ndisabling and later increasing the rating to 30%.\nIn 2015, Thornton applied for another increase to his\nPTSD disability rating and underwent a new VA medical\nexamination. The physician concluded that Thornton suf-\nfered some common PTSD symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, memory loss, and sleep impairment, but \nquestioned whether PTSD was the cause of those symp-\ntoms. The physician did not find several of the more severe \nsymptoms that earlier medical examinations had revealed,\nsuch as suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, and panic attacks.  Nevertheless, the regional office increased\nThornton\u2019s PTSD disability rati ng to 50%.  Thornton then \nsought an additional increase to 70% and underwent an -\nother medical evaluation, but the regional office main-tained the 50% rating.\nThornton appealed to the Board, which reviewed the evi-\ndence de novo. As in Bufkin\u2019s case, the Board thoroughly\nrecounted each medical report and assessed the credibility \nof each physician\u2019s findings. The Board ultimately declined\nto increase Thornton\u2019s 50% disability rating.\n1 \n3 \nBoth petitioners appealed the Board\u2019s resolution of their\nPTSD claims to the Veterans Court. They argued that the\nevidence concerning their diagnoses was in \u201capproximate\nbalance,\u201d so they were entitled to the benefit of the doubt.See \u00a75107(b).  In both cases, the Veterans Court upheld \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1At the same time, the Board granted Thornton a \u201ctotal disability\u201d rat-\ning for his separate claim of unemplo yability, based on the combined ef -\nfect of his service-connected PTSD an d the undiagnosed illness.  App. to \nPet. for Cert. 86a\u201389a.  Thornton currently receives full benefits, but \nthose benefits are subject to continual review.

COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nthe Board\u2019s decisions on the ground that the Board\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinatio ns were not clearly erro-\nneous. \nThe petitioners then appealed to the Federal Circuit,\nchallenging the Veterans Court\u2019s legal interpretation of \n\u00a77261(b)(1). They argued that the statutory command to\n\u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-\nthe-doubt rule requires the Veterans Court to review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evi -\ndence is in approximate balance.\nThe Federal Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed \nthe Veterans Court in both cases.  75 F. 4th 1368 (2023); 2023 WL 5091653 (Aug. 9, 2023).  The court held that \u201cthe statutory command that the Veterans Court \u2018take due ac -\ncount\u2019 of the benefit of the doubt rule does not require the Veterans Court to conduct any review of the benefit of the \ndoubt issue beyond the clear error review required by\u201d\n\u00a77261(a). Id., at *2. \nWe granted certiorari to decide what it means to \u201ctake\ndue account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. 601 U.

The word \u201cdue\u201d qualifies the attention that the \nVA must give. \u201cDue\u201d means \u201capp ropriate\u201d or \u201cproper.\u201d  See \n4 Oxford English Dictionary 1105 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cMerited,\nappropriate: proper, right\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 515\n(7th ed. 1999) (\u201cJust, proper, regular, and reasonable\u201d).\nTaken together, the statutory command to \u201ctake due ac-\ncount\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires the Veterans Cou rt to give appropriate atten-\ntion to the VA\u2019s work, at least when the issue is properly presented. See id., at 516 (defining \u201cdue consideration\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he degree of attention properly paid to something, as the circumstances merit\u201d).\n2 \nThe text makes clear that the appropriate attention due\nis that which is required under subsection (a).

Review of the VA\u2019s \nbenefit-of-the-doubt decision is just another determination\nmade \u201cunder subsection (a).\u201d \u00a77261(b)(1).  Accordingly, thestandards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern \nthe Veterans Court\u2019s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues. \nIn particular, subsection (a) requires the Veterans Court toreview the VA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo  and its findings\nof fact for clear error. See \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1) and (4). Which \nstandard applies will depend on whether a veteran raises a \nlegal or factual objection. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2Petitioners invite us to decide whether the Veterans Court must ad-\ndress the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule when a veteran \ndoes not raise the issue as a ground for reversal.  Because both petition-ers adequately preserved and raised their challenges below, we leave\nthat question for another day. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nSection 7261(b)(1) makes explicit the Veterans Court\u2019s\npreviously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s application of \nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set \nforth in subsection (a).  Of course, this duty predated Con-\ngress\u2019s enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1); subsection (a) always re-\nquired the Veterans Court to revi ew all relevant findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.  See \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1) and (4). But, Congress\u2019s enactment underscores the benefit-of-the-doubt rule\u2019s status as a paramount consideration. \nB \nThe next question, then, is the appropriate standard of\nreview for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-\nof-the-doubt rule. The applicable standard will vary with the challenge, as the application of the rule has both factual \nand legal components. A veteran may challenge any aspect\nof the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule onappeal.\nNo one disputes that challenges to the VA\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions are subject to de novo  review. For example, if the vet-\neran argues that the VA misunderstood the definition of \u201capproximate balance,\u201d the Ve terans Court would construe \nthe challenge as a legal one and review it de novo . So too if \nthe veteran argues that the VA gave the benefit of the doubt to the wrong party.\nThese arguments, however, are not the typical argu-\nments a veteran raises on appeal.  In mine-run cases, in-\ncluding the two before us, a veteran challenges the VA\u2019s de-\ntermination that the evidence on a particular material issue is not in approximate balance. \nPetitioners assert that the approximate-balance determi-\nnation is a legal inquiry subject to de novo review. The Gov-\nernment counters that the determination is a factual find-ing, or at least a mixed question that is predominantly factual and reviewed for clear error.  After closely examin-\ning the way in which the VA conducts the approximate -\n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 11 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nbalance inquiry, we conclude it is a predominantly factual \nquestion and thus subject to clear-error review.\nThe approximate-balance determination involves two \nsteps. First, the VA reviews each item of evidence in the record and assigns weight to it.  Both sides agree that this\naspect of the VA\u2019s analysis is factfinding reviewed only for \nclear error. Second, the VA assesses the weight of the evi-\ndence as a whole, deciding whether \u201cthere is an approxi-mate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any ma-\nterial issue.  \u00a75107(b). The VA gives the benefit of the doubt \nto the veteran only after dete rmining that the positive evi-\ndence and negative evidence on a material issue are in ap-\nproximate balance. Otherwise, the VA simply resolves the \nissue in favor of the party with the more persuasive evi-\ndence. \nThe second step\u2014deciding whether the evidence as a\nwhole is approximately balanced\u2014has both legal and fac-tual components. The task is partly factual because it in-\nvolves marshaling and weighing evidence.  See U. S. Bank \nN. A.  v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U. S. 387, 396 \n(2018). The VA must categorize the evidence based on \nwhether it supports or undermines the veteran\u2019s claim. Af -\nter doing so, the VA compares th e relative strength and per-\nsuasiveness of the evidence on each side.  Assigning weightto evidence\u2014whether individual pieces of evidence or col-\nlections of it\u2014is an inherently factual task. See ibid.   But, \nthe VA\u2019s decision also involves a legal determination.  After \nassessing the weight of the assorted evidence, the VA must decide whether the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d\nSee \u00a75107(b).  In other words, the VA must determine \nwhether the evidence satisfies a legal standard.  Because \nthe VA\u2019s approximate-balance de termination involves both \nlegal and factual work, it is at most a mixed question, not a \n  \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \npurely legal one.3 \nThe appropriate standard of review for a mixed question\ndepends \u201con whether answering it entails primarily legal or\nfactual work.\u201d U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 396.  Some mixed \nquestions require a court to \u201ce xpound on the law\u201d by \u201cam -\nplifying or elaborating on a broad legal standard.\u201d Ibid. \nWhen applying the law involves developing legal principles for use in future cases, appella te courts typically review the \ndecision de novo . Ibid.  Other mixed questions require \ncourts to resolve \u201ccase-spe cific factual issues.\u201d Ibid. When \nthe tribunal below is \u201cimmerse[d] \u201d in facts and compelled to\n\u201cmarshal and weigh evidence\u201d and \u201cmake credibility judg-ments,\u201d the appellate court \u201cshould usually review a deci-\nsion with deference.\u201d Ibid. \nReviewing a determination wh ether record evidence is \napproximately balanced is \u201cabout as factual sounding\u201d as \nany question gets. Id., at 397.  Consider Bufkin\u2019s case. To \ndecide whether Bufkin was entitled to the benefit of the \ndoubt, the Board reviewed four medical opinions and two \nletters from Bufkin\u2019s family  members.  After assigning \nweight to each item, the Board assessed whether the evi -\ndence was roughly equal. To make that determination, the Board had to consider evidence of Bufkin\u2019s symptoms and \ntheir causes, while assessing the credibility of the physi-\ncians who treated him. Thornton\u2019s case is no different.  The \nBoard assessed the weight of his symptoms, the degree \nto which they affected his day-to-day life, and the credi-bility of each physician.  These cases illustrate that the \napproximate-balance determination necessarily immerses \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3We need not decide whether the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determi-\nnation is best characterized as a mixed question or a factual one. See \nAlexander  v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP , 602 U. S. 1, \n18\u201319 (2024) (observing that \u201ca finding of fact\u201d may involve applicationof a \u201cstandard of proof \u201d with a \u201csubstantial legal component\u201d).  Whether \nthe determination is mixed or factual, clear-error review is appropriate \nbecause it is at least predominantly factual. \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n 13 Cite as: 604 U.

Ibid. \nC \nPetitioners and the dissent offer various paths to a differ-\nent result. But, their arguments are not persuasive. \nFirst, petitioners urge us to hold that with one modest\nphrase, \u201ctake due account,\u201d Congress imposed a new stand-\nard of review for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Be fore the Federal Circuit, peti -\ntioners argued that \u00a77261(b)(1) established a de novo  stand-\nard of review.  They hesitate to call the standard \u201c de novo \nreview\u201d before this Court, in stead describing it as \u201cAPA -\nplus.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25, 41\u201342. \nHowever labeled, the directive  to \u201ctake due account\u201d does \nnot do the work that petitioners envision.  Had Congress intended to impose a new standard of review for challenges \nto the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, it would have clearly named a standard\u2014just as it did in \n\u00a77261(a). But, as we have explained, Congress chose not to \nannounce any new standard in \u00a77261(b)(1).  It instead in-\ncorporated the pre-existing standards of review set forth in\nsubsection (a). \nPetitioners contend, in the alternative, that even if \n\u00a77261(b)(1) incorporates the standards of review in \u00a77261(a), the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is a \nlegal question subject to de novo review under \u00a77261(a).\nThe dissent adopts a similar view, arguing that the approx-imate-balance determination is a predominantly legal \nmixed question. Post, at 12\u201316 (opinion of J\nACKSON , J.). \nThe de novo standard applies, they say, because the \napproximate-balance determination resembles other legalor predominantly legal quest ions that courts review de \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n 14 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nnovo . They point to judicial review of a court\u2019s probable-\ncause determination as one such analogue.  Post, at 14\u201315. \nProbable cause is the standard by which a court assesses \nwhether a police officer\u2019s search or seizure was permissible \nunder the Fourth Amendment.  For example, \u201cprobablecause to search . . . exist[s] where the known facts and cir -\ncumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a \ncrime will be found.\u201d  Ornelas  v. United States, 517 U. S. \n690, 696 (1996).  We have held that this inquiry is a mixedquestion that courts review de novo . See id., at 699. \nTwo features of the probable-cause determination distin-\nguish it from the approximate-balance determination, how -\never, and underscore why courts review it de novo . First, \nbecause probable cause is a constitutional standard, we \nstart with a strong presumptio n that determinations under \nthat standard are subject to de novo  review, even if they\nrequire courts to \u201cplung[e] into a factual record.\u201d U. S. \nBank, 583 U. S., at 396, n. 4.  Second, probable cause at bot-\ntom poses a question that requires substantial \u201clegal work.\u201d \nId., at 398.  Because probable cause asks whether the \u201cof-\nficer\u2019s understanding of the facts and his understanding ofthe relevant law\u201d was \u201creasonable,\u201d Heien  v. North Caro-\nlina, 574 U. S. 54, 61\u201364 (2014), it requires an objective, le-\ngally grounded inquiry as to what a hypothetical person \ncould have found, see Kentucky  v. King , 563 U. S. 452, 464 \n(2011). The answer to how a hypothetical person would act \nis, by its nature, one that cou rts refine over time, building\nout principles that \u201cacquire content only through applica-tion.\u201d Ornelas , 517 U. S., at 697.  De novo review is there-\nfore essential so that courts can ensure \u201cunif[orm] prece -\ndent\u201d that will \u201cprovid[e] law enforcement officers with a \ndefined set of rules which, in most instances, makes it pos-sible to reach a correct determination beforehand as to \nwhether an invasion of privacy is justified.\u201d  Ibid.  (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n 15 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nThe VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination differs on \nboth counts. First, the standard is a creature of statute. \nBecause it does not dwell \u201c[i]n the constitutional realm,\u201d it is not entitled to the presumption of de novo  review that \napplies to probable cause.  U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 396, \nn. 4. Second, the approximate-balance inquiry does not \nhave a comparable legal component. Instead, as these cases exemplify, that inquiry tends to be case specific and fact in -\ntensive, with courts evaluating the weight of the evidence \nfor and against a particular ve teran\u2019s claim.  To decide \nBufkin\u2019s claim, for example, the VA reviewed a panoply ofmedical and lay evidence, and Bufkin\u2019s central argument \nbefore the Veterans Court was that the overall balance of this evidence was closer than the VA thought.  Thornton\u2019s \nclaim similarly presented case-specific, fact-bound issues\nabout the existence and severity of symptoms. Resolution \nof these claims is unlikely to generate guidance for the VA\nor future courts in the way that probable-cause precedentsdo for police and the courts.\n The VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is likewise \ndistinct from a court\u2019s conclusion that evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction , a conclusion that courts\nreview de novo . See Jackson v. Virginia , 443 U. S. 307, \n318\u2013319 (1979). While the sufficiency-of-the-evidence in-quiry necessarily turns on facts, the reviewing court does\nnot decide for itself whether the evidence establishes guilt \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  Instead, it construes all evi-dence and makes all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, and asks whether \u201c any rational trier of fact \ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 319. Courts therefore conduct \ntheir review through a legal le ns, applying a hypothetical, \nobjective standard and putting a thumb on the scale in fa -\nvor of the prevailing party\u2014the prosecution. No one\u2014peti-tioners and the dissent included\u2014wants the Veterans Court to do that. Instead, petitioners and the dissent would \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 16 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nhave the Veterans Court \u201cweigh the evidence\u201d in the first\ninstance and then make \u201cinferences from basic facts to ulti-\nmate facts\u201d\u2014precisely what a court may not d o  o n  s u f f i -\nciency review. Ibid. \nPetitioners and the dissent also rely heavily on the asser-\ntion that our reading of \u00a77261(b)(1) renders the provision\nsuperfluous. Post, at 9\u201311. That objection is a serious one.\n\u201cWe are reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage inany setting.\u201d TRW Inc.  v. Andrews , 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Our reluctance in-\ncreases when Congress amends a statute, as we ordinarily \npresume that when Congress does so, \u201c \u2018it intends its\namendment to have real and substantial effect.\u2019 \u201d  Intel \nCorp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. , 542 U. S. 241, 258\u2013 \n259 (2004).\nBut, our reading of \u00a77261(b)(1) gives that provision a \nfunction, even if it might involve some redundancy.  As we \nhave explained, Congress\u2019s amendment makes express the \nVeterans Court\u2019s obligation to review challenges to the VA\u2019s\napplication of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule according to the \nstandards set forth in \u00a77261(a).  Moreover, as the dissent notes, we have left open th e possibility that Congress\u2019s en-\nactment requires the Veterans Court to review the VA\u2019s ap -\nplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule even if the veteranfails to present that issue on appeal.  See n. 2, supra; post, \nat 10. If the Court were to decide that Congress\u2019s enact-ment changed the party-presentation requirement, thenthe enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1) would serve an additional in-\ndependent function.\nNotably, the dissent fails to offer a reading of the text that\navoids redundancy. According to the dissent, the VA\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinat ion is a predominantly le-\ngal question subject to de novo  review. Post, at 12\u201316. But, \nif the dissent were correct, then the approximate-balance determination would have been subject to de novo  review \neven before the enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1).

Thus, under the dissent\u2019s interpreta-\ntion\u2014no less than ours\u2014the enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1) merely underscores a pre-existing duty.  The canon against \nsurplusage can be meaningful when a competing interpre -\ntation would avoid superfluity. Microsoft Corp.  v. i4i L. P., \n564 U. S. 91, 106 (2011).  But, when both interpretations involve the same redundancy, the canon against surplusage\nsimply does not apply. See Marx  v. General Revenue Corp. , \n568 U. S. 371, 385 (2013) (declining to apply the canonagainst surplusage when no interpretation would give ef-\nfect to every word).\nIn any event, \u201c[s]ometimes the better overall reading of \nthe statute contains some redundancy.\u201d  Rimini Street, Inc. \nv. Oracle USA, Inc. , 586 U. S. 334, 346 (2019).  Here, the \ntext leaves no doubt that the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading ofthe statute is the better one. \n* * * \nSection 7261(b)(1) does not establish a new standard of\nreview for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-\nof-the-doubt rule.

Bogue** \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United States and \nheavily influenced the Second Restatement of the Conflict of Laws , the most widely \nfollowed method of resolving conflicts among the 50 states. The key insight that this \nlegal revolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question. Proponents claimed legitimacy for the theory on the \nground s that it was more faithful to legislative preferences than the then -prevailing \nappro aches. But the theory is based on the highly purposive approach to \ninterpreting statutes championed by the Legal Process School, whose methods \ndominated statutory interpretation around the time the theory was developed. Since \nthat time, statutory interpret ation has undergone a revolution of its own. The high \npurposivism of the Legal Process School has been mostly repudiated. Few would \nnow maintain, as Brainerd Currie (the father of governmental interest analysis) did, \nthat courts faced with statutory silenc e on a question should try to imagine how the \nlegislature would have resolved the question.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis in light of the \nrevolution that has occurred in the field of statutory interpretation since Currie \nelaborated his approach. We agree that choice of law can be understood as a matter \nof interpr eting forum law with respect to its applicability to multi -state cases. But, \ndrawing from the textualist critique of the high purposivism of the Legal Process \nera, we show that Currie -style governmental interest analysis cannot claim \nlegitimacy as more fai thful to legislative preferences than other possible interpretive \napproaches. Consistent with its general shift away from purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation, the U.S. Supreme Court has updated its approach to federal choice \nof law through the adoption  of a presumption against extraterritoriality. The states, \non the other hand, have lagged in bringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-\n \n *  Scott K.

In \nthe states that continue to follow Currie, governmental interest analysis is frozen in \namber, persisting in an environment that has rejected its core premises.  \nThe American Law Institute\u2019s current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of \nthe Conflict of Laws  may accelerate the end of Currie -style governmental interest \nanalysis. The draft Third Restatement  endorses Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is \na matter of statutory interpretation (at least in part). At the same time, however, it \ndramatically revises Currie\u2019s legacy by mostly rejecting his purposivist approach \nto interpretation. The draft Third Restatement \u2019s disavowal of an overtly purposivist \napproach is broadly consistent with the modern critique of purposivism. If  the draft \nThird Restatement  becomes  as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  was, it \nwould hasten  the demise of Currie -style interest analysis.  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nINTRODUCTION  ................................ ................................ ................................ ......393 \nI.

That approach, \nknown as \u201cgovernmental interest  analysis,\u201d now appears to be facing the music. \nFederal courts have all but abandoned it, and while state courts continue to apply it, \nthey do so haphazardly, its persistence sitting  uncomfortably alongside  their \nembrace of non -purposivist methods of statutory interpretation. To the extent it \nsurvives, governmental interest analysis is a relic of a prior age, adrift in the current \njurisprudential environment. Current efforts by the American Law Institute  (\u201cALI\u201d)  \nto chart the future of choice of law reveal t hat legal commentators are forsaking \ngovernmental interest analysis in practice, even while professing fealty to its \ntheoretical foundations. It is now clear that whatever the merits or demerits of the \ntextualism that has largely replaced it, the broad rep udiation of a certain form of \npurposivism is leading to a fundamental reworking of American choice of law. This \nArticle describes and defends this development in U.S. choice of law.  \nGovernmental interest analysis revolutionized choice of law in the United \nStates, largely displacing the approach that had previously prevailed here and that \nstill prevails in most of the rest of the world.2 The key insight that this legal \nrevolution was based on was that choice of law is a matter of interpreting the \nsubstantive laws in question.3 As explained by Brainerd Currie, the theorist behind \n \n 1.

This \npart of choice of law, he said, could be understood as ordinary legal analysis. \u201d); Kermit \nRoosevelt III & Bethan R.

See Brainerd Currie , Notes on Methods and Objectives in the \nConflict of Laws , 1959 DUKE L.J.  171, 177\u201378 (1959) . \n394 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \ngovernmental interest analysis, the choice -of-law process \u201cis essentially the familiar \n[process] of construction or interpretation.\u201d4 If the legislature has addressed a law\u2019s \napplicability to cases having foreign elements, the court follows the legislature\u2019s \ndirection. But usually , a legislature enacts laws without addressing their multi -state \napplicability.5 Even in the face of legislative silence on this question, however, the \nquestion for Currie remained one of interpretation: \u201cJust as we determine by [the] \nprocess [of statutory interpretation] how a statute applies in time, and how it applies \nto marginal d omestic situations, so we may determine how it should be applied to \ncases involving foreign elements in order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d6 \nOn closer examination, it turns out that Currie\u2019s true innovation was not to \nregard choice of law as a matter of interpretation, but rather to bring a particular \napproach to interpretation  to bear on the question. The traditional choice -of-law \nrules already operated as substantive canons of interpretation, implicitly limiting the \nmulti -state applicability of forum law  in the absence of a contrary legislative \ninstruction.7 Currie\u2019s approach to interpretation differed. He adopted the approach \nthat prevailed at the time he was writing, leading him to interpret laws  as to their \nmulti -state applicability \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d8 Currie \n \n 4. Currie , supra note 3 , at 178.  \n 5. We use the term \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d to refer to a statute \u2019s applicability \nto cases having out -of-state elements \u2014such as a case that involves some out -of-state conduct \nor an out -of-state party.  We distinguish such cases from cases where all of the conduct took \nplace in the same state and all of the parties are from the state, which we refer to as the purely \ninternal case.  We use the term \u201cstate\u201d to include both states of the United States (New York, \nCalifornia) and states in the international sense (France, India).  \n  The draft Third Restatement  prefers to refer to a law \u2019s multi -state scope or \nreach . See infra  Section V.A; RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. B (AM. \nL. INST., Tentative Draft No. 3, 2023) . We avoid those terms to remain agnostic about the \ndraft Third Restatement \u2019s view that the relevant question (in the first step of the analysis it \nproposes) is the substantive scope or reach of the law.  An alternative way to understand the \nquestion is as relating to whether forum courts should apply  a given law to a multi -state case \neven if the law technically reaches the case as a substantive matter.  See Carlos M. V\u00e1zquez, \nNon-Extraterritoriality , 137 HARV. L. REV. 1290, 1347 \u201353 (2024).  This is the way the draft \nThird Restatement  understands the second step of the analysis, and we think the first step can \nbe understood this way as well.  See id. Currie himself appears to have understood the question \nat the first step in this sense.  See id.  at 1320 n.133.  For a discussion of the two ways of \nunderstanding the question, see infra  Section  V.B.  Because we do not take a position on this \nquestion here, we use the more inclusive term \u201cmulti -state applicability. \u201d \n 6. Currie, supra note 3, at 178.  \n 7. See infra  note 37 and accompanying text. Indeed, the idea  that choice of law \nis about statutory interpretation has ancient roots. See Hessell E. Yntema,  The Historic Bases \nof Private International Law , 2 AM. J. COMP AR. L. 297, 303 (1953) (\u201cThe  jurists in the \nmedieval Italian and French universities, who first elaborated conflicts law in  commentaries \non the lex Cunctos populos  (C. 1, 1, 1), and their successors in succeeding  centuries,  \ncommonly assumed that the solution of conflicts of laws was essentially a matter  of statutory \ninterpretation, of classifying statutes as real or personal with respect to  their spheres of \napplication.\u201d).  \n 8. See supra  text accompanying note 6. This idea goes back centuries as well.  \nSee Friedrich K. Juenger, A Page of History , 35 MERCER L. REV. 419, 433 (1984) (quoting \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  395 \nrejected one approach to statutory interpretation, under which a statute that is silent \nregarding multi -state applicability  would be interpreted in the light of traditional \nchoice -of-law rules, and replaced it with the highly purposivist approach to statutory \ninterpretation of the Legal Process School. In his words, a court  engaging in a \nchoice -of-law analysis  should \u201ctr[y] to decide [the question] as it believes [the \nlegislature] would have decided [it] had it foreseen the problem.\u201d9 According to \nCurrie, the purpose behind a given common -law rule or statute would tell us  whether \nthe enacting state had an interest in having the law applied, which would in turn lead \nto a determination about which state\u2019s law should be applied to a given case.10 This \napproach has become known as the \u201cgovernmental interest analysis\u201d approach to \nchoice of law.11 \nSince Currie\u2019s time, however, statutory -interpretation theory  has \nundergone  a revolution  of its own .12 In particular, the Supreme Court has forcefully \nchallenged approaches to statutory interpretation that ask how a legislature \u201cwould \nhave decided\u201d a question under an enacted statute. The Court has disdained the \npurposivism of the Legal Process School and embraced a far more textualist \napproach. This statutory -interpretation revolution has influenced the Court\u2019s \napproach when determining the applicability of federal statutes to cases having \nforeign elements. Expressly disavowing an approach that s eeks to \u201cdivin[e] what \nCongress would have wanted if it had thought of the situation before the court,\u201d13 \nthe Court has adopted a \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d14 Like Currie, the \nSupreme C ourt regard s the issue as one of interpreting the substantive statute in \nquestion, but unlike Currie, it presume s that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear \nindication of an extraterri torial application, it has none.\u201d15 Focusing largely, if not \nexclusively, on the statute\u2019s text, federal courts now interpret federal statutes to \napply only domestically unless Congress has affirmatively addressed the question \nof the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability .16 \n \nGuy de Coquille, who argued in the sixteenth century that the distinction between real and \npersonal laws should not depend \u201con the mere shell of words, but on . . . the presumed and \napparent purpose of those who have enacted the statute or custom.\u201d (quotin g 1 A.

For their part, the states have largely followed their \nfederal brethren in rejecting high purposivism  in statutory interpretation . In the \nchoice -of-law context, however, a lthough some states have followed the Supreme \nCourt in adopting a presumption against extraterritoriality,17 most states have \nretained elements of Currie\u2019s governmental -interest analysis. In the area of choice \nof law, the purposivism of the Legal Process School endures in weakened form. By \nclinging to the high purposivism of governmental interest analysis in the context of \nchoice of law, some states perpetuate an approach to statutory interpretation that \nthey have increasingly disfavored in other contexts.  \nIn its current project of elaborating a Third Restatement of Conflict of Laws , \nthe ALI has endorsed Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of ordinary \ninterpretation.18 At the same time, the draft Third Restatement  specifically disavows \nCurrie\u2019s interpretive approach.19 Indeed, the draft Third Restatement  departs \ndramatically from Currie\u2019s purposivist analysis. Where the legislature has left the \nissue of territorial reach unaddressed, the draft Third Restatement  does not instruct \ncourts to attempt to interpret the laws in question to effectuate the legislature\u2019s \npurposes.20 Instead, it adopts a presumption of extraterritoriality: similar in form, \nthough not in content, to the federal presumption against  extraterritoriality.21 What\u2019s \nmore, the subject -specific rules that the draft Third Restatement  adopts  for the \nresolution of conflicts leave little room for the sort of analysis of state \u201cinterests\u201d \nthat Currie favored.22 If it becomes as widely adopted as the Second Restatement  has \nbeen, the draft Third Restatement \u2019s approach would accelerate the demise of \nCurrie\u2019s purposivist approach to choice of law.  \nThis Article critically examines governmental interest analysis\u2019 s approach \nto statutory interpretation in light of the revolution that has occurred in the field of \nstatutory interpretation since Currie elaborated his approach. Our aims are partly \ndescriptive and partly normative. Descriptively, we show that choice of law has been \nconceived by adherents of both traditionalist and modern approaches as, at bottom, \na matter of statutory interpre tation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum law as to its \nmulti -state app licability. Currie\u2019s innovation was to bring a particular approach to \nstatutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the highly purposive approach of the \nLegal Process School.

We show \nthat the U.S. Supreme Court has drawn on developments in statutory -interpretation \ntheory in departing from overtly purposivist approaches to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes. T he states, on the other hand, have lagged in \nbringing these lessons to bear on their choice -of-law methodologies. In the states \nthat still rely on Currie\u2019s insights, governmental interest analysis is frozen in amber, \npersisti ng in an environment that has rejected its core premises. Finally, we show \nthat the draft Third Restatement  is largely consistent with the modern critique of \npurposivism. Its anticipated adoption seems poised to hasten  the demise of Currie -\nstyle interest analysis.  \nNormatively, we draw on the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism to explain the numerous ways that governmental interest analysis as \ndeveloped by Currie fails to capture any actual legislative preferences as to the \nmulti -state applicability  of laws . We are not the first to point out that interest analysis \ndoes not capture legislative preferences,23 but we contribute to this debate by \nbringing modern statutory -interpretation theory \u2014in particular, the modern critique \nof purposivism \u2014to bear on the question. The relationship between the choice -of-\nlaw revolution and the revolution in statutory interpretation has thus far gone largely \nunaddressed.24 This Article fills that gap by showing how, sub silentio , insights and \ncritiques developed within statutory -interpretation theory  have shaken the \nfoundations of the most influential school of choice of law in the United States.  \nThis development is profoundly important. Multi -state disputes are set to \nmultiply as a deeply interconnected national (and international) economy confronts \na fractured political landscape, provoking confrontations over questions ranging \nfrom animal ethics25 to abortion.26 The methodology that courts use to resolve those \nmulti -state disputes can be outcome determinative \u2014the difference between, for \nexample, whether Nazi -looted art remains in a Spanish museum or is return ed to a \nJewish family in California.27 Or whether the victims of a terrorist attack have a \nviable tort claim against the foreign government that sponsored the group \n \n 23.

It then dives more deeply into the theory of governmental interest \nanalysis as first elaborated by Currie, focusing on the role played by legislative \npurpose in the interpretive enterprise. Part II examines the revolution in federal \nstatutory -interpretation theory  since Currie\u2019s time. This Part discusses the shift from \npurposivism to  textualism, focusing on the critiques of purposivism that underlay \nthe shift. Part III takes a critical look at Currie\u2019s approach to choice of law in light \nof the critiques of purposivism that have led federal courts to disavow a strongly \npurposivist appr oach to statutory interpretation.  \nPart IV explores how federal and state courts have adapted their choice -of-\nlaw approaches since the statutory interpretation revolution, with a particular focus \non presumptions against extraterritoriality. It first looks more closely at the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  express abandonment of a purposivist approach to determining the multi -\nstate applicability of federal statutes and its adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality in its place. This Part then examines the landscape in the state \ncourts to determi ne the extent to which the states have been following the purposivist \napproach proposed by Currie, focusing on the states that have departed from the \ntraditional approach of the First Restatement . Although the picture is messy, we \nconclude that Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is still alive, in some form, among the \nstates.  \nFinally, Part V examines the approach of the draft Third Restatement  to the \nquestion of a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. As noted, while the draft Third \nRestatement  generally endorses Currie\u2019s view that choice of law is, at least in part, \na matter of interpreting the multi -state scope of the contending laws, in practice it \nrepresents a significant departure from Currie\u2019s theory. Both in its presumption of \nextraterritoriality and in the operation of its subject -specific choice -of-law rules, the \ndraft Third Restatement  appears destined to accelerate the shift away from Currie -\nstyle governmental interest analysis in the states.  \nI. CHOICE OF LAW AS STATUTORY INTERPRETATION , PRE- AND \nPOST-CURRIE  \nChoice -of-law issues arise when a dispute spans state boundaries. If \neverything occurred in one state and all of the parties are from that state, a court has \nno need to decide a choice -of-law question. The court decides the case according to \nthe law of the  only state having connections to the dispute. (We will call this the \npurely internal case.) A choice -of-law question arises only if the events giving rise \nto the dispute occurred in more than one state, or if the parties (or other interested \npersons) are affiliated with different states. (We will call this the multi -state case.)  \n \n 28. See John F. Coyle, Choice of Law in Terrorism Cases , 101 NOTRE DAME L. \nREV. (forthcoming 2026) (draft on file with authors).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  399 \nIn enacting statutes, legislatures will sometimes address the statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability by including what might be called an \u201cexternal scope provision.\u201d29 \nThe legislature might specify that the statute\u2019s substantive provisions apply to \npersons domiciled in the state, or to conduct that occurs in the state. When the \nlegislature has included such a provision in a statute, the question of the statute\u2019s \nmulti -state applicability is straightforwardly one of statutory interpretation \u2014it is a \nmatter of interpreting the external scope provision.30 Such provisions have \nhistorically been included in relatively few statutes, however.31 Even today, most \nstatutes lack such provisions. This Article focuses on how the courts decide the \nquestion of a law\u2019s multi -state applicability with respect to laws that do not include \nan external scope provision.  \nEven statutes that lack an external scope provision might be thought to have \na text relevant to the issue of multi -state applicability . Statutes are often phrased in \nbroad, all -encompassing terms. For example, \u00a7 33 of the Jones Act, addressing \n\u201crecovery for injury to or death of a seaman,\u201d originally extended to \u201cany seaman \nwho shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\u201d32 State statutes, \ntoo, typically extend broadly to \u201cany person.\u201d33 The courts, however, have uniformly \nrefused to read such statutes literally, reasoning that such literalism would produce \nunreasonable results. As explained by Justice Jackson in Lauritzen v. Larsen , if we \nread the Jones Act literally, we would conclude that \u201cCongress has extended our law \nand opened our courts to all alien seafaring men injured anywhere in the world in \nservice of watercraft of every foreign nation \u2014 a hand on a Chinese junk, never \noutside Chinese waters, would not be beyond its literal wording  . . . .\u201d34 In rejecting \na literal interpretation of such statutes, the courts \u2014both state and federal \u2014assume \nthat legislatures typically enact statutes with only the purely internal case in mind \nand d o not give any thought to the applicability of the statute to cases having foreign \nelements.35 Based on that assumption, the courts treat the issue of multi -state \napplicability as open to interpretation. In Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s words, the issue \nfor the courts in the face of such statutes is \u201ca problem of statutory construction \nrather commonplace in a federal system by which courts often have to decide \n \n 29. For an analysis of such provisions, see generally V\u00e1zquez, supra note 5.  \n 30.

The Supreme Court  of Alabama \u2019s decision in \nAlabama Great Southern Railroad v. Carroll is a good example.38 Alabama had \nenacted a statute repealing the common -law fellow -servant rule, but the legislature \nhad not addressed the statute\u2019s applicability to multi -state cases.39 The injury in the \ncase had occurred in Mississippi, and the Court decided that the traditional lex loci \ndelicti  rule called for application of the law of the place where  the injury occurred.40 \nThe Alabama statute was phrased in all -encompassing language, but the Court \nassumed that the legislature had not focused on the issue of multi -state applicability . \nIt held that the statute should be interpreted to extend only to cases in which the \ninjury occurred in Alabama. In the Court\u2019s words :  \nSection 2590 of the Code  . . . is to be interpreted in the light of \nuniversally recognized principles of private international or interstate \nlaw, as if its operation had been expressly limited to this State and as \nif its first line read as follows: \u201cWhen a personal injury is received in \nAlabama by a servant or employee, \u201d etc.41 \nIn this way, the state\u2019s general choice -of-law rule ( lex loci delicti ) implicitly \ncircumscribe d the general language of the statute. The legislature was presumed to \nhave instructed the Court to apply the substantive rule only to the extent it would be \napplicable under traditional choice -of-law rules. Traditional choice -of-law rules, in \nother words, functioned as a strong -form substantive canon of interpretation.42 \nThese traditional rules continued to prevail in the states until the mid -\ntwentieth century. Their defenders claimed (unconvincingly) that these rules were \ninherent in the nature of state sovereignty.43 Some courts understood them to be part \nof the general common law.44 The rules sometimes produced harsh and seemingly \n \n 36.

But this approach promised a measure of uniformity (meaning the \nresult would be the same regardless of where suit was brought), as well as certainty \nand predictability.  \nThe traditional approach was subjected to intense criticism beginning in \nthe 1930s, largely by legal realist scholars.45 These scholars criticized the harsh and \narbitrary results the traditional approach produced, and they debunked the notion \nthat these results were required by notions of state sovereignty.46 The Erie Railroad \nCo. v. Tompkins  decision and its progeny established that absent a federal rule , \nchoice of law was a matter of the positive law of each state.47 The state courts came \nto understand that how they approached choice of law was largely up to them, and \nmany decided to reject the traditional approach.  \nThe first fully formed alternative to the traditional approach was put \nforward in the scholarship of Brainerd Currie in the 1950s and early 1960s. His key \ninsight was that the answer to the choice -of-law question should be found in the \nsubstantive laws vyi ng for application. If the question was one of interpretation, as \neven traditionalist courts appeared to recognize, the answer should be found through \napplication of the ordinary methods of statutory interpretation.48 At the time Currie \nwas writing, the prevailing approach to statutory interpretation was the highly \npurposivist approach of the Legal Process School .49 Accordingly, Currie argued that \nin interpreting laws as to their multi -state applicability, the courts should apply an \napproach that interprets statutes \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d50 \nGiven the assumptions that courts make in their posing of the question, \nhowever, the task Currie had in mind was easier said than done. Recall that most \nstatutes do not include a provision addressing the law\u2019s multi -state applicability . As \nwe have seen, the relevant laws are typically written in all -encompassing terms \u2014\ne.g., \u201cevery person .\u201d The courts decline to read the laws literally on the assumption \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind and \nneglected entirely the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. The \n\u201clegislative purpose\u201d to which Currie referred could not have been the legislature\u2019s \npurpose with respect to the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability, as by hypothesis there \nwas no intent on that specific question.

The courts\u2019 task under Currie\u2019s framework was, \nthus, to interpret the statute on an issue that the legislature did not give any thought  \nto, much less memorialize in statutory text.  \nIn an early article,51 Currie illustrated his approach by examining a classic \nchoice -of-law decision from the 1890s, Milliken v. Pratt .52 Pratt was a married \nwoman from Maine who entered into a contract with Milliken, who was from \nMassachusetts.53 Under Massachusetts law, the contracts of married women were \nnot enforceable.54 Under Maine law, however, such contracts were enforceable.55 \nUnder the traditional approach to choice of law, the governing law was that of the \nplace where the contract was made, which in this case was Massachusetts. The Court \naccordingly held that the contract was not enforceable.56 \nCurrie argued that the Court should have framed the issue as whether the \nMassachusetts law invalidating such contracts, properly interpreted, was applicable \nto the contracts of married women from Maine.57 But the statute was silent on this \nquestion. The traditional approach assumed that the Massachusetts law reached all \ncontracts entered into in Massachusetts and no contracts entered into outside of \nMassachusetts.58 Currie argued that, as a reflection of the legislature\u2019s likely \npreferences, this construction of the statute was not defensible : the Massachusetts \nlegislature is unlikely to have wanted the multi -state applicability of the law it \nenacted to turn on the fortuity of where the contract was made.59 \nCurrie proposed an alternative way to interpret the Massachusetts law on \nthe question of its territorial applicability. At the time Currie was writing, the \ndominant approach to statutory interpretation counseled that a statute should be \ninterpreted to adva nce its purposes.60 Thus, Currie began by identifying the purpose \nof the Massachusetts statute. He concluded that the statute reflected the \nMassachusetts legislature\u2019s view that married women were a category needing \nspecial protection.61 Currie went on to ask: \u201c [Which ] married women [was it \nMassachusetts\u2019 s policy to protect]?\u201d His answer was: \u201cWhy, those with whose \nwelfare Massachusetts is concerned, of course \u2014i.e., Massachusetts married \nwomen.\u201d62 For this reason, he concluded, the statute, properly construed, extends to \nthe contracts of married women from Massachusetts , regardless of where the \n \n 51.

The Court in Milliken should therefore have held that the statute \nshould not be applied to invalidate the contracts of a married woman from Maine. \nIn other words, the statute should have been construed to reach the contracts of \nmarried women from Massachusetts entered into in M aine but not the contracts of \nmarried women from Maine entered into in Massachusetts.63 \nInterest analysis instructs courts first to interpret the laws contending for \napplication based on their purpose.64 This analysis might reveal that only one state\u2019s \nlaw, properly construed, applies to the case. In Milliken , for example, the \nMassachusetts law, properly construed, did not apply because the purpose of its law \nwas to protect Massachusetts married women, and the married woman in the case \nwas from Maine.65 If a similar analysis revealed that Maine law did apply to the case \nbecause its purposes would be advanced, the court should apply Maine law to the \ncase. This type of case is what has become known as a \u201cfalse conflict,\u201d66 and false \nconflicts are easy cases under Currie\u2019s analysis. Currie\u2019s identification of false \nconflicts was widely regarded as a breakthrough in choice -of-law theory.  \nIf both states\u2019 laws extend to the case, and the laws differ, the case presents \na \u201ctrue conflict.\u201d True conflicts are hard cases. Currie originally proposed that the \ncourt always apply forum law to resolve  true conflicts.67 Other scholars have \nproposed alternative approaches. We examine below some of the various approaches \nto resolving true conflicts. For present purposes, it suffices to note that according to \ngovernmental interest analysis, the threshold question in any cho ice-of-law \ninquiry \u2014and, for some theorists, the entire question \u2014is to determine the multi -state \napplicability of the laws contending for application. This question, according to \ngovernmental interest analysis, is an ordinary question of statutory interpret ation, \nand it is to be answered by identifying the law\u2019s purpose and asking whether that \npurpose would be advanced by applying it to the particular multi -state case before \nthe court.  \nBeginning in the early 1960s, many U.S. states rejected the traditional \napproach to choice of law and embraced versions of governmental interest analysis. \nAlthough a significant minority of U.S. states (about one -fifth of them) continue to \nadhere to the tr aditional approach, the rest apply one or more of the \u201cmodern\u201d \napproaches to choice of law,68 most of which find their roots in Currie\u2019s initial \n \n 63.

In Part III, we will look more closely at these and other aspects of Currie\u2019s \ntheory and evaluate Currie\u2019s approach, and those of his acolytes, in light of the \ncritiques that courts and scholars have since directed to the Legal Process approach \nto statutory interpretation. Before assessing the choice -of-law revolution \ninaugurated by Currie, however, we will examine the revolution that has taken place \nin the field of statutory interpretation since Currie\u2019s time.  \nII. THE EVOLUTION OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IN FEDERAL \nAND STATE COURTS  \nThe history of statutory interpretation in the United States is in many ways \na story of the fall of a certain type of purposivism. For several decades, the U.S. \nSupreme Court considered its primary mission in statutory interpretation to be \nuncovering the p urposes of the legislature, and the enacted statutory text was just \none of many aids to a statute\u2019s meaning. However, the textualist revolution that \nbegan in the 1980s \u2014which drew on critiques first made by the legal realists \u2014\nsubjected the assumptions upon which this type of purposivism rested to \nincreasingly strident critique. As a result, state and federal courts have mostly \nabandoned the notion that the specific will of a legislature can be ascertained in the \nabsence of clear statutory text.  \nThis Part briefly surveys the decline of old -school purposivism, setting the \nstage for our examination in Part III of how Currie -style interest analysis clings to \nan increasingly outdated method of interpreting statutes. It also demonstrates how \nthis histo ry has played out in state courts. The picture that emerges is one of \nasymmetry: even as state courts have mostly followed their federal brethren in \nrejecting purposivist methods of statutory interpretation, Part IV will show that those \nthat have imbibed C urrie\u2019s methods continue to apply his anachronistic interpretive \nmethods in the choice -of-law context.  \nA. Legislative Intent, Plain Meaning, and Purposive Statutory Interpretation in \nFederal Courts  \nStatutory interpretation has long wrestled with the question of legislative \nintent.69 Though debates continue,70 most have accepted the proposition that judges \nor others tasked with the interpretation of statutes ought to do so in order to best \neffectuate the will of the lawmakers.71 But to state that consensus is immediately to \nrefute it. What it means to \u201ceffectuate\u201d the \u201cwill\u201d of lawmakers , and which  \nlawmakers\u2019 wills matter, have been problems bedeviling statutory interpretation \nfrom the very beginning.  \n \n 69.

The \nbarrier this church faced was an 1885 federal law called the Alien Contract Labor \nLaw,72 which made it \u201cunlawful  . . . to prepay the transportation\u201d of a foreigner \u201cto \nperform labor or service of any kind in the United States.\u201d73 After the Holy Trinity \nChurch contracted to bring Mr. E. Walpole Warren to New York to serve as its rector \nand pastor, the United States brought suit, resulting in a case that eventually reached \nthe Supreme Court as Holy Trinity Church  v. United States .74 The question the Court \nconfronted was whether paying the transportation of a foreigner to come to the \nUnited States to serve as a pastor was proscribed by the Alien Contract Labor Law.75 \nJustice Brewer, writing for the Court, \u201cconceded\u201d at the outset of his opinion that \nthe church\u2019s action was \u201cwithin the letter\u201d of the law.76 But he argued \u2014in a now -\ninfamous line \u2014\u201cIt is a familiar rule[] that a thing may be within the letter of the \nstatute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the \nintention of its makers.\u201d77 The spirit of the Alien Contract Labor Law, according to \nJustice Brewer, did not reach \u201cany class [of workers] whose toil is that of the \nbrain,\u201d78 such as ministers.  \nJustice Scalia, in his Tanner Lectures , excoriated Holy Trinity  as \u201cnothing \nbut judicial lawmaking.\u201d79 Be that as it may, the opinion is notable for its breezy \ndeployment of the concept of legislative intent \u2014as gleaned from the circumstances \nof the bill\u2019s passage and indications in the legislative history \u2014to trump an \ninterpretation the Court readily admitt ed followed from the plain text of the statute. \nIt has been cited by Supreme Court opinions 67 times since 1885, including by \nJustice Brennan (approvingly) in his majority opinion upholding voluntary race -\nconscious affirmative action plans by employers in United Steelworkers of America \nv. Weber80 and, more  recently, by Justice Scalia (disapprovingly) in his dissent in \nZuni Public School District No. 89 v. Department of Education .81 \nThis emphasis on legislative intent came under sustained fire from legal \nrealists. Max Radin called the attempt to \u201cdiscover the intent of the legislator\u201d on a \ngiven question of interpretation a \u201ctransparent and absurd fiction.\u201d82 Radin argued \nthat the intentions of the \u201cseveral hundred men\u201d who voted for or against a bill are \nlikely so disparate that there exists no single attributable \u201cintent\u201d with respect to a \nlitigated issue.83 And even if that intent existed, Radin thought it likely to be difficult \n \n 72.

Hart and Albert M. Sacks \u2014the fathers \nof the movement \u2014famously instructed that courts \u201cshould assume, unless the \ncontrary unmistakably appears, that the legislature was made up of reasonable \npersons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably.\u201d95 The \u201ctask\u201d of interpreting, as \nthey saw it, started with deciding \u201cwhat purpose ought to be attributed to the statute\u201d \nand then \u201cinterpret[ing] the words of the statute immediately in question so as to \ncarry out the purpose as best it can.\u201d96 This highly purposive approach to statutory \ninterpretation was grounded in a political conviction that the legislative and \nadministrative organs of the state should be empowered to solve society\u2019s problems \nthrough lawmaking and that it was the institution al responsibility of the courts to \nassist that process.97 Thus, by 1940, the Supreme Court was again declaring that \n\u201ceven when the plain meaning [of a statute does] not produce absurd results but \nmerely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as \na whole\u2019 this Court has followe d that purpose, rather than the literal words.\u201d98 \nReplacing \u201cintent\u201d with \u201cpurpose\u201d does not clearly answer the theoretical \nobjections of Radin and his followers. Just as a statute may be passed by legislators \nwith multiple or indiscernible intents, a statute  may serve multiple or indiscernible \npurposes.99 More to the point, the realist critique was not that statutes have no \npurposes at all, but only that the text is the only reliable evidence of that purpose. \nAbsent relevant statutory text, speculation as to a legislature\u2019s purposes \u2014even \nthrough the use of  extrinsic aids, like legislative history \u2014runs into the same \nproblems that Radin identified. Nonetheless, the success of the Legal Process School \nwas evident: \u201c[P]urpose -based interpretation, often drawing liberally on legislative \nhistory, dominated decision -making\u201d during the Vinson and Warren Courts.100 \nAt the same time, a slightly more aggressive form of purposivism also \nfound converts. It came to be known as \u201cimaginative reconstruction.\u201d101 As Posner \ndescribed it, this approach required that the interpreter of the statute \u201ctry to think his \nway as best he can into the minds of the enacting legislators and imagine how they \nwould have wanted the statute applied to the case at bar.\u201d102 Perhaps the best -known \nexponent of this approach was Judge Learned Hand : \u201cAccording to Hand, the judge \nshould ask what the legislature would have decided if the issue had occurred to the \nlegislators at the time of enactment.

Old Textualism, New Textualism, and the Death of Classic Purposivism in the \nFederal Courts  \nClassic purposivism and \u201cimaginative reconstruction\u201d have for some time \nnow represented a controversial approach to statutory interpretation. Indeed, classic \npurposivism\u2019s emphasis on determining legislative intent or purpose from extrinsic \nsources coexist ed somewhat uncomfortably with an equally accepted early maxim \nof statutory interpretation: the plain -meaning rule. This protean form of textualism \nexhorted interpreters to follow the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s written terms \nwherever possible.106 As the Supreme Court phrased it, \u201c [W]here the language of an \nenactment is clear and construction according to its terms does not lead to absurd or \nimpractical consequences, the words employed are to be taken as the final \nexpression of the meaning intended.\u201d107 \nOne contemporaneous scholar observed that the \u201cmain effect\u201d of the plain -\nmeaning rule was to bar \u201cresort to otherwise admissible extrinsic \naids . . . evidencing the meaning or purpose of the enacting legislators,\u201d108 such as \ncommittee reports \u2014precisely the sort of materials that the search for legislative \nintent would require. The Supreme Court struck a compromise by permitting resort \nto such material \u201conly where [the] meaning is doubtful,\u201d109 implying that the plain -\nmeaning rule itself was simply a reliable method of determining legislative intent.110 \nIn this way, the plain -meaning rule and Holy Trinity -style purposivism can be seen \nas accepting the same baseline premise, despite the tension between their methods. \nThat premise is that statutory interpretation is a question of determining legislative \nintent.  \n \n 103.

William N. \nEskridge  Jr., Abbe R. Gluck, and Victoria F. Nourse have characterized the Burger \nCourt as a ready deployer of the \u201csoft\u201d plain -meaning rule, which \u201cfocused on text \nbut attempted to justify harsh textual results by using legislative history and statutory \npurposes to back them up.\u201d114 \nBut even this limited resort to legislative materials was soon to come under \nfire. By the mid -1980s, a cohort of conservative judges and officials in the Reagan \nAdministration\u2019s Department of Justice thought the Court\u2019s approach insufficiently \ntextualist.115 Led by Judge Frank Easterbrook and Justice Antonin Scalia,116 these \n\u201cnew textualists\u201d117 argued that the prevailing interpretive paradigm relied on an \nincoherent notion of legislative intent, drew on unreliable and manipulable sources \nof evidence to reconstruct that intent, and departed from the structural assumptions \nof the Constitution.118 As John F. Manning has written, the new textualists believed \nthat \u201clawmaking often entails compromise among interest groups with diverse \ngoals,\u201d leaving the words of the enacted statute as the most reliable \u2014and potentially \nonly\u2014evidence of Congress\u2019s \u201cpur pose.\u201d119 As a practical matter, the clearest \ninterpretive shift inaugurated by the new textualists was a religious objection to any \nuse of legislative history.120 \nUnsurprisingly, textualist scholars and judges also rejected imaginative \nreconstruction. Manning noted that \u201cimaginative reconstruction of legislative intent \nreflects implausible assumptions about the smoothness and transparency of the \n \n 111.

There \nwill not be a single objective, and discretionary interpretation favors some members \nof the winning coalition over others.\u201d123 Both believe that imaginative \nreconstruction produces outcomes that reflect the judge\u2019s preferences rather than \nthat of the legislature. \u201cImaginative reconstruction, asking how an expired Congress \nwould have answered a question had the subject been presented .  . . is of course \nfantasy  . . . , since we can imagine any answer we want when we are inventing both \nquestion  and answer.\u201d 124 \nNon-textualists have been equally skeptical  of imaginative reconstruction . \nJudge Posner was initially a fan125 but came to view the approach more critically. \nHe came to realize that imaginative reconstruction \u201crequires an exceedingly difficult \ncounterfactual inquiry and in practice is likely to be a mask for decision according \nto contemporary policy preferences rather than according to anything that can be \ndescribed  . . . as the  . . . purposes of the people who enacted the statute.\u201d126 Eskridge \nand Frickey write similarly that imaginative reconstruction \u201cis indeterminate\u201d and \n\u201coften asks counterfactual questions of a long -departed legislature\u201d on issues that \nthe legislature did not anticipate.127 Additionally, \u201cthe theory rests upon the \nquestionable assumption that judges will be able to recreate the historical \nunderstanding of a previous legislature. Modern historiography suggests that a \npresent -day interpreter can never completely or accurately reconstruct past \nunderstandings.\u201d128 \nThe rejection of old -school purposivism and imaginative reconstruction \nand embrace of the statutory text quickly won converts.

While earlier textualist critiques drew on insights from \npublic -choice theory \u2014emphasizing the role of interest groups in shaping \nlegislation \u2014Scalia grounded his version of textualism on the \u201cdemocratic theory\u201d \nembedded in the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers; he rejected the notion that \n\u201claws mean whatever they ought to mean, and  that unelected judges decide what \nthat is.\u201d137 Any search for legislative intent compatible with \u201cdemocratic \ngovernment,\u201d Scalia argued, should be limited to \u201ca sort of \u2018objectified\u2019 intent \u2014the \nintent that a reasonable person would gather from the text of the law , placed \n \n 131.

The Roberts Court  \nUnder Chief Justice John Roberts, these trends have only accelerated.147 As \nhas often been observed,148 text-based interpretive techniques now reign mostly \nunchallenged over the pragmatic and purposive methods of the Warren Court. To be \nsure, the narrative of the rise of textualism and the fall of (a certain type of) \npurposivism masks a complex reality; and , as others have observed, textualism\u2019s so -\ncalled triumph may be greater in rhetoric than reality.149 But our focus here is less \non whether textualism in fact dominates statutory interpretation in state and federal \ncourts than on how far the current conversation on statutory interpretation is from \nthe high purposivism of Currie\u2019s era.  \nFor instance, the Court\u2019s methodological debate now focuses mostly on \ninternecine debates within a textualist universe. In Bostock v. Clayton County ,150 the \nCourt confronted whether Title VII\u2019s prohibition on sex -based discrimination in \nemployment reaches discrimination151 on the basis of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity.152 The Court held, 6 \u20133, that it does, generating three different opinions \u2014\nwith all writing justices professing to employ textualism. Justice Gorsuch, for the \nmajority, exemplified what Tara Leigh Grove has called \u201cformalistic textualism,\u201d \nwhich \u201cinstructs interpreters to carefully parse the statutory language, focusing on \nsemantic context and dow nplaying policy concerns or the practical (even \nmonumental) consequences of the case.\u201d153 Justice Alito wrote a scathing dissent, \njoined by Justice Thomas, where  he accused the majority of writing an opinion \u201clike \na pirate ship\u201d that \u201csails under a textualist flag\u201d while embracing an atextual and \ndynamic form of statutory interpretation.154 Alito \u2014and Justice Kavanaugh in a \nseparate, more measured dissent \u2014exemplified a \u201cflexible textualism\u201d (to again \nborrow Grove\u2019s terms), which took under consideration \u201cpolicy and social context \n \n 147. This is not to say that some form of purposivism has not lived on at the Court, \nthough often unacknowledged as such. See generally Anita S. Krishnakumar, Backdoor \nPurposivism , 69 DUKE L.J. 1275 (2020) (making this case). As Krishnakumar writes, \u201cthe \nCourt, and its textualist Justices in particular, regularly employ pragmatic reasoning as well \nas supposedly neutral textualist tools to divine \u2014or manufacture \u2014congressional purpose and \nintent. \u201d Id. at 1279. Yet Krishnakumar admits, as we argue in Subsection  III.C.2, that \n\u201calthough classic purposivism is often characterized as directing courts to privilege the spirit \nover the letter of the statute, modern purposivists regularly pay close attention to statutory \ntext.\u201d Id. at 1283.  \n 148.

Attempts to reconstruct \nthe actual intent of the legislators or to apply an imagined intent to a new factual \nscenario would contravene both the structural underpinnings of the U.S. \nConstitution and most state constitut ions and would utilize materials that ordinary \npeople cannot readily access . \nWhat this means is that under modern methods of statutory interpretation, \nstatutory silence  as to a particular subject matter \u2014say, the multi -state applicability \nof a statute \u2014cannot be filled with mere hypotheses about what the legislature would \nhave wanted. Such silence is, rather, exactly what it looks like: nothing at all. Absent \na statutory t ext that has passed the procedural hurdles and can be read by ordinary \ncitizens, interpretation cannot go further by speculating about the legislature\u2019s \nultimate pur poses. As will be discussed, various presumptions (or canons) can \noccasionally fill that void. But importantly, those presumptions operate as consistent \nbackground rules, operating to stabilize outcomes across cases \u2014and to alert the \nlegislature of the cons equences of their silence \u2014rather than to faithfully embody an \natextual legislative purpose.  \nPurposivism, too, has undergone a dramatic transformation. The death of \nclassic purposivism is such that even those who would not identify themselves as \ntextualists have \u201ccaught the new textualism bug.\u201d157 Indeed, Gluck has observed that \nthe idea that legislative history or imagined purpose can trump unambiguous text is \n\u201cdead.\u201d158 At the Supreme Court, the liberal justices \u2014who are most comfortable \nwith the purposivist label \u2014readily deploy the same text -centric interpretive \ntechniques as their conservative brethren.159 \nOf course, the use of textualism may at times be a pragmatic strategy to \nwin votes in close cases. But modern purposivists have also taken to heart many of \nthe criticisms leveled by textualists. Practiced irresponsibly, purposivism can be \narbitrary and und emocratic, permitting judges to abuse their authority by imposing \ntheir policy preferences on open -ended legislation.160 As Manning has observed, \ncontemporary purposivists have accepted the proposition that \u201cfidelity to legislative \n \n 155.

In \nshort, while purposivists retain their theoretical commitment to serving as the \nfaithful agents of a purposive legislative body, the Court as a whole \u201cnow takes  its \ncues directly from Congress about how and to what degree to take background \npurpose or policy into account.\u201d163 This focus on what Manning has called \n\u201cimplemental purpose\u201d (and not just the background public policy informing the \nstatute) has made purposivism self -consciously more text -focused.164 \nAt the same time, other textualists have argued that the modern \npurposivism of the Roberts Court still permits legislative purpose or pragmatic \nconsiderations to play a role in determining whether a statute is textually ambiguous \nand, if so, how to resolve  that ambiguity.165 That is one way of saying, of course, \nthat the narrative of the decline of classical purposivism at the Supreme Court is not \nstraightforward. For instance, while admitting that purposivism has evolved \nsignificantly in response to the textualist revolution , Professor  Anita S. \nKrishnakumar has carefully documented the ways in which purposivists at the Court \nhave continued to make appeals to legislative intent,166 while self -avowed textualists \nhave snuck in purposivism through \u201cbackdoor\u201d methodologies.167 (As we shall see \nin Part IV, the Court has done something like this in implementing its presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality.) Yet Krishnakumar has also observed that invocations of \npurpose or intent are often woven together \u201cwith more text -based tools \u201d168\u2014a \ntechnique conspicuously unavailable for many choice -of-law questions.

But it is important here to underscore what the Court is not doing. It is \nnot imagining what outcome the legislature would have wanted in a particular case , \nnor would it permit statutory silence  to be filled through unrestrained judicial \nspeculation on a legislature\u2019s purposes.171 Yet that is precisely the strategy that \nCurrie -style interest analysis envisions.  \nD. The View from the States  \nBefore evaluating how Currie\u2019s interest analysis stacks up next to modern \nstatutory interpretation, it is necessary to address one obvious lacuna  in the above \nnarrative: while the story told above is true enough for the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nvast majority of choice -of-law problems are confronted by state courts. An \nequally \u2014if not more \u2014relevant question is, then, to what extent has the \nabandonment of atextual legislative intent or purpose occurred for state courts \napplying state law ? \nThe first comprehensive survey of state statutory interpretation was \nGluck\u2019s 2010 article taking up the question.172 Gluck found that states have followed \nthe federal trend with a caveat, adopting what she calls \u201cmodified textualism\u201d \u2014a \nform of textualism that differs from its federal cousin only in that : (a) it permits \nrecourse to legislative history when text is ambiguous , and (b) it provides a clear \nhierarchy of sources of meaning (text first, followed by legislative history, followed \nby substantive canons).173 Though Gluck\u2019s analysis centers on five key states, her \npreliminary research revealed that many other states follow a similar text -centric \u2014\nyet pragmatic \u2014model of interpretation.174 The conclusions are necessarily general; \ncertain jurisdictions (notably New York and the District of Columbia) retain a more \neclectic and purposive approach to statutory interpretation.175 But Gluck notes that \nthe Connecticut Supreme Court reached a conclusion similar to hers when it tried to \nabandon the plain -meaning rule, conceding  that this move would \u201cput it in the \n\u2018minority\u2019 among state courts.\u201d176 \nMore recently, Austin Peters has made use of natural -language processing \nand machine -learning tools to code over 44,000 state  court opinions according to \n \n 170.

Nonetheless, the Connecticut Supreme \nCourt \u201chas been very reluctant to apply the overruling statute. \u201d Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  417 \nhow often they use tools associated with textualism.177 His findings are consonant \nwith Gluck\u2019s. In particular, he notes that \u201cthe use of textualism in state supreme \ncourt opinions has risen rapidly since 1980,\u201d with a particular emphasis on invoking \na statute\u2019s \u201cplain meaning.\u201d178 But the states are not uniform in rejecting atextual \nmethods of statutory interpretation. According to Peters, the \u201ctextualist intensity \nscore\u201d of the most textualist state (New Hampshire) is ten times that of the least \ntextualist state (Oregon).179 \nThough states have not followed the U.S. Supreme Court in complete \nlockstep, even the modified textualism that Gluck observed among  the states is \nnotable primarily for what it does not endorse. First, it permits recourse to material \noutside a statutory text only when that text is ambiguous \u2014not when it is entirely \nsilent. Second, even though the use of legislative history may be permitted to clear \nup ambiguity or to attempt to find the second -best source of legislative purpose, \nthere is no indication that st ate courts generally permit the invention  or presumption  \nof a legislature\u2019s purposes when both statutory text and other extrinsic sources of \nmeaning are silent. Rather, as Gluck indicates, if both text and legislative history fail \nto provide an answer, modified textualism resorts to the deployment of clear, \nconsistent canons of construction \u2014\u201cclassic\u201d textualism\u2019s preferred tools.180 That \nstate courts are generally more amenable to legislative history, while the U.S. \nSupreme Court relies more on canons, is thus somewhat beside the point for present \npurposes. No predominant method of statutory interpretation, state or federal, \npermits a court to invent a purpose on behalf of a silent legislature.  \nState courts have therefore mostly abandoned the pretension that they are \nqualified to fill in the blanks for a silent legislature, following belatedly in the wake \nof the interpretive revolution that has taken place in the federal courts.181 To be sure, \nout-and-out purposivism of the Legal Process variety is not entirely dead in the \nstates.182 Even so, when courts look for legislative intent outside the text of a statute, \nthey typically rely on other  texts \u2014for instance, legislative history \u2014as substitutes.183 \nOutside the context of choice of law, the imaginative reconstruction of a legislature\u2019s \nintent on a specific question \u2014e.g., whether a law should apply to a set of out -of-\nstate facts \u2014has become a relic of an earlier era of interpretation.  \n \n 177.

ASSESSING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS AS \nSTATUTORY INTERPRETATION  \nAs discussed in Part I, Currie\u2019s innovation was not to regard choice of law \nas a matter of statutory interpretation; it was to bring a particular approach to \nstatutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the high purposivism of the Legal \nProcess School. Given the centrality of purpose to governmental interest analysis, it \nis past time to consider how well governmental interest analysis holds up in the harsh \nlight that recent judicial and scholarly critiques have shone on purposivist techniques \nof statutor y interpretation.  \nAs discussed in Part I, choice -of-law analysis assumes that in the absence \nof specific evidence that the legislature addressed the question of a statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability, the legislature enacted the statute with the purely domestic case \nin mind and gave no thought to the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. \nGiven this assumption, it is clear that in the types of cases that concern us here, the \nlegislature had no views \u2014and hence no purpose \u2014on the specific question of the \nstatute\u2019s multi -state applicability.184 In placing legislative purpose front and center \nin the courts\u2019 analysis, therefore, Currie could only have been referring to the \nlegislature\u2019s purpose in the purely internal case . In Section III.A, we discuss some \nof the challenges a court faces in ascertaining a statute\u2019s purposes in that context.  \nIn Section III.B, we assume for argument\u2019s sake that courts can reliably \nidentify a statute\u2019s purposes in the purely internal case, and we consider what we \ntake to be Currie\u2019s key claim: that a statute\u2019s multi -state applicability can be derived, \nas a matter of interpreta tion, from the purposes the legislature sought to advance in \nthe purely internal case. Drawing upon the main insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism, we argue that the legislature\u2019s purposes in the purely internal case \ncannot straight forwardly support any particular inferences about the legislature\u2019s \nlikely preferences with respect to the question of the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability. Under the prevailing paradigm of statutory interpretation, then, \nCurrie\u2019s project must fail out of the sta rting gate. Subsequent scholarly \ndevelopments of Currie\u2019s theory have sought to alleviate some of the concerns we \ndiscuss in Section III.B, but we show in Section III.C that these improvements fail \nto salvage governmental interest analysis from t he perspective of Currie\u2019s \nmotivating justification for the technique: fidelity to the legislature\u2019s preferences.  \nA. Identifying a Law\u2019s Purposes in the Purely Domestic Case  \nCurrie argued that a court should interpret a law as to its multi -state \napplicability \u201cin order to effectuate the legislative purpose.\u201d185 Because in the cases \nthat concerned him , the legislature did not think about the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability, and hence had no purpose on that question, Currie must have been \n \n 184. As discussed in Part II, textualists and nontextualists disagree on the propriety \nof considering legislative history.  We will sidestep that debate by assuming that the legislative \nhistory is equally silent on the question of the statute \u2019s multi -state reach.  Like Currie, we are \nprimarily interested in the claim that a statute \u2019s multi -state applicability can be derived from \nthe substantive  provisions of the statute even when the legislature has left that issue \nunaddressed.  \n 185.

Currie\u2019s approach thus rests on the view that a statute\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability can be derived from its purpose in the purely domestic case \u2014\nwhich we will call the law\u2019s \u201csubstantive\u201d purpose.  \nWe will consider in the next Section whether a law\u2019s purpose in the purely \ndomestic context can, by itself, yield any reliable conclusions regarding the \nlegislature\u2019s preferences on the question of the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. In this \nSection, we d iscuss some complications and uncertainties that arise in trying to \nidentify a law\u2019s purposes even in the purely domestic setting. These complications \nbear out the theoretical critiques of high purposivism discussed in Part II.  \nThe first difficulty is the contestability of attributing a particular purpose \nto the legislature. Consider Currie\u2019s conclusion regarding the purpose of the \nMassachusetts statute involved in Milliken . As discussed in Part I, this statute \nrendered the contracts of married women unenforceable. Currie concluded that the \nstatute reflected the Massachusetts legislature\u2019s view that married women were a \ncategory needing special protection, an understanding o f coverture laws that harkens \nback to Blackstone, who wro te that \u201cthe disabilities, which the wife lies under, are \nfor the most part intended for her protection and benefit.\u201d186 This conclusion is \ncontestable (to say the least). Far from \u201cprotecting\u201d married women, such laws had \nthe likely effect (and purpose) of maintaining married women in a subservient \nrelationship to their husbands.187 \nThe feminist critique of coverture laws is forceful and compelling, but \nCurrie might respond that his theory can easily withstand the critique. The critique\u2019s \nrevised understanding of the purpose of the Massachusetts law, he might argue, does \nnot require m uch of a modification of his proposed analysis. To the extent his \nanalysis focuses on the category of persons the law protects, one can simply \nsubstitute the married women\u2019s husbands  for the married women themselves as the \nbenefited part ies and proceed muc h as before.  \nPerhaps so, but another key insight of the textualist critique of purposivism \nis that a statute seldom, if ever, reflects a unitary purpose. Statutes are the outcome \nof a process in which numerous policies, many in conflict with each other, are \nconsidered and assessed by the legislature. The legislature weighs and balances \nthose policies, and the statute that emerges from this process is a compromise among \nthose policies.188 To describe the sole purpose of the Massachusetts law as the \nprotection of married women (or their husbands) is in tension with this insight.  \nCurrie did not completely overlook this point. He acknowledged that the \nMassachusetts legislature had taken into account not just the interests of married \n \n 186. 1 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE , COMMENTARIES  *430, *433.  \n 187.

The legislature\u2019s purpose in the purely internal case \u2014the purpose that \ndrives the court\u2019s interest analysis \u2014is the promotion of the policy that prevailed  in \nthe legislative battle.  \nBut the conclusion that the side seeking to protect married women (or their \nhusbands) prevailed is itself contestable. Imagine that some in the legislature wanted \nto protect married women by invalidating their contracts and imposing a fine on \nanyone attempting to enter into a contract with a married woman. Others believed \nthat doing so would infringe too much on freedom of contract and preferred to \ninvalidate the contracts of married women without imposing a fine. If the out come \nwas a law invalidating the c ontracts of married women but not imposing a fine, \nwould we say that the side seeking to protect freedom of contract prevailed? Again, \nthe point is that legislation reflects a particular balancing of contending interests, \nand the resolution of that conflic t does not tell us much about how the legislature \nwould have resolved matters not addressed in the statute.  \nOne might attempt to rescue Currie from this critique by pointing out that \nthe other state with connections to the dispute (Maine) had emancipated married \nwomen, recognizing the enforceability of their contracts. As compared to the law of \nMaine , one might legitimately concur with Currie\u2019s claim that the law of \nMassachusetts benefits married women (or their husbands). But notice that this \nargument seeks to ascertain the relative purpose of a law. If this is the analysis \ncontemplated by Currie, a law may have  one purpose when compared to the law of \nMaine but a different purpose when compared to the law of New Hampshire. For \nexample, assume that the law of New Hampshire not only renders the contracts of \nmarried women unenforceable but also imposes a fine on any one who attempts to \nenter into a contract with a married woman. Compared to New Hampshire\u2019s law, the \n\u201cpurpose\u201d of the Massachusetts statute would be to protect persons who would like \nto enter into contracts with married women. In sum, although t he law of a  given \nstate, considered in the abstract, cannot be said to have a general  purpose to protect \none set of persons or burden another set of persons except to the extent specified , it \nmight  plausibly be said to reflect a purpose of protecting a given group more than \nthe law of another state does.  \nIf this is how Currie would have courts identify a statute\u2019s purpose in the \nchoice -of-law context, however, his theory fails on its own terms. Currie presents \nhis theory as simply the application to the question of a law\u2019s multi -state \napplicability  of the same technique courts commonly apply to resolve issues of \n \n 189. See Currie, supra note 5 1, at 233.  \n 190. Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  421 \ninterpretation in purely domestic cases.191 But Currie\u2019s attribution to the \nMassachusetts legislature of a particular purpose to \u201cprotect\u201d or \u201cbenefit\u201d a \nparticular subclass of Massachusetts citizens rests ultimately on a comparison of the \ncontent of the Massachusetts law with the content of the la ws of the other states with \nconnections to the dispute. Far from extending to the multi -state case the same \nmethod that courts use to decide interpretive questions that arise in purely internal \ncases, Currie\u2019s approach to identifying a law\u2019s purpose is one  that, in fact, is specific \nto\u2014and can be applied only to \u2014multi -state cases. We can attribute a purpose to the \nlaw only in comparison to the laws of other states. The highly context -dependent \nnature of Currie\u2019s attribution of a purpose to a given law disti nguishes it \nfundamentally from the way a court identifies a law\u2019s purpose in \u201cmarginal domestic \nsituations.\u201d192 \nMaking matters worse, Currie unjustifiably assumes that all statutes reflect \nthe legislature\u2019s consequentialist weighing of the interests of contending domestic \ninterest groups \u2014an assumption  suggested by the very term \u201cinterest analysis.\u201d This \nassumption overlooks the possibility that a given law reflects commitments of a \nmore deontological character. The legislature may have adopted the rule based on \nnotions of natural law or natural justice,  or because it believed the rule to reflect the \nmost just solutio n to the problem it was addressing. Laws enacted on these grounds \ndo not lend themselves to Currie\u2019s approach to determining their multi -state \napplicability. If the legislature adopted a rule because, in its view, the rule reflects \nnatural law or natural j ustice, it may well prefer that the law be applied universally. \nIf the legislature were open to limiting the multi -state applicability of such a law, it \nwould presumably rest any such limits on considerations very different from the \nones that Currie would have had courts take into account: for instance, doubts about \nthe appropriateness of imposing its own notions of justice on societies with different \nvalues or circumstances, or a desire to reduce the interstate friction that would result \nfrom an aggressive  application of local values.193 As discussed in the next Section, \nthese are the types of considerations that Currie sought to banish from the choice -\nof-law calculus. Complicating the analysis, a given statute may reflect a combination \nof consequentialist and deontological purposes. Some  legislators may have favored \nthe rule that was ultimately adopted because it benefits certain of their constituents , \nand other legislators may have favored the rule because they considered it the most \njust rule.  \nB. Interpreting a Law as to Its Multi -State Applicability  \nLet\u2019s assume for argument\u2019s sake that courts are able to distinguish laws \nenacted for consequentialist reasons from laws that reflect the legislators\u2019 \n \n 191.

And let\u2019s assume further that it is possible to attribute \na purpose to a law by comparing it to the laws of other interested states ( in the face \nof Currie\u2019s claim to be simply applying to the multi -state case the same interpretive \nprinciples that courts apply to the purely internal case). Even overlooking these \nchallenges, Currie\u2019s purposivist approach is plagued by additional \u2014and in our view \ninsuper able\u2014problems. Currie assumes that courts may infer the legislature\u2019s \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability  from the purposes  it sought \nto advance in purely internal cases . In this Section , we show that even if the \nlegislature\u2019s substantive purpose can be reliably identified, no particular legislative \npreferences regarding multi -state applicability can be straightforwardly derived  \nfrom that purpose.  \nConsider again Currie\u2019s analysis of Milliken v. Meyer . As discussed above, \nCurrie concluded that the purpose of Massachusetts\u2019 s law rendering the contracts of \nmarried women unenforceable was to protect married women.194 What does that tell \nus about the Massachusetts legislature\u2019s preferences regarding the multi -state \napplicability of the law? To answer that question, Currie asked: \u201c What  married \nwomen [was it Massachusetts\u2019 s policy to protect]?\u201d His answer was: \u201cWhy, those \nwith whose welfare Massachusetts is concerned, of course \u2014i.e., Massachusetts \nmarried women.\u201d195 Because the statute was intended to benefit Massachusetts  \nmarried women, he concluded, the statute should be applied to all contracts of \nmarried women from Massachusetts and no contracts of married women from \nMaine.  \nBut even if we granted Currie his assumptions, we would not be able to \nconclude with any confidence that his analysis captures the legislature\u2019s likely \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. Currie assumed that the \npurpose of the Massac husetts legislature was to protect Massachusetts married \nwomen because these were the women \u201cwith whose welfare Massachusetts is \nconcerned.\u201d But it is more accurate to say (if we assume a provincial legislature, as \nCurrie does) that the Massachusetts legis lature is concerned with the welfare of \nMassachusetts citizens writ large, not just Massachusetts married women. As Currie \nhimself recognized, the Massachusetts statute reflects the legislature\u2019s balancing of \ncompeting interests. The legislature considered countervailing policies such as \n\u201cfreedom of contract,  . . . the security of commercial transactions, \n[and]  . . . vindicating the reasonable expectations of promises,\u201d and it subordinated \nthese policies to the policy of protecting married women.196 But our \u2014and his \u2014\nstarting assumption is that the legislature enacted the statute with only the purely \ndomestic case in mind. If so, all we can say is that the legislature subordinated the \ninterests of Massachusetts creditors in favor of the perceived need to protect \nMassachusetts married women only in the purely domestic context \u2014that is, in cases \nin which  everyone was from Massachusetts and everything took place there. By \nhypothesis, the legislature did not balance the relevant interests in the multi -state \ncase.  \n \n 194. See Currie, supra  note 51, at 234. \n 195. Id. \n 196. Id. at 233.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  423 \nIf the legislature had considered the multi -state case, it might have balanced \nthe interest in protecting married women and the interest in protecting freedom of \ncontract differently, even if it was only concerned with the welfare of Massachusetts  \ncitizens or residents . Its decision to subordinate the interest of creditors to those of \nmarried women in the purely domestic case may have been based on its assumption \nthat Bay Staters generally have no choice but to enter into contracts with other Bay \nStaters. B ut persons from other states have the option of doing business with Granite \nStaters or Down Easters instead. If the legislature had expanded its lens to include \nmulti -state cases, it might have been concerned that giving Massachusetts married \nwomen a right  to avoid contracts with out -of-staters might lead out -of-staters in \ngeneral to be hesitant to enter into contracts with Bay Staters \u2014even Bay Staters who \nare not married women.197 Out-of-staters might lose faith in Massachusetts\u2019 s general \ncommitment to enforcing contracts. Had the legislature considered the multi -state \ncase, it might have concluded that the cost to Massachusetts  citizens wishing to do \nbusiness with out -of-staters  of extending its coverture rule  to contracts made outside \nMassachusetts , when added to the general costs to Massachusetts citizens that the \nlegislature had weighed in the purely domestic case, tips the balance against \napplying the coverture rule to at least some multi -state cases. The legislature might \nwell have preferred to apply this policy of protecting married women only to \nMassachusetts married women entering into contracts with other  Massachusetts \ncitizens  or entering into contracts with anyone  in Massachusetts . It cannot be said \nthat a rational Massachusetts legislature would have necessarily decided to extend \nits law invalidating married women\u2019s contracts to all multi -state cases involving the \ncontracts of Massachusetts married women. A court cannot confidentl y predict that \nthe legislature would have balanced the competing interests the same way in the \nmulti -state case as in the purely internal case.198 \nCurrie\u2019s analysis also overlooks yet another key insight of modern statutory \ninterpretation scholarship: no statute seeks to advance a single purpose at all costs, \nand the legislature\u2019s choice of means reflects its views about how far any given \ngovernmental policy should be advanced at the expense of competing policies.199 \nSpecifically, Currie\u2019s approach fails to consider an entire category of costs that \nmight have led a legislature to limit the multi -state applicability of its internal law if \nit had thought about the issue. As noted, Currie took the position that a forum s tatute \nshould be construed to extend to a multi -state case whenever doing so would \nadvance the substantive governmental policy reflected in the statute, even if another \nstate also has an interest in applying its (different) law.200 This approach risks \n \n 197. Cf. Lilienthal  v. Kaufman , 395 P.2d 543, 549 ( Or. 1964)  (considering this \npossibility but mistakenly concluding that the legislature had already balanced the relevant \ninterests).  \n 198. This insight would not have altered Currie \u2019s proposed resolution of the \nMilliken  case itself, but it would have altered his proposed resolution of the converse case \u2014\none involving a contract made in Maine involving a Massachusetts married woman.

Greater i nterstate animosity is a cost of adopting Currie\u2019s policy of fully \nadvancing the interest in protecting Massachusetts married women. Averting such \nhostility is almost certain to be an additional interest  of the Massachusetts \nlegislature, as it risks a tit -for-tat that could disadvantage Massachusetts citizens. It \nis very possible that the legislature would have found the interest in protecting \nmarried women to be outweighed by the combined interests of Mas sachusetts \ncitizens in protect ing security of transactions plus avoiding interstate animosity.  \nCurrie was not blind to (all of) these critiques. He did consider the \npossibility that a Massachusetts legislature would weigh the domestically  relevant \ninterests differently in the multi -state context.201 He described this scenario as \nreflecting the possibility \u201cthat local policy is relatively weak, and suitable only for \nhome consumption.\u201d202 But he expressly rejected an approach that would have the \ncourts weigh the strength of the forum\u2019s policies against those of other states, and \nhe rejected reliance on systemic, multilateral considerations, such as the need to \navoid interstate friction or to avoid forum  shopping. He considered some of these \nvalues \u2014e.g., avoidance of forum shopping \u2014to be overrated, but he mainly \nbanished these values from the choice -of-law inquiry because he believed that it was \nnot a proper function of courts to pass judgment on the quality or strength of the \npolicies its legislature has enacted or to weigh those policies against those of other \nstates.203 For this reason, he argued that courts should play for the home team, so to \nspeak, and always apply forum law if doing so would advance the legislature\u2019s \npurpose in enacting the law.204 \nCurrie\u2019s reasons for banishing these considerations from the choice -of-law \nanalysis may or may not have been sound , but the result \u2014a single -minded focus on \nadvancing domestic purposes \u2014cannot in any meaningful sense be said to reflect the \nlegislature\u2019s likely preferences, if they could even be discerned. Currie\u2019s interest \nanalysis can therefore no more claim the mantle  of fidelity  to legislative preferences \nthan any number of other approaches, including the traditional approaches.205 He \nconceived of the choice -of-law issue as a matter of ordinary interpretation, and he \nurged courts to address the issue by \u201ctry[ing] to decide [the question] as it believes \n[the legislature] would have decided [it] had it foreseen the problem.\u201d206 He sold his \napproach as preferable to the traditional approach because, in his view, it was more \n \n 201.

The legislature might, in the end, have decided to provide for a broad multi -\nstate application of its substantive rule, as Currie favored, but it might not ha ve. \nInsofar as Cu rrie\u2019s approach categorically rules out consideration of these \nmultilateral  concerns, it cannot claim to reflect legislative preferences any more \nclosely than any number of other possible approaches to the interpretive issue.208 \nC. Multi lateral Approaches to Determining a Law\u2019s Multi -State Applicability  \nSome second -generation proponents of governmental interest analysis \nrefined Currie\u2019s approach in a way that seeks to alleviate this last criticism of his \ntheory. Currie argued for applying a forum state\u2019s law to any case in which  the \nlegislature\u2019s domestic purposes would be advanced, without regard to the existence \nor weight of the other states\u2019 interests, and without any consideration of interstate or \ninternational friction.209 This aggressive approach to the application of forum law \ndid not garner much support among courts and scholars. While like -minded courts \nand scholars generally viewed the identification of \u201cfalse conflicts\u201d as a huge \nadvance in choice -of-law thinking, som e sought an approach that considered multi -\nlateral considerations  in resolving true conflicts. These approaches refined \ngovernmental interest analysis by taking into account factors that Currie excluded \nfrom the calculus in the event of a \u201ctrue conflict.\u201d As techniques for ascertaining the \nlikely preferences of the legi slature with respect to the multi -state applicability of \nstatutes, they represent an advance over Currie\u2019s original approach. But the results \nthey produce cannot be said with much confidence to capture the actual preferences \nof the legislature regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability. In this Section, we \nconsider two such approaches.  \n1. Comparative Impairment  \nProfessor William Baxter proposed his \u201ccomparative impairment\u201d \napproach as a refinement of Currie\u2019s interest analysis.210 Baxter explicitly presented \nhis comparative -impairment approach as an attempt to discover the likely intent of \na legislature regarding whether to apply forum law in the face of a true conflict.211 \n \n 207. See, e.g. , BRAINERD CURRIE , SELECTED ESSAYS ON THE CONFLICT OF LAWS 727 \n(1963) (\u201cIt is explicitly an attempt to determine legislative purposes  . . . .\u201d); Brainerd Currie, \nThe Disinterested Third State , 28 LAW & CONTEMP .

For a forceful argument that Currie was not really ascertaining the legislature \u2019s \nreferences but was instead constructing them, see Lea Brilmayer, supra , note 23, at  399\u2013402. \n 209. See Currie, supra note 51, at 261 \u201362. \n 210. See William F. Baxter, Choice of Law and the Federal System , 16 STAN. L. \nREV. 1, 18 (1963).  \n 211. See id.  at 8\u20139. \n426 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nHe agreed with Currie that weighing conflicting substantive interests was not a \nproper role for the courts, but he thought that courts were  capable of determining \nthe extent to which the law\u2019s substantive policy would be impaired if not applied in \na given multi -state situation. He accordingly proposed that in true -conflict cases, the \ncourt should apply the law that would be most impaired if not applied. Widespread \nadoption of this approach to resolving  true conflicts, he argued, would maximize the \noverall a chievement of substantive state interests.212 The courts of California have \nadopted comparative impairment as their method of resolving true conflicts.213 \nBaxter\u2019s approach is more defensible as statutory interpretation than \nCurrie\u2019s, as it recognizes that the legislature would have been concerned about the \ncosts of an aggressive approach. But his analysis is applicable only in true -conflict \nsituations, and he adopts Currie\u2019s approach to identifying  true conflicts. Thus, \nBaxter\u2019s approach suffers from all of the problems outlined above concerning how \nthe court identifies a statute\u2019s substantive purpose s. \nMore importantly, even after identifying a true conflict, the comparative -\nimpairment approach carries over Currie\u2019s admonition to treat all policies as equal. \nBaxter expressly disavowed the weighing of policies.214 Like Currie, he defended \nthis constraint on the ground s that weighing conflicting state policies is not a proper \nrole for courts. Be that as it may, the fact remains that state legislatures do attach \ndifferent degrees of importance to their policies. By assuming that all states give \nequal weight to their policies, the comparative -impairment analysis fails to capture  \nthe likely preferences of the legislature concerning the statute\u2019s multi -state \napplicability . Thus, as an approach that seeks to ascertain and give effect to the likely \npreferences of the legislature, comparative impairment is almost as problematic as \nCurrie\u2019s approach. Currie and Baxter both missed that if they exclude from the \ncourts\u2019 consideration factors that the legislature would have considered had it \naddressed the question, their methods lose their claims to superiority as method s of \npredicting the likely preferences of the legislature.  \n2. The Second Restatement  \nAs applied by the California courts, if not as intended by Baxter, \ncomparative impairment resembles the approach of states that use the \u201cmost \nsignificant relationship\u201d test of the Restatement  (Second)  of Conflict of Laws  as a \nway to resolve true conflicts.215 The Second Restatement  combined elements of \n \n 212. See id.  at 18 \u201319. \n 213. See, e.g., Bernhard v. Harrah \u2019s Club, 546 P.2d 719 , 720 \u201321 (Cal. 1976) , \nsuperseded by statute , CAL. CIV. CODE \u00a7 1714 (20 11)). \n 214. See Baxter, supra note 210, at 13.  \n 215. The Second Restatement  does not explicitly set forth the \u201cmost significant \nrelationship \u201d test as a mechanism for resolving true conflicts.  Nevertheless, there is some \nbasis in the Second Restatement  for approaching the test in this manner, and some courts have \ndone so. See, e.g. , Phillips v. Gen . Motors Corp.,  995 P.2d 1002, 100 5 (Mont. 2000) ; see also  \nRESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b ( AM. L.

In \nexplicating and applying comparative impairment, the California courts have departed from \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  427 \ngovernmental interest analysis with consideration of expressly multilateral factors , \ngenerally calling for courts to apply the law of the state with the \u201cmost significant \nrelationship\u201d to the issue in question.216 It identifies a number of \u201cfactors\u201d and \n\u201cprinciples\u201d to be taken into account in determining which state has the most \nsignificant relationship.217 The approach has been criticized as highly indeterminate, \nleaving courts with largely unguided discretion. As some have derided it, the Second \nRestatement  instructs courts to take all the relevant facts and state policies into \naccount, giving those policies the weight they deserve in light of the purposes of the \ninterstate and international system.218 Despite (or, perhaps, because of) the wide \ndiscretion it affords to courts in the choice -of-law inquiry, the Second Restatement  \nhas proved to be popular among the courts. It is the most widely used choice -of-law \napproach in the United States today, having been adopted by roughly half of the \nstates.219 Some courts apply the Second Restatement \u2019s approach as if it were a form \nof interest analysis.220 Others apply the \u201cmost significant relationship test\u201d as a \nmechanism for resolving true conflicts.221 The Second Restatement  effectively asks \ncourts to replicate the process the legislature would have followed if it had addressed \nthe issue of the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability to the case at hand.  \nEven so, the results reached by courts in applying the Second Restatement  \ncannot confidently be said to reflect legislative preferences. Even more than Currie\u2019s \noriginal approach, the Second Restatement  effectively calls on the courts to engage \nin imaginative reconstruction, and we have already discussed the objections to this \napproach by textualists and modern -day purposivists alike. For questions left \nunaddressed by the legislature, it is impossible fo r a court to say how the legislature \nwould have weighe d and valued all of the relevant considerations outlined in the \nSecond Restatement . The legislature\u2019s all -things -considered approach to enacting \nstatutes could produce any number of possible outcomes. Without evidence as to \nhow the legislature would have resolved the issue \u2014and recall again that we are \nassuming that the legislature passe d the statute without giving thought to its multi -\nstate applicability \u2014it is impossible to predict how a reasonable legislature acting \nreasonably would have resolved it. Add t o this the well -founded doubts that \nlegislatures act reasonably, and we are left with the unfortunate but inescapable \nconclusion that the courts\u2019 attempt to reconstruct how the legislature would have \naddressed the issue of multi -state applicability , had it considered the matter , amounts \nto little more than conjecture. The conclusions reached by a court may well turn out \n \nBaxter\u2019s teachings and adopted an approach that resembles the Second Restatement  insofar \nas it seeks an \u201caccommodation of conflicting state policies\u201d  and tries to \u201callocate[] domains \nof lawmaking power in multi -state contexts.\u201d Harrah\u2019s Club , 546 P.2d at 723\u201324 (quoting \nHarold W.

But whether the court\u2019s ultimate conclusions are those the \nlegislature would have reached is unknowable.  \nEven if a court does fortuitously arrive at the same conclusion that the \nlegislature would have reached on the specific facts of the case, there is another \nproblem. Legislatures typically legislate for categories of cases, not for specific \nfactual situatio ns. As we have seen, however, Currie\u2019s approach to the multi -state \nissue is highly context -specific . It requires consideration of the domiciles of the \nspecific parties involved in the dispute and the location of the specific conduct (and \nthe effects of the  conduct) underlying the dispute.222 Even to specify the purpose of \nthe contending laws, as we have seen, the court has to consider the laws in \ncomparison with the laws of the other states having connections to the dispute.223 \nThe Second Restatement  approach is, if anything, even more context -specific. Thus, \nwhile a legislature typically balances various domestic interests in order to establish \na general rule or standard for courts to apply across a range of cases, Currie\u2019s \napproach and that of the Second Restatement  require courts to operate on the \nimplausible assumption that legislatures legislate for particular cases.  \nBy excluding consideration of multilateral  concerns, Currie\u2019s original \nproposal was more administrable by courts than some of the second -generation \napproaches to interest analysis and probably produced a greater degree of certainty \nand predictability. But in doing so, it sacrificed its claim to re flect the likely \npreferences of the legislature. The Second Restatement , consistent with its all -\nthings -considered approach, advises courts to take into account the need for \ncertainty and predictability as well as the needs of the interstate and international \nsystem (including judicial administrability). In taking these factors into account, a \ncourt could well decide that a more determinate general rule is preferable \u2014but it \ncannot claim with confidence that the legi slature would prefer a general rule or a \ncase-specific , indeterminate , all-things -considered analysis.  \n* * *  \nIn this Part, we have drawn on the modern critique of purposivism to show \nthat governmental interest analysis cannot claim to yield conclusions regarding a \nlaw\u2019s multi -state applicability that reliably reflect the legislature\u2019s preferences on \nthat question . We began with the usual challenges of identifying the legislature\u2019s \nsubstantive purposes in enacting a law \u2014its purposes in the purely internal case. \nThese difficulties can perhaps be overcome in a given case, but the task is rife with \npitfalls, and court s are as likely to err as to get it right.224 If a court accurately \nidentifies the purposes behind a law, interest analysis assumes that the legislature\u2019s \npreferences regarding the law\u2019s multi -state applicability can be inferred from its \nsubstantive purposes. But with respect to the type of law that inter ests us, we assume \nthat the legislature enacted the law with the purely internal case in mind, giving no \nthought to the question of multi -state scope. As we have shown, the legislature\u2019s \npurposes in the purely internal case are consistent with any number o f possible \n \n 222. See supra Section III.B.  \n 223. See supra  text accompanying note  191. \n 224. See supra Section III.A.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  429 \nlegislative preferences on the question of multi -state applicability . As a prediction \nof the legislature\u2019s likely preferences, i nterest analysis is thus not superior to other \npossible approaches to interpreting a law as to its multi -state applicability.225 \nTo be clear, we do not maintain that the modern critique of purposivism \nrules out any particular approach  to choice of law. Even if we understand the \nquestion as one of interpreting forum law as to its multi -state applicability (and we \ndo not question this view), a state is as free to adopt the case -specific , all-things -\nconsidered approach of the Second Restatement  as the traditional jurisdiction -\nselecting approach of the First Restatement . It is even free to adopt a Currie -style \ninterest analysis or Baxter\u2019s comparative -impairment approach. Our point is that \nnone of these approaches can claim the upper hand as being more faithful to \nlegislative preferences, as Currie purported to do. Whichever approach is adopted \nmust be defended on other grounds.  \nOne relevant consideration in selecting a choice -of-law approach will be \nthe need to avoid undue friction with other states having different policies while not \nunduly sacrificing the advancement of the substantive policies reflected in the \nforum\u2019s law. Thi s balance could be struck on a case -by-case basis, such as through \na Second Restatement -type approach. But another relevant consideration will be the \nneed for certainty and predictability, which would cut in favor of a broader rule, one \nthat will inevitabl y either over -protect the need to avoid friction with other states \nand under -protect the advancement of the forum\u2019s substantive policies or vice versa.  \nViews about the appropriateness of judicial policymaking will also affect \nthe choice of approach. Since the outcome of a court\u2019s application of a Second \nRestatement -type analysis cannot be attributed in any meaningful sense to the \nlegislature, an aversion to judicial policymaking might lead a court to adopt a \nbroader presumption of some sort (such as the jurisdiction -selecting rules of the \nFirst Restatement , or the presumption against extraterritoriality discussed below). \nOf course, the court\u2019s adoption of such a presumption would itself be an act of \njudicial policymaking, which requires justification. One potential justification is that \nsuch a rule creates a stable background against which Congress may act with \npredictable effects, thus maximizing the likel ihood that over time the outcomes will \napproximate those anticipated by the lawmaker. Of course, if the legislature does \nenact laws with background rules of interpretation in mind, faithfulness to legislative \npreferences might suggest keeping in place the currently existing  rules, which today \nwould favor retention of the Second Restatement  approach in about half of the states. \nBut the benefits of the existing rules would have to be balanced against their costs, \nincluding the difficulty of applying them and the randomness of the outcomes they \nproduce. Working through these factors and develo ping the best approach to choice \nof law is well beyond the scope of this Article. Our point is simply that as the modern \ncritique of purposivism in statutory interpretatio n has taught us, governmental \ninterest analysis cannot be said to be  superior to the other  approaches  from the \n \n 225. See supra Section III.B.  \n430 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nperspective of capturing legislative preferences with respect to mu lti-state \napplicability.226 \nIV. THE RISE OF INTERPRETIVE PRESUMPTIONS IN FEDERAL AND \nSTATE COURTS  \nThe insights of the modern critique of purposivism in statutory \ninterpretation have prompted divergent reactions in state and federal courts. The \nfederal courts, led by the U.S. Supreme Court, have adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality, which i nterprets federal statutes to not apply beyond our borders  \nunless the statutory text (or possibly other evidence of legislative intent) clearly \nreflects a contrary legislative intent. In theory, at least, this presumption appears to \nintegrate the Court\u2019s g eneral approach to statutory interpretation with its approach \nto choice of law. The states, meanwhile, have developed diverse approaches: some \nhave adopt ed a similar presumption ; others have  not; and few rationalize their \napproach to statutes and the common law. While the federal courts have expressly \nrejected Currie\u2019s teachings  in determining the multi -state applicability of federal \nstatutes , the state courts have been much slower to do so.  \nThis narrative masks some complexity. As we discuss below, the federal \npresumption against extraterritoriality  in practice  ends up reproducing elements of \nthe purposive analysis that it facially rejects. Even so, it is a far more constrained \npurposive inquiry, much closer to the modern purposivism we previously \ndiscussed227 than to an unbounded imaginative reconstruction of legislative intent. \nThus, even as some form of purposivism may well endure in federal choice of law, \nit differs radically from the version Currie espoused. Section IV.A discusses the \nCourt\u2019s adoption and implementation of a presumption against extraterritoriality, \nand Section IV.B discusses the state courts\u2019 response to the statutory interpretation \nrevolution.  \nA. The Federal Presumption Against Extraterritoriality  \nThe revolution in statutory interpretation described in Part II was led by the \nU.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Scalia taking a leading role. This revolution has \nhad a decided impact on the Court\u2019s approach to determining the multi -state \napplicability of f ederal statutes. The Court\u2019s adoption of the presumption against \nextraterritoriality was a classic textualist move, eschewing an inquiry into legislative \nintent in favor of a clear -cut, widely applicable rule of construction.228 The \n \n 226. Indeed, we doubt that governmental interest analysis can even reliably identify \nfalse conflicts \u2014that is, cases in which no purpose of a given state\u2019s law would be advanced \nif applied in the case. As discussed in Section III.A, if a legislature\u2019s enactment of a given \nlaw reflects its views that a  rule is more just, it may prefer that the rule be applied to all cases, \nno matter how unconnected to the forum.  \n 227. See supra Section II.C.  \n 228. See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER , READING LAW: THE \nINTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS  xxvii \u2013xxix (1st ed. 2012) (claiming that the canons of \nconstruction \u201cwill provide greater certainty in the law, and hence greater predictability and \ngreater respect for the rule of law \u201d). Whether the canons of construction constrain judicial \ndecision -making  is, of course, hotly debated. See, e.g. , WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE , JR., \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  431 \ndifficulties the Court has encountered in giving content to the presumption, however, \nillustrate the challenges of discarding all reference to legislative purpose.  \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s cases about the extraterritorial applicability of federal \nstatutes address the same issue that state courts are confronted with in choice -of-law \ncases: the multi -state applicability229 of forum (in this case, federal) law.230 This \nSection will focus on the Court\u2019s adoption and application of the presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality, which is its current approach to this question. But first , we \nwill briefly describe the Court\u2019s earlier practices, showing how its approaches to this \nquestion have generally followed developments in choice -of-law doctrine over the \nyears.  \n1. Extraterritoriality and Choice of Law  \nInitially, the U.S. Supreme Court applied something like the traditional \napproach to choice of law in construing federal statutes as to their multi -state \napplicability: in the absence of evidence of a contrary congressional intent, the Court \nconstrued statutes to apply only to the extent the forum\u2019s law would be applicable \nunder traditional choice -of-law rules. Thus, in reviewing the foreign applicability of \nthe Sherman Act, the Court wrote in American Banana  Co. v. United Fruit Co.  that \n\u201c[w]ords having uni versal scope, such as \u2018every contract in restraint of trade,\u2019 \u2018every \nperson who shall monopolize,\u2019 etc., will be taken, as a matter of course, to mean \nonly everyone subject to such legislation, not all that the legislator subsequently may \nbe able to catch. \u201d231 The Court looked to choice -of-law cases to determine who was \nproperly \u201csubject to such legislation,\u201d noting that \u201cthe general and almost universal \nrule is that the character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly \nby the law of the count ry where the act is done.\u201d232 Accordingly, the Court held that \nthe Sherman Act applied only if the challenged conduct occurred in the United \nStates.233 \nAs choice -of-law rules developed, so did the Court\u2019s approach to the \nextraterritoriality issue. In the antitrust context, the Court replaced the strict \nterritorial approach of American Banana  with something closer to Currie\u2019s interest \nanalysis. In the Alcoa  case, the Second Circuit, sitting as a court of last resort because \nthe Supreme Court lacked a quorum, reiterated that \u201cwe are not to read general \nwords, such as those in [the Sherman] Act, without regard to the limitations \ncustomarily observed by nation s upon the exercise of their powers; limitations which \n \nINTERPRETING LAW: A PRIMER ON HOW TO READ STATUTES AND THE CONSTITUTION  16\u201319 \n(2016). For present purposes, it suffices to note that such presumptions are driven by the \ntextualist critique of purposivism and imaginative reconstruction, as Justice Scalia \u2019s opinion \nin Morrison  makes clear. See infra notes 257\u201358 and accompanying text.  \n 229. In the context of federal law, a statute \u2019s \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d is its \napplicability to cases having contacts with other nations.  See supra  note 5.  \n 230.

Although \nAlcoa  was not a Supreme Court decision, it was quickly endorsed by the Court.236 \nReflecting further developments in the conflict of laws, the Ninth Circuit, \nin Timberlane  Lumber Co. v.  Bank of America , developed the once -influential \n\u201cjurisdictional rule of reason.\u201d237 Citing the Second Restatement , the court adopted \na multilateral  test for ascertaining the multi -state reach of the Sherman Act, \ninstructing courts to consider not just the existence of an effect on U.S. commerce \nbut also \u201cwhether the interests of, and links to, the United States \u2014including the \nmagnitude of the effect o n American foreign commerce \u2014are sufficiently strong, \nvis-\u00e0-vis those of other nations, to justify an assertion of extraterritorial \nauthority.\u201d238 This multilateral  approach to extraterritoriality recalled the approach \nadopted by Justice Jackson to determine the multi -state scope of the Jones Act,239 \nwhich , as later described by Justice Frankfurter, reflected \u201cdue recognition of our \nself-regarding respect for the interests of foreign nations,\u201d with \u201cthe controlling \nconsideration [being] the interacting interests of the United States and foreign \ncountries.\u201d240 \nAs these decisions show, even if the multi -state applicability of a statute is \nunderstood as a question of statutory interpretation, it can, in principle, be assessed \neither through a substantive statutory presumption, a unilateral interest analysis, or \na multilateral  interest analysis. Indeed, in Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California , \nthe Court\u2019s strongest textualist justice endorsed a version of Timberlane \u2019s \nmultilateral  approach to extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act , even  while \nemphasizi ng that the question before the Court was one of statutory interpretation.241 \nJustice Scalia dissent ed in Hartford Fire \u2014the majority\u2019s mangled analysis having \nbeen based on a misreading of the relevant Restatement  provision.242 In F.

Nor did it suggest that any \nparticular approach was required or precluded by the need to be faithful to \nCongress\u2019 s preferences. The choice was for the Court to make, and in later cases the \nCourt adopted the presumption against extraterritoriality as its general approach to \ndetermining the multi -state applicability of federal statutes (while grandfathering \nout the ant itrust laws).  \n2. The Presumption Against Extraterritoriality\u2019s Textualism  \nWith the advent of textualism, the Court reverted to something like Justice \nHolmes\u2019s original approach in American Banana . In EEOC v. Arab American Oil \nCo. (\u201cAramco \u201d), the Court applied the presumption against extraterritoriality to \ndetermine the multi -state applicability of federal anti -discrimination laws as if \nnothing had changed since American Banana .244 Like the traditional approach, and \nlike interest analysis, the presumption against extraterritoriality is a rule for \ninterpreting statutes as to their multi -state applicability. Insofar as it tells courts how \nto apply a statute in the multi -state context where the legislature has not addressed \nthe issue, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates precisely as traditional \nchoice -of-law rules were understood to operate in the Carroll  case, and as Currie \nunderstood interest analysis to work \u2014i.e., as a way to interpret the multi -state \napplicability of statutes in the face of legislative silence.  \nAs with state statutes, there will frequently be text in federal statutes that \nwill bear upon the statute\u2019s multi -state applicability. Just as some state statutes will \npurport to apply to \u201cany person,\u201d federal statutes will often be broadly phrased as to \ntheir applicability. Indeed, federal statutes will often have language that bears even \nmore relevance to the question of multi -state applicability. The Sherman Act, for \nexample, purports to apply to \u201c [e]very  contract [or] conspiracy, in restraint of \ntrade  or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations .\u201d245 As \ndiscussed above, courts routinely disregard statutory text that purports to extend a \nstatute to \u201cany person,\u201d presuming that the legislature passed the statute with only \nthe purely domestic case in mind.  \nFor the same reason, in applying the presumption against extraterritoriality, \nthe Court disregards statutory text providing that the statute applies to cases that \naffect \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce,\u201d presuming that this language was adopted \nto address Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to legislate over the subject matter.246 \nThe Court has thus held that language of this sort, and other \u201cboilerplate\u201d language, \nis insufficient to rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.247 As is true with \nchoice of law generally, the Court has explained that it \u201cpresume[s] [Congress] \u2018is \n \n 244. 499 U.S. 244, 248, 259 (1991) , superseded by statute , Civil Rights Act of \n1991, Pub.

In the context of the presumption against extraterritoriality, \nthis assumption does heavier lifting \u2014it serves to justify the Court\u2019s conclusion that \nthe statute does not apply beyond our borders.249 \nIn sum, like other approaches to choice of law, the presumption against \nextraterritoriality restricts the multi -state applicability of federal statutes not just in \nthe absence of text, but in the face of text  suggesting the contrary . In this respect, it \nis a strong -form substantive canon, designed primarily to protect the extra -textual \ninterest in guarding against \u201cunintended clashes between our laws and those of other \nnations which could result in inter national discord.\u201d250 Scholars and judges have \ndebated whether substantive canons are consistent with the tenets of textualism. For \nexample, Justice Barrett has asserted, in both her judicial and scholarly writings, that \nstrong -form substantive canons \u201care \u2018in significant tension with textualism\u2019 insofar \nas they instruct a court to adopt something other than the statute\u2019s most natural \nmeaning.\u201d251 On the other hand, Barrett recognizes that a statute\u2019s text must be read \nin context; that \u201ccontext includes common sense;\u201d and that , from the perspective of \ncommon sense, \u201cliteralism \u2014the antithesis of context -driven interpretation \u2014falls \nshort.\u201d252 Justice Barrett\u2019s argument that such canons can be understood as based on \ncontextual or \u201ccommon -sense\u201d readings of the text is echoed in the cases on the \npresumption against extraterritoriality, where the Court has described the \npresumption as based in pa rt on the \u201ccommonsense notion that Congress generally \nlegislates with domestic concerns in mind.\u201d253 Although some scholars have claimed \nthat this approach to substantive canons is actually a form of purposivism,254 we \nview the presumption as aligned with the commitments of textualists to the extent it \ndisavows an open -ended search for legislative purpose and seeks the simplification \nof the judicial task and a measure of certainty and predictability in judicial outco mes. \nAs we will see in the next S ubsection, however, the Court\u2019s application of the \npresumption against extraterritoriality  has not completely banished all reference to \nlegislative purposes.  \n \n 248.

The Presumption Against Extraterritoriality\u2019s Purposivism  \nThe Court has expressly contrasted the presumption against \nextraterritoriality with Currie\u2019s purposivist approach. In Morrison v. National \nAustralia Bank ,255 Justice Scalia\u2019s description of the lower courts\u2019 then -prevailing \napproach to determining the multi -state applicability of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities \nExchange Act reads like a direct rebuke of Currie and of imaginative reconstruction \nin general:  \nCommentators have criticized the unpredictable and inconsistent \napplication of \u00a7  10(b) to transnational cases.  . . . The criticisms seem \nto us justified. The results of judicial -speculation -made -law\u2014\ndivining what Congress would have wanted if it had thought of the \nsituation before the court \u2014demonstrate the wisdom of the \npresumption aga inst extraterritoriality.256 \nAs we shall see, however, the Court\u2019s approach is, in application, less distinct from \nCurrie\u2019s than Justice Scalia\u2019s quip suggests \u2014largely because of Justice Scalia\u2019s own \nadoption, in the same case, of a \u201cfocus\u201d test to determine the multi -state applicability \nof a statute in the face of insufficient legislative guidance on the question.  \nThe Court adopted the presumption against extraterritoriality  as a \n\u201cprinciple of interpretation\u201d that \u201cpreserv[es] a stable background against which \nCongress can legislate with predictable effects.\u201d257 As the Court described it, the \npresumption tells us that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an \nextraterritorial application, it has none.\u201d258 But\u2014as befits an ancient topic of \njurisprudence \u2014the question of multi -state applicability resists such easy \ndomestication. The Court\u2019s statement in Morrison  would be true if in the absence of \ncongressional guidance on the question of multi -state scope, the Court interpreted \nstatutes to apply only to cases having no connections to other countries. But such a \nrule would impose presumptive limits on the multi -state applicability of federal \nstatutes that would be intolerable in today\u2019s globally integrated economy. While \nmaintaining that in the face of congressional sile nce, federal statutes lack all \nextraterritorial force, the Court\u2019s clarification of the distinction between an \nextraterritorial application of a statute and a domestic application makes it clear that \n\u201cnon -extraterritorial\u201d statutes do apply to some multi -state cases.  \nMorrison  involved a claim under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934. The defendant had engaged in certain acts of fraud in the United States in \nconnection with the sale of securities outside the United States.259 The Court \nconcluded that the statutory language did not evince clearly enough a legislative \nintent to reach foreign securities fraud.260 The statute was therefore applicable only \ndomestically. But  because some of the fraud on which the suit was based took place \nin the United States, the Court had to address whether the case before it presented a \ndomestic application of the statute. Notably, the Court did not entertain the \n \n 255. 561 U.S. 247 (2010).  \n 256. Id. at 260 \u201361. \n 257. Id. at 255 , 261 . \n 258. Id. at 255.  \n 259. See i d. at 251 \u201352. \n 260.

If it had, the Court could have ruled against the plaintiffs \nbecause some  of the relevant conduct had occurred outside the United States. The \nCourt did not even discuss this possibility.261 \nInstead, the Court held that where the case involves some foreign and some \ndomestic connections, the case presents a domestic application of the statute if \nwhatever was the \u201cfocus\u201d of Congress\u2019s concern occurred in the United States.262 In \nenacting the  Securities  Exchange Act, the Court held that the focus of Congress\u2019s \nconcern was \u201cpur chases and sales of securities.\u201d263 Therefore, the Court concluded  \nthat \u201cit is . . . only transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and \ndomestic transactions in other securities, to which \u00a7  10(b) applies.\u201d264 Because \nCongress\u2019s focus in enacting the Act was not the prevention of fraud, the fact that \nsome of the fraud had taken place in the United States did not mean that the case \nbefore it was a domestic application of the statute.  \nIt is clear from the Court\u2019s analysis that the adjectives \u201cdomestic\u201d and \n\u201cextraterritorial\u201d are terms of art, not descriptive terms. A case might present an \n\u201cextraterritorial\u201d application of the statute even if it has some connections to the \nUnited States,  such as fraudulent acts that occurred in the United States. More \nimportantly, a case can present a \u201cdomestic\u201d application of the Act even if it has \nsome connections to other countries, such as fraudulent acts in other countries in \nconnection with the sale  of a security in the United States. The Court\u2019s analysis \nmakes clear that the latter case is a \u201cdomestic\u201d case falling within the scope of the \nSecurities Exchange Act. The terms \u201cextraterritorial\u201d and \u201cdomestic\u201d thus turn out \nto lack any inherent content. Instead, they are given content by the Court\u2019s \napplication of the \u201cfocus\u201d test, which labels as a \u201cdomestic application\u201d any case \nwhere the law may be permissibly applied.  \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s concept of \u201cfocus\u201d therefore reflects its approach to \nthe question we have been discussing throughout this Article: how to determine a \nlaw\u2019s multi -state applicability in the face of legislative silence on that question. The \nfirst step of the analysis (examining whether there is sufficient evidence of \nlegislative intent to rebut the presumption  against extraterritoriality ) is analogous to \nthe courts\u2019 resolution of the choice -of-law question when the legislature has \nincluded an external sc ope provision in the statute. The second step (the \u201cfocus\u201d \ninquiry) addresses the more difficult question \u2014which arises more frequently \u2014of \nhow the courts are to answer the question in the absence of legislative guidance.265 \n \n 261.

Since the courts reach the focus issue only if the legislature has provided \ninsufficient guidance on the question of multi -state scope, it would seem that the \u201cfocus \u201d of \nthe statute, in this context, has to be its focus in the purely domestic case, just as a law \u2019s \n \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  437 \nBut the Supreme Court\u2019s concept of \u201cfocus\u201d was undertheorized, to say the \nleast. In holding that the statute\u2019s focus was the sale of securities rather than \ncombatting fraud, the Court in Morrison  reasoned that \u201c [s]ection 10(b) does not \npunish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct \u2018in connection with the \npurchase and sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any \nsecurity not so registered.\u2019\u201d266 It is equally true , however,  that the statute does not \npenalize all purchases or sales of securities, but only purchases or sales of securities \ninvolving deceptive conduct.267 It is unclear why the statute\u2019s focus was one of the \nconditions the statute establishes for liability but not the other.  \nOther parts of the Court\u2019s analysis in Morrison  seem to associate a statute\u2019s \n\u201cfocus\u201d with its purpose. For example, the Court noted that \u201cpurchase -and-sale \ntransactions are the objects of the statute\u2019s solicitude,\u201d and that \u201cit is parties or \nprospective parties to those transactions that the statute s eeks to \u2018protect.\u2019\u201d268 The \ndifference between the statute\u2019s \u201cobject of  . . . solicitude\u201d and its purpose is elusive. \nThe identification of the \u201cparties\u201d the statute \u201cseeks to protect\u201d seems like an inquiry \ninto the statute\u2019s purpose. Indeed, the identification of the class of p ersons the statute \nseeks to protect calls to mind Currie\u2019s approach to identifying statutory purpose, as \ndiscussed in Part III.  \nSubsequent decisions also suggest that the Court understands a statute\u2019s \n\u201cfocus\u201d as its purpose. In WesternGeco LLC v. Ion Geophysical Corp ., for example, \nthe Court concluded that \u201cthe infringement is the focus of\u201d \u00a7 284 of the Patent Act \nbecause its \u201coverriding purpose \u201d is \u201cto \u2018affor[d] patent owners complete \ncompensation\u2019 for infringements.\u201d269 Thus, if the infringement occurred in the \nUnited States, the case involves a domestic application of the statute even if the \ninjury was suffered abroad. In rejecting the argument that the damages  were the \nfocus of the statute, the Court stated that \u201cfocus\u201d  \u201ccan turn on the \u2018conduct,\u2019 \n\u2018parties,\u2019 or interests that it regulates or protects\u201d270\u2014all, again, common \nwatchwords for purpose (particularly the reference to interests). Even more \nsuggestive was the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[h]ere, the damages themselves are \nmerely the means by which the statute achieves its end of remedying \ninfringements.\u201d271 The \u201cinfringement\u201d is the \u201cfocus,\u201d in other words, because it is \nthe \u201cend\u201d the statute seeks to achieve. \u201cEnd\u201d is, of course, a synonym for \u201cpurpose.\u201d  \nThe apparent association of a statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d with its \u201cpurpose\u201d in these \ncases is somewhat surprising. Morrison \u2019s author \u2014the source of the \u201cfocus\u201d test \u2014\nwas one of the fiercest critics of purposivism. Indeed, as noted, Morrison itself \n \n\u201cpurpose \u201d under Currie \u2019s analysis has to be its purpose in the purely domestic case.  In both \ncontexts, the court assumes that the legislature acted with only the purely domestic case in \nmind.  \n 266. Morrison , 561 U.S.  at 266.  \n 267.

Understanding \u201cfocus\u201d \nas \u201cpurpose\u201d also leaves the Court\u2019s test for determining the multi -state scope of \nfederal statutes vulnerable to one of the key textualist criticisms of purposivism: that \nstatutes do not have a unitary purpose. The Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cfocus \u201d test appears to \nrequire the lower courts to identify a single focus. The purpose of the Securities \nExchange Act was in part to regulate sales of securities, but it was also in part to \nregulate deceptive conduct.273 The Supreme Court chose the former as the statute\u2019s \nfocus without really explaining why the other was not. Yet the Court also failed to \nprovide a convincing alternative understanding of the concept of \u201cfocus\u201d that would \nclarify why one but not the other was the statut e\u2019s focus.  \nFinally, a purposive analysis also risks undermining the presumption\u2019s goal \nof providing a clear rule against which Congress can legislate with predictable \neffects. As we have seen, Currie -style purposivism can be highly indeterminate.274 \nThis was, indeed, Justice Alito\u2019s criticism of the majority\u2019s recent holding in \nYegiazaryan v. Smagin .275 In RJR Nabisco v. European Community , the Court had \nheld (dubiously276) that because of the presumption against extraterritoriality, the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201c RICO \u201d) authorizes private \nrecovery only for domestic injuries.277 In Smagin , the majority held that determining \nwhether an injury was domestic or foreign involved a \u201ccontextual  . . . inquiry\u201d and \nnoted that \u201cno set of factors can capture the relevant considerations for all cases.\u201d278 \nJustice Alito noted in dissent that the Court had, in prior cases, \u201cplaced a premium \non workability in our extraterritorial -application cases.\u201d279 He criticized the Smagin  \nmajority\u2019s highly \u201cnuanced\u201d approach, quoting Justice Scalia\u2019s criticism of the \napproach the Court had rejected in Morrison : \u201cThere is no more damning indictment \nof the [Second Circuit\u2019s] \u2018conduct\u2019 and \u2018effects\u2019 tests than the Second Circuit\u2019s own \ndeclaration that \u2018the presence or absence of any single factor which was considered \nsignificant in other cases  . . . is not necessa rily dispositive in future cases.\u2019\u201d280 \nJust a week later, in Abitron Austria GmbH v.

Justice Sotomayor, relying heavily on \nWesternGeco \u2019s language equating a statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d with its \u201cend,\u201d reasoned that \nthe Lanham Act\u2019s end is \u201cprotecting consumers from confusion \u201d and would have \nheld that application of the Act would be \u201cdomestic\u201d if the likely confusion would \noccur in the United States .283 Because the courts below did not apply that test, she \nwould have vacated and remanded for its application in the first instance.284 But this \ntime it was Justice Sotomayor who was in the m inority. The majority, in an opinion \nby Justice Alito, significantly revised the Court\u2019s approach to determining when a \ncase involves a domestic application of a statute.  \nThe majority quoted and purported to accept WesternGeco \u2019s statement that \n\u201c[t]he focus of a statute is \u2018the object of its solicitude,\u2019 which can include the conduct \nit \u2018seeks to \u201cregulate,\u201d \u2019 as well as the parties and interests it \u2018seeks to \u201cprotect\u201d \u2019 or \nvindicate.\u201d285 But the Court held that a statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d is only sometimes  \ndeterminative of whether a case involves a domestic application of the statute. \nQuoting language from some  prior cases, the Court held that what matters is the \n\u201cconduct relevant to the focus\u201d of the statute.286 The Court read this language as \nrequiring that the thing that has to occur in the United States for a case to involve a \ndomestic application of the statute is always conduct.287 In other words, even if the \nstatute\u2019s focus is \u201cpersons\u201d or \u201cinterests,\u201d as contemplated by WesternGeco , and \nthose persons or interests are in the United States, the case does not involve a \ndomestic application of the statute if the case did not involve any conduct  in the \nUnited States. Similarly, even if the effect  of the conduct is in the United States, as \nit admittedly was in Abitron  (because the confusion resulting from the infringement \nwould occur in the United States), the statute does not involve a domestic application \nof the statute if no conduct occurred in the United States.  \nAbitron  appears to significantly rewrite the case  law on when a case \ninvolves a domestic application of a statute. The holding is in substantial tension \nwith Justice Alito\u2019s own opinion for the Court in RJR Nabisco , where the Court held \nthat RICO involved a domestic application of the statute when the injury  occurred \nin the United States, regardless of where the conduct causing the injury occurred.288 \nWhile in earlier decisions the Court had stressed the importance of the \u201cfocus\u201d of \nthe statute in determining when a case involves a domestic application of a statute, \nit now appears that \u201cfocus\u201d is relevant in only some cases \u2014namely, cases that \ninvolve s ome conduct in the United States and some conduct outside the United \nStates (as in Morrison ). When the case involves conduct outside the United States \nand a connection to the United States other than conduct (such as the domicile of a \n \n 282. See id.  \n 283.

The quick succession of these two decisions suggests \nthat the Court has not fully worked out its approach to extraterritoriality. The Abitron  \napproach, if followed in later cases, would reduce the range of cases where  there \nmight be a need to identify the statute\u2019s purposes. (Within this range of cases, \nhowever, the uncertainties of determining the operative  purpose remain.) The \nCourt\u2019s emphasis on the  place of the conduct, irrespective of purpose, adds to the \npredictability of the test and strengthens the presumption\u2019s status as a strong -form \nsubstantive canon. At least to the extent the case involves no conduct in the United \nStates, the applicability of the statute would apparently not depend on the nature of \nthe substantive obligations the statute imposes.  \nHowever, by insisting that th e relevant connection be the conduct  that the \nsuit is based  on, the Court may have selected the wrong category of domestic \nconnection. The traditional choice -of-law rule for torts focused on the place of injury \nrather than the place of conduct.289 And the Court\u2019s rule may be too blunt \u2014\ntraditional choice -of-law rules calibrated the required type of connection with the \nforum to the type of statute involved (place of injury for statutes sounding in tort; \nsitus for statutes involving property; domicile  for statutes involving questions of \npersonal status). In future cases, the Court may well develop the law in that direction. \nIf so, it will have stumbled onto an approach to the question of multi -state \napplicability that mirrors the approach that prevaile d in the states before the advent \nof interest analysis, which in turn would mark a dramatic reversal from the \npurposivism it once embraced in this area. On the other hand, if the Court adheres \nto this \u201cconduct\u201d test, it will have adopted a strong -form subs tantive canon that \nsignificantly overprotects the interest in avoiding conflict with other nations.  \nEven if Abitron  turns out to be a one -off, and the approach of Morrison  and \nWesternGeco  continues to prevail, the Court\u2019s adoption of the presumption against \nextraterritoriality  would reflect a significant departure from an approach like \nCurrie\u2019s \u2014and from the pre -Morrison  approach to construing securities laws as to \ntheir multi -state applicability. Even though the pre -Abitron  cases on \u201cfocus\u201d \ndetermine whether a case is domestic or extraterritorial by reference to a concept \nthat might be understood as its p urpose, they apparently contemplate the \nidentification of a statute\u2019s purpose at a very high level of generality. Thus, Justice \nSotomayor described the \u201cend\u201d of the Lanham  Act as the avoidance of confusion.290 \nRather than licensing courts to imagine how broadly the legislature would have \nwanted the statute to be applied, the courts merely ask whether the contact identified \nby reference to the statute\u2019s generalized purpose took place within the United States . \nThe approach bears scant resemblance to the imaginative reconstruction that Currie \ncalled for and that Scalia ridiculed.

The Diversity of State Approaches  \nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court seems to have brought its approach to \nchoice of law increasingly in line with its textualist approach to statutory \ninterpretation, the states have only fitfully \u2014and inconsistently \u2014followed its lead. \nEven as some states have been more willing to follow the Court\u2019s lead in rejecting \nthe free -form purposivism of the mid -century, many have insulated their choice -of-\nlaw approaches from that transformation.  \nMost states seem to follow some version of Currie\u2019s interest analysis in \nresolving choice -of-law problems. In the most recent survey of the choice -of-law \nmethodologies used in the 51 jurisdictions of the United States, well over half of the \nstates use either interest analysis, the Second Restatement , or some combination of \nthe two to resolve choice -of-law problems in tort and contracts.291 As mentioned \npreviously, the Second Restatement  was influenced by Currie\u2019s work. It generally \nselects the law of the state having the most significant relationship to the issue, as \nmeasured by factors including the \u201crelevant policies of the forum\u201d and the \u201cthe \nrelevant policies of other interested stat es and the relative interests of those states in \nthe determination of the particular issue.\u201d292 Commentary on those factors reveals \nthat a deeply purposive approach is envisioned to ascertain what \u201cpolicies\u201d and \n\u201cinterests\u201d are at play.293 \nSuch old -school purposivist approaches to choice of law are in vogue even \nin states that have otherwise adopted textualist methods of statutory interpretation. \nTake Texas. A 1984 Texas case adopted the Second Restatement \u2019s approach with a \ndistinct interest -analysis flavor,294 an approach that persists to this day.295 But both \nof Texas\u2019s high courts (the Court of Criminal Appeals and the Supreme Court of \nTexas ) have adopted a modified form of textualism as the basic method of statutory \ninterpretation, even in the face of a legislative directive to more readily consider \nextrinsic sources of statutory meaning.296 No effort seems to have been made to \nexplain the discrepancy between Texas\u2019s general approach to statutory \ninterpretation and its choice -of-law methodology.  \nYet that observation does not tell the full story. Currently, as William S. \nDodge has demonstrated, at least 22 states have adopted presumptions against \nextraterritoriality when construing their own statutes.297 Such presumptions would \nseem to cut against the dominance of Currie -influenced approaches to choice of law, \nas they operate as (ostensibly) clear interpretive rules that can often determine the \nchoice -of-law question without resort to considering state pu rposes or interests.

Texas, for instance, has adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality.298 Thus, when it comes to statutes at least, Texas would seem to \nadopt a consistent methodological line, avoiding boundless inquiries into state \ninterests or purposes.  \nUnlike the federal courts, however, no state court appears to have applied \nthis presumption to common -law claims.299 When it comes to common -law claims, \ncourts may choose to engage in a state -interest or purpose -driven inquiry in order to \ndetermine extraterritorial application. (Texas, again, would be a ready example.) \nThere may be good reasons to separate the treatment  of statutes and the common  \nlaw in this way.300 But both the U.S. Supreme Court and Currie envisioned the same \nregime to apply to both.301 In addition, among  the states , the presumption appears to \nbe inconsistently applied or \u2014in some cases \u2014entirely overlooked.302 And there is \nno necessary correlation between the dominant choice -of-law approach in a given \nstate and the likelihood that it has adopted a presumption against \nextra territoriality.303 The two operate independently, remaining both practically and \ntheoretically unreconciled.  \nPortraying the state landscape with regard to the adoption of Currie\u2019s \ninsights thus requires consideration of several axes. One preliminary consideration \nis whether the state conceives of the choice -of-law analysis as a two -step process: \nthe determination  of the \u201cscope\u201d of a given law, followed (if necessary) by \napplication of rules of priority.304 Another consideration is the state\u2019s dominant \napproach to choice of law \u2014which, for over half of all states, involves some \nconsideration of state interests or the purpose of a given law.305 Then there are state \npresumptions against extraterritoriality in statutory cases. Finally, operating in the \nbackground, there is the state\u2019s approach to statutory interpretation generally, as \nmeasured against a purposivism -to-textualism axis.  \nOne might expect at least some of these axes to align. For instance, one \nmight anticipate that a state with a generally textualist methodology would favor \npresumptions against extraterritoriality (in lieu of open -ended purposive inquiries) \n \n 298.

Such consistency is not to be found, however. Instead, the cases reflect a \nwide variety of approaches \u2014reflecting differing combinations of the above. The \nrejection of Curr ie-style purposivism among  the states has been at best partial. \nCurrie\u2019s interest analysis and the methodological commitments that sustain it live \non in pockets throughout the country.  \nConsider California. One of the last states continuing to use pure interest \nanalysis \u2014at least in tort306\u2014California has also adopted a presumption against \nextraterritoriality.307 The presumption turns \u201csolely on the location of the \nconduct,\u201d308 much like the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s latest ruling in Abitron . This \ncombination means that where out -of-state conduct is addressed by both common -\nlaw tort and statute, only the tort action typically may be sustained. For instance, in \nBernhard v. Harrah\u2019s Club ,309 the California Supreme Court accepted that a \nCalifornia dram -shop act could not apply extraterritorially because it was a criminal \nstatute, and such statutes generally do not apply extraterritorially.310 Yet the Court \nengaged in a lengthy analysis of the relevant state interests to determine that the \nplaintiff could still sue under an extraterritorial application of California\u2019s \nnegligence law.311 More recently, the California Supreme Court has indicated that it \nfollows the two -step process in resolving conflicts between statutory provisions: \nfirst, it determines the geographic scope of the relevant statutes, and second, if \nnecessary, it resolves c onflicts between applicable statutes through its choice -of-law \nprinciples.312 When what is at issue is the extraterritorial application of a California \nstatute, the presumption against extraterritoriality comes into play at the first step , \nand often  that is where the analysis ends.313 If the statute does apply \nextraterritorially, or if the conduct occurred in California, the analysis centers on \nstep two, where interest analysis plays the dominant role.314 The presumption \nsometimes operates to cut off interest analysis before it can get off the ground \u2014but \nonly in the specific situation where the California courts are called upon to apply a \nstate statute in a multi -state case. Otherwise, a free -form inquiry into \u201cstate interest\u201d \nrules the day.  \nSome states follow a similar model \u2014the Second Restatement  or interest \nanalysis, coupled with a presumption against extraterritoriality for statutory cases \u2014\nbut without the formality of the two -step process. For instance, Iowa courts have \nadopted a presumption against extraterritoriality.315 The Iowa Supreme Court, in \nPowell v. Khodari -Intergreen  Co., limited the presumption to statutory cases, \nholding that ordinary choice -of-law principles \u2014which, in Iowa, means the Second \nRestatement \u2014determine whether tort or contract with connections to other states \n \n 306.

Rather, it simply applied the \npresumption against extraterritoriality to preclude application of the statute while \npermitting the extraterritorial application of state tort law through evaluation of state \ninterests.317 \nConversely, Michigan couples a presumption against extraterritoriality for \nstatutes with a similarly clear -cut lex fori  approach to resolving conflicts in tort \n(though the state has adopted the approach of the Second Restatement  for \ncontracts).318 That combination produces the seeming anomaly of regularly \npermitting extraterritorial application of the state\u2019s common law while presuming \nthat its statutes are cabined within its borders.319 \nAt least 17 states have declined to adopt a presumption against \nextra territoriality at all.320 In such states, out -and-out purposive reasoning to \ndetermine the extraterritorial reach of state statutes is still used. In Burnside v. \nSimpson Paper  Co.,321 for example, the Washington Supreme Court applied the \nstate\u2019s age -discrimination statute to  the employee of a Washington company who \nresided  in California. The Court observed that \u201climiting the statute\u2019s application to \nWashington inhabitants would effectively allow Washington employers to \ndiscriminate freely against non -Washington inhabitants, thus undermining the \nfundamental purpose of the act, deterring discrimi nation.\u201d322 After quoting \nextensively from Currie, the Court examined the purposes of the relevant state \npolicies, concluding that \u201c[i]t can hardly be said that California and Washington law \nare in conflict of purpose.\u201d323 It then examined and dismissed California\u2019s interest \nin administrative resolution of age -discrimination claims.324 The Washington \nSupreme Court thus engaged in a deeply purposive exercise to justify the \nextraterritorial application of its age -discrimination statute. Notably, however, that \nCourt\u2019s general approach to statutory interpretation is to seek the \u201cplain meaning\u201d \nof the statutory terms, including \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the language at issue, the \ncontext of the statute in which that provision is found, related provisions, and the \nstatutory scheme as a whole\u201d325\u2014and not to start with an expansive consideration \nof the relevant state policies at issue.  \nOther states without a presumption against extraterritoriality evaluate both \nstatutes and common law under the same choice -of-law analysis where state \ninterests and policies play a prominent role.

One clear lesson is that national \ndiversity in the approaches to choice of law extends in multiple directions. States \ndiffer from each other in their general approaches to statutory interpretation (despite \na clear trend to ward modified textualism), in their adoption of a presumption against \nextraterritoriality for statutes (as well as in their application of the presumption once \nadopted), and in their general choice -of-law methodology. While the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has moved  toward some version of methodological consistency \u2014adopting a \npresumption against extraterritoriality for both federal statutes and federal common \nlaw\u2014the states have not. And even as Currie\u2019s purposivist approach to statutory \ninterpretation and choice of law appears increasingly anachronistic, it limps on in \nvarious forms in most states.  \nNonetheless, that diversity should not obscure an equally important \nobservation: unbridled interest analysis is on the decline, even as Currie -style \npurposivism  lives on \u2014in some form \u2014in many states\u2019 non -statutory (and sometimes \nin their statutory) choice of law. Perhaps this is because states have implicitly \nrecognized the inconsistency between Currie\u2019s approach and their own rejection of \nthe purposivism upon which it rests.331 If so, then their rejection of purposivism  \nremains incomplete. As this Section has demonstrated, states often still weigh state \npolicies and interests in the absence of an operative statutory text, engaging in an \nanalysis that they otherwise eschew. This Currie -inspired approach endures even \nwhen states have adopted presumptio ns against extraterritoriality for their own \nstatutes.  \n \n 326. 988 N.E.2d 408 (Mass. 2013).  \n 327.

THE THIRD RESTATEMENT  AND THE FUTURE OF \nGOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  \nThe ALI\u2019s current project of elaborating  a Third Restatement of Conflict of \nLaws  may accelerate the decline of Currie -style interest analysis. The draft Third \nRestatement  endorses Currie\u2019s claim that choice of law is a matter of interpreting \nthe contending laws as to their multi -state applicability, but it conspicuously \ndeclines to endorse Currie\u2019s distinctive contribution to choice of law \u2014the \npurposivist approach he broug ht to bear on the interpretive question.332 Indeed, the \napproach the draft Third Restatement  proposes to this question is decidedly non -\npurposivist.  \nAccording to the draft Third Restatement , the choice -of-law inquiry \nconsists of two steps. The first requires determining the geographic scope of the \ncontending laws; the second requires, if necessary, appl ication of  rules of priority to \ndetermine which of the potentially relevant law s should be applied. According to the \ndraft Third Restatement , only the first step is about interpreting the contending laws \nas to their multi -state reach. Section V.A of this Article discusses the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s app roach to this step and shows that its departure from Currie\u2019s \npurposivism at this step is almost as stark as the Supreme Court\u2019s. Indeed, the draft \nThird Restatement  adopts a presumption that is similar in form, if not in content, to \nthe presumption against extraterritoriality the Supreme Court has adopted for federal \nstatutes: a presumption of extraterritoriality.  \nThe draft Third Restatement  denies that the second step of its proposed \nanalysis involves an interpretation of the relevant laws as to their multi -state reach. \nAt the second step, the courts should simply select \u201cone of several overlapping laws\u201d \nonce they have already been interpret ed to reach the facts of the case.333 In Section \nV.B, we dispute the draft Third Restatement \u2019s claim that only the first step of its \nanalysis is about interpreting the contending laws. We maintain that the second step \nis also a matter of interpretation of the substantive law. If we are correct about that, \nthen assessing the extent to which  the draft Third Restatement  departs from Currie\u2019s \npurposivism requires us to examine how it instructs courts to perform the second \nstep. We do so in Section V.C and show that step two of the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s analysis is also distinctly \u2014though less stark ly\u2014non-purposivist in \nits orientation. Thus, if widely followed, the draft Third Restatement  will hasten  the \ndecline of governmental interest analysis.  \nA. Step One: The Draft Third Restatement \u2019s Presumption of Extraterritoriality  \nAccording to the draft Third Restatement , the choice -of-law process, by its \nnature, consists of two \u201canalytically distinct\u201d steps:  \nFirst, it must be decided which states\u2019 laws are relevant, meaning that \nthey might be used to govern a particular issue. This is typically a \nmatter of discerning the scope of the various states\u2019 internal laws, i.e., \ndeciding to which people, in which place s, and under which \n \n 332. See infra  text accompanying note 3 42. \n 333. RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b  (AM. L. INST., \nTentative Draft No. 3, 2022) . \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  447 \ncircumstances, they extend rights or obligations. Second, if states\u2019 \ninternal laws overlap and conflict, it must be decided which law shall \nbe given priority .334 \nGiving credit to Currie, the draft Third Restatement  notes that the first \nstep\u2014determining the multi -state scope of a law \u2014is an ordinary issue of \ninterpretation.335 If two or more states\u2019 laws reach the case, and the laws differ \u2014in \nthe parlance of governmental interest analysis, if the case presents a true conflict \u2014\nthe courts proceed to the second step: selecting the applicable law. This step involves \napplication of \u201crules of priority.\u201d According to the draft Third Restatement , this \nsecond step, unlike the first, is not about interpreting the contending laws as to their \nmulti -state applicability.336 Since  the draft Third Restatement  regards only the first \nstep as being a matter of interpretation of the laws in question as to their multi -state \napplicability, we begin by assessing to what extent the draft Third Restatement \u2019s \napproach to this first question carries forward the interpretive approach championed \nby Currie. The answer is: not at all.  \nThe draft Third Restatement  draws several conclusions that in its view, \nfollow from the recognition that the judicial task at this step relates to the \ndetermination of the contending laws\u2019 multi -state reach. First, the courts must look \nto the law of the state whose law is in questio n. Therefore, if a state\u2019s law has an \nexternal scope provision rendering the law inapplicable to the case, then this \nprovision is binding on all courts.337 If the law does not extend to the case \u2014for \nexample, because the external scope provision specifies that the law reaches cases \nwhere  the conduct occurred in the state and the conduct in th e case at bar did not \noccur in the state \u2014the law is not \u201crelevant\u201d and may not be applied to the case.338 \nThe same conclusion would follow if the state\u2019s courts ha d adopted a presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality , and the presumption, as developed by the enacting state\u2019s \ncourts, renders the law inapplicable to the case at hand. In this case, the law is not \nrelevant , and again the forum courts may not apply it.339 If, based on this analysis, \nonly one state\u2019s law reaches the case at hand, then there is a false conflict, and the \ncourt should apply the only law that reaches the case.340 \nSo far, the analysis is consistent with Currie\u2019s approach. But how is the \nforum to interpret the contending laws as to their multi -state applicability in the \nabsence of a statutory scope provision or an authoritative judicial holding? \nRegarding the manner of interpretation, the draft Third Restatement  appears to have \ninternalized the modern critique of purposivism. It notably declines to endorse \nCurrie\u2019s approach to interpretation, noting that \u201c[t]he precise details of Professor \nCurrie\u2019s method of interpret ation, as well as his conclusions in particular cases, are \ncomplex and contested, and this Restatement makes no attempt to describe or follow \n \n 334.

In interpreting their own laws as to their multi -\nstate reach, courts following the draft Third Restatement  are to presume that the laws \napply to all conduct within the state\u2019s territory and to all persons domiciled in the \nstate. The presumption is the opposite of the federal presumption against \nextraterritoriality in content, but it is similar to that presumpt ion in form, as it can \nbe rebutted only through a textual directive in the statute. Its applicability does not \nturn on the content of the law or the legislature\u2019s purposes in enacting it. The draft \nThird Restatement \u2019s approach thus appears to reflect the lessons of the modern \ncritique of purposivism in statutory interpretation.  \n \n 341. Id. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. b.  \n 342.

Step Two, Part One: Priority as Interpretation  \nAs noted in Part I, for Currie, forum law would always be applied when, \nproperly interpreted, the law reache s the case before the court. But the draft Third \nRestatement , like the approaches to interest analysis discussed in Section III.D, \ncontemplates a second step in the analysis in the event the step -one analysis reveals \na true conflict. If more than one state\u2019s law extends to the case, the draft Third \nRestatement  contemplates the application of \u201crules of priority\u201d to determine which  \nstate\u2019s  law is to giv e way. But the draft Third Restatement  does not regard this \ninquiry as a matter of interpreting the contending substantive laws as to their multi -\nstate applicability. In the view of the draft Third Restatement , the first step exhausts \nthe interpretive exercise. Once having determined that two or more laws reach the \ncase at hand, the second step tells the courts what law to apply, if the laws differ.348 \nAs to this step, the forum\u2019s courts always apply the forum\u2019s  \u201crules of priority.\u201d Step \ntwo is an instruction to the forum\u2019s courts about what  law is to be prioritized.349 \nWe think the second step is better understood as also a matter of \ninterpreting the forum\u2019s substantive law. Here, it is important to disentangle two \nrelated but distinct claims made by the draft Third Restatement . The first has to do \nwith its claims about whether the first and second steps are about the respective state \nlaws\u2019 external reach. The draft Third Restatement  claims that the first step concerns \nthe spatial reach of the substantive laws in question, a question governed by the law \nof the state that enacted the law.350 It follows that  if the enacting state has a \npresumption against extraterritoriality, the forum must apply that presumption, and \nif the presumption leads to the conclusion that the substantive law does not reach \nthe case, the forum court may not apply the law. On the othe r hand, the draft Third \nRestatement  claims that step two is not about the substantive laws\u2019 spatial reach, but \nabout choosing between two (or more) laws that do reach the case.351 In answering \nthis question, the forum court applies the forum\u2019s  test\u2014its own rules of priority, \nwhich (on this view) are merely instructions to the forum\u2019s  courts (and only the \nforum\u2019s courts) about when to apply another state\u2019s law.352 The draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s claim that the first step is about the laws\u2019 spatial reach while the \nsecond step is not can be questioned.353 For instance, the first step could also be seen \nas an instruction to the forum\u2019s courts about when to apply  another state\u2019s law and \nwhen not to, and the second step can also be understood as being about the spatial \nreach of the forum\u2019s law.354 For purposes of our analysis, however, we shall accept \nthe draft Third Restatement \u2019s understanding that the first step is about spatial reach , \n \n 348.

If so, then by \nwhat authority do the forum state\u2019s courts decide to resolve the case under the law \nof another state having a different content? The answer must be that forum law \ncontains an implicit permission to forum courts not to apply forum substantive law \nif, under the forum\u2019s rules of priority, the other state\u2019s law deserves priority. In other \nwords, the forum courts\u2019 authority to do so is conferred by a permission found in the \nforum\u2019s substantive law itself .357 \nThis is, indeed, the analysis the draft Third Restatement  itself implicitly \nendorses. It does so in its analysis of how external scope provisions are to be \ninterpreted. The draft Third Restatement  makes clear that in the absence of a clear \nstatement to the contrary, an external scope provision specifying that a statute \nextends to a certain category of case \u2014say, cases where the conduct occurred in the \nstate\u2014does not require  application of the law to such cases. If the conduct did occur \nwithin the state, the statute is \u201crelevant\u201d to the case,358 meaning that if another state\u2019s \nlaw is also relevant to the case, the court must go on to determine which of the two \nlaws is to be given priority. The draft Third Restatement  thus presumes that such \n \n 355. As we noted at the outset, that is why we are using the term \u201cmulti -state \napplicability \u201d rather than \u201cmulti -state reach \u201d to describe the matter in question.  See V\u00e1zquez,  \nsupra  note 5 , at 1318 . The term \u201cmulti -state applicability \u201d refers broadly to the forum \u2019s \ndecision to apply a law (or not) whether  because it does (or does not) reach the case or because \nit reaches the case but should (or should not) be given priority.  Id. at 1336 n.217.  Our analysis \nin this Article does not turn on which way of understanding the question is the right one.  \n 356. Because we are assuming arguendo  that the choice -of-law rules the courts \napply at step two are merely instructions to the forum \u2019s courts, we do not consider here how \nthe forum \u2019s courts should treat the step -two rules of other states.  If the step -two rules were \nregarded as a matter of the substantive laws \u2019 external reach , cf. supra  text accompanying note \n353\u2013354, it might be argued that the step -two rules of other states should be binding on \nforum \u2019s courts.  We do not pursue that question here.  Because we are accepting for purposes \nof analysis  the draft Third Restatement \u2019s claim that step-two rules are addressed solely to \nforum courts, we focus in this and the following Section on the step -two rules \u2019 status as \npresumptions for interpreting the forum \u2019s substantive law.  \n 357. In unusual cases, the forum \u2019s law will not reach the case , and the forum will \nhave to decide between  the laws of two other states that do reach the case. In such cases, the \nforum \u2019s rules of priority do not have to be understood as a permission found in the forum \u2019s \nsubstantive law; they can be understood instead as free -standing common law rules of the \nforum state.  See RESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF THE CONFLICT OF L. \u00a7 5.01 cmt. c (AM. L. INST., \nTentative Draft No. 3 , 2022) . In light of the draft Third Restatement \u2019s presumption of \nextraterritoriality, however, such cases should  be rare. In cases in which the forum \u2019s \nsubstantive law does apply \u2014which is the mine run of true -conflict cases \u2014the permission not \nto apply forum law and to apply another state \u2019s law instead is best understood as being \nimplicit in the substantive law itself.  Id. \n 358. See id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d  (\u201cRelevant laws are those that include the issue within \ntheir scope.\u201d).  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  451 \nprovisions permit the court, at step two, to decline to apply forum law , even to cases \nwhere the conduct occurred in the state, if the state\u2019s rules of priority dictate \napplication of another state\u2019s law. In other words, when an external scope provision \nspecifies that the forum\u2019s law does extend to the case, the provision is presumed not \nto mandate application of forum law .359 But if the external scope provision goes \nfurther and specifies that the forum\u2019s law must  be applied to cases within the law\u2019s \nspecified scope, the forum\u2019s courts must apply the law even if another state\u2019s law \nwould be applicable under the forum\u2019s general rules of priority.360 This means that \nthe forum\u2019s authority to apply the forum\u2019s rules of priority comes from the \nsubstantive law itself. The draft Third Restatement  not only (implicitly) recognizes \nthat the forum court\u2019s freedom to apply rules of priority is a matter of interpreting \nthe forum\u2019s substantive law, it appears to adopt an interpretive presumption: only a \nsubstantive law that \u201cdirects\u201d application of forum  law forecloses application of the \nforum state\u2019s rules of priority.361 At bottom, therefore, the forum court\u2019s authority \nnot to apply forum law in the face of an external scope provision specifying that \nforum law reaches the case comes from the forum\u2019s substantive law, as interpreted \npursuant to the presumptions set forth in the draft Third Restatement . Forum law is, \naccording to the  logic of the draft Third Restatement , presumed to contain an \nimplicit permission to decline to apply forum law if the forum\u2019s rules of priority so \ndictate.  \nThe draft Third Restatement \u2019s rationale for the forum court\u2019s authority to \ndecline to apply forum law applies equally to cases where forum law does not \ncontain an external scope provision. For states that adopt the  draft Third \nRestatement , the multi -state reach of their laws will, in the absence of an external \nscope provision, be determined through a different presumption. As discussed in \nSection V.A, states that adopt the draft Third Restatement  will presume a broad \nmulti -state scope for their own statutes . If forum law, interpreted through this \npresumption, does extend to the case at step one, one must ask again, by what \nauthority does the forum court decline to apply this law and apply instead the \ndifferent law of another state? The answer to this questio n is the same as for cases \ninvolving an external scope provision: the authority to do so  is found in the \nsubstantive law itself. The presumption in favor of exterritoriality is qualified by an \n \n 359. See, e.g. , id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d ( \u201c[A] choice of law issue exists . . . [when] there are \nmaterial differences among relevant laws . . . .  If a choice -of-law issue exists, [courts must] \ndecide to which law it is most appropriate to give priority. \u201d).  \n 360. See, e.g. , id. \u00a7 5.02 cmt. d (\u201cIf a local statute directs the selection of a particular \nlaw, the court must follow that statute unless it is unconstitutional. \u201d). Although the draft Third \nRestatement  here may be referring to a general choice -of-law rule mandating application of a \nparticular state\u2019s law to particular types of cases, the same conclusion would appear to follow \nif an external scope provision mandat es application of the substantive law in question to \nparticular types of cases. Mandatory language in an external scope provision would rebut the \npresumption that the scope provision extends the reach of the statute to cases having particular \nconnections to the forum but does not mandate its application to such cases  and therefore does \nnot foreclose application of rules of priority .  \n 361. See id. \n452 ARIZONA LAW REVIEW  [VOL. 67: 391 \nadditional presumption \u2014a presumption allowing the nonapplication of forum law \nif rules of priority so dictate.362 \nIn sum, choice  of law is pervasively about the interpretation of the forum\u2019s \nsubstantive law on the subject matter of the dispute, and most of the work is done \nby presumptions. As we have shown, the various choice -of-law approaches differ as \nto how they interpret the forum\u2019s substantive laws as to their multi -state \napplicability. They do not differ in regarding the choice -of-law question as being a \nmatter of interpretation.  \nC. Step Two, Part Two: Ignoring State Interests, Selecting the Jurisdiction  \nIf we are right that even step two is about interpreting the forum\u2019s \nsubstantive laws as to their multi -state applicability, then we must look at the draft \nThird Restatement \u2019s step -two choice -of-law rules to determine the extent  to which  \nit carries forward or rejects Currie\u2019s legacy. We look in detail at the sections \naddressing choice of law in tort. Although the draft Third Restatement  is still being \ndeveloped, its current provisions for tort cases indicate that it does not contemplate \na choice -of-law approach that turns on the type of purposivist analysis that Currie \nchampioned. Rather, the draft Third Restatement  sets forth a set of jurisdiction -\nselecting rules that leave little room for judicial consideration of state purposes or \ninterest s in passing statutes or developing common -law rules governing  tort liability. \nThe only trace of Currie -style purposivism comes in the application of a narrow \nescape clause allowing the draft Third Restatement \u2019s presumptive rules to be \noverridden when application of a different state\u2019s law is \u201cmanifestly more \nappropriate.\u201d363 \nChapter six of the draft Third Restatement  provides rules for resolving \nconflicts in the application of tort law. It instructs that in the absence of a valid \nchoice -of-law agreement by the parties, \u201ca tort issue is governed by the law of the \nstate with the dominant interest in the issue.\u201d364 Lest that language suggest a Currie -\nstyle analysis, however, the draft Third Restatement  goes on to explain that the state \nwith a \u201cdominant interest\u201d will be determined by one of two sets of rules: either (1) \na tort - or issue -specific set of rules or (2) a set of rules applicable depending upon \nwhether \u201cthe issue in question relates to conduc t or to persons.\u201d365 The draft Third \n \n 362. If the forum \u2019s law on the matter is a common -law rule, the authority to decline \nto apply the rule even though the rule by hypothesis extends to the case must be found in an \ninterpretive presumption allowing for the nonapplication of forum common -law if rules of \npriority so dictate.  Of course, if the forum \u2019s law is a common law rule, the \u201clegislators \u201d are \nthe courts themselves.  But this does not alter the analysis.  Even for statutory cases, the \n\u201clegislators \u201d of the two presumptions (if the statute does not contain an external scope \nprovision) \u2014the presumption that the law extends broadly to all cases involving conduct in \nthe state and domiciliaries of the state acting abroad, and the presumption that the court  is \nauthorized not to apply the law if rules of priority so dictate \u2014are the courts as well.  \n 363.

Id. \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  453 \nRestatement  expressly instructs courts not to perform an interest analysis \nthemselves, as it has performed the analysis for them.366 \nThe first set currently provides jurisdiction -selecting rules for products -\nliability actions367 and awarding punitive damages.368 For our purposes, the details \nof the rules are not significant. What matters is what they don\u2019t  contemplate: a \ndetermination of the multi -state applicability of the relevant law through judicial \nexamination of the purposes behind a state\u2019s products -liability or punitive -damages \npolicies. Indeed, the content of the relevant rule appears to be  irrelevant. Instead, the \ndraft Third Restatement  selects the appropriate jurisdiction\u2019s law depending on a \nnumber of objective factors \u2014e.g., \u201cthe state where the product was delivered\u201d369 or \n\u201cthe place of conduct.\u201d370 \nOutside of these specific areas, the same picture emerges . Gone are the \npurposive inquiries prescribed by Currie and encouraged by the Second \nRestatement \u2019s \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test. In their place, we find rules that \noperate by selecting the relevant jurisdiction\u2019s law on the basis of some objective \nset of factors. The draft Third Restatement  first divides the universe of potentially \nrelevant issues or connecting factors into two groups: (a) \u201c [i]ssues relating to \nconduct,\u201d where  \u201cterritorial connecting factors such as the location of the conduct \nor injury are of primary importance\u201d;371 and (b) \u201c [i]ssues relating to persons,\u201d where  \n\u201cpersonal connecting factors such as the parties\u2019 domicile are of primary \nimportance.\u201d372 As the draft Third Restatement  notes, this division is a familiar one \nin choice of law, commonly referred to as the distinction between \u201cconduct \nregulation\u201d and \u201closs allocation.\u201d373 Conduct -regulating rules, as the Second \nRestatement  explains, were commonly thought to be designed \u201cto punish the \ntortfeasor and thus  to deter others,\u201d while loss -allocation rules were \u201cdesigned \nprimarily to compensate the victim.\u201d374 The draft Third Restatement  observes that \nthe Second Restatement  made this distinction \u201cas part of [its] analysis of state \npolicies and interests,\u201d and thus the distinction \u201cis present in, or at least consistent \nwith, any modern policy -based approach to choice of law.\u201d375 \nBut the draft Third Restatement \u2019s deployment of this distinction is notably \ndifferent. For instance, it first elaborates a set of \u201c [i]ssues relating to conduct,\u201d which \ninclude \u201cstandards of conduct or safety,\u201d \u201cprerequisites for liability,\u201d various duties \nor defenses, and the \u201cscope of liability,\u201d among others.376 For such issues, the draft \nThird Restatement  provides a set of jurisdiction -selecting rules to determine the \nappropriate law.

When the parties share a common domicile, \u201cthat state\u2019s law governs \nan issue relating to persons.\u201d380 Indeed, underlining the shift away from Currie, the \ndraft Third Restatement  explicitly notes that \u201cthe rule of this Section does not depend \non the claim that no other state has a contrary policy or interest.\u201d381 Rather, the rule \nis presented as \u201ca sensible and widely accepted resolution of this conflict.\u201d382 \nConversely, if the \u201crelevant parties are domiciled in states whose laws are in material \nconflict,\u201d but the \u201cconduct and injury occur in a single state,\u201d then \u201cthat state\u2019s law \ngoverns an issue relating to persons.\u201d383 (Recall that if conduct and injury occur in \ndifferent states, the law of the state of conduct governs issues relating both to persons \nand to conduct.384) Thus, for the range of issues that are considered \u201closs -allocation\u201d \nissues \u2014or issues relating to persons \u2014the draft Third Restatement  again provides a \nset of fairly comprehensive jurisdiction -selecting rules.  \nAs should be apparent, the vast majority of factual scenarios presented by \na tort action are covered by the draft Third Restatement \u2019s rules.385 Our point is not \n \n 377.

If the particular rule involved in a given case does not \nappear on the draft Third Restatement \u2019s list of rules deemed conduct -regulating or loss -\nallocati ng, the court would presumably have to apply a form of purposive analysis to \ndetermine if the rule falls into one category or the other, but this would seem to involve a \ngeneralized purposive analysis very different from the sort of imaginative reconstruction \ncontemplated by Currie.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  455 \nthat these rules are not sensible.  (Indeed, we are broadly supportive of the draft Third \nRestatement \u2019s shift away from Currie -style purposivism and towards more \ndeterminate rules.386) As the draft Third Restatement  notes in many places, the rules \nwere formulated as distillations of majority practices across many jurisdictions. Our \npoint is, rather, that the draft Third Restatement \u2019s articulation of jurisdiction -\nselecting rules to govern the mine run of tort actions has mostly foreclosed any \ninterest -based analysis that would otherwise have been conducted under the Second \nRestatement  or other Currie -inspired approaches to choice of law. Drafts of sections \naddressing property and contract issues reveal a similar approach.387 \nThere is one interesting caveat to this picture. The draft Third Restatement  \ncontains an escape hatch , permitting states to decline to use \u201c[t]he law selected by \nthe rules of this Restatement\u201d if \u201ca case presents exceptional and unaccounted -for \ncircumstances that make the use of a different state\u2019s law manifestly more \nappropriate.\u201d388 As an example of an \u201cunaccounted -for\u201d issue, the commentary to \nthis section suggests the connecting factor of a \u201cpre -existing relationship between \nthe parties\u201d to a tort action that is \u201cof overwhelming importance.\u201d389 This escape \nhatch from the otherwise highly prescriptive rules of the draft Third Restatement  \nsuggests the possibility of a continuing role for purposive \u2014or at least interest -\nbased \u2014analysis of state laws and policies. The illustrations in the section suggest \nthat such an analysis is contemplated.390 But the draft Third Restatement  cautions \nthat there is meant to be a \u201chigh bar\u201d for invocation of the exception.391 Thus, to the \nextent that the \u201cmanifestly more appropriate\u201d exception preserves any role for \nCurrie -style purposive analysis, it appears to be a small one.  \nWith the exception of that escape hatch, the subject -area-specific rules of \nthe draft Third Restatement  are meant to govern the choice of relevant state laws. \nThe draft Third Restatement  presents its rules as a working through of the relevant \nstate interests that \u201ccourts are currently reaching under labor -intensive multifactor \nbalancing tests.\u201d392 That is, the draft Third Restatement  is meant to be the finished \nproduct of a well -executed interest analysis. But  if that\u2019s so, what it has worked \nthrough seems very different from what Currie had in mind. The presumptive rules \napply to whole categories of cases without regard to the content or case -specific \npurposes of the relevant statutes or legal rules.

And as we\u2019ve \nseen, the rules of priority that the draft Third Restatement  recommends \u2014in the \nabsence of statutory or contractual specifications to the contrary \u2014leave little room \nat all for the purposive analysis that was central to Currie\u2019s resolution of these issues.  \nThe result is striking. The draft Third Restatement  has constructed a choice -\nof-law framework where  the selection of the appropriate state law is largely \ndetermined by a set of jurisdiction -selecting rules that apply regardless of the \npurposes or interests of the relevant states. Despite repeated hat  tips to Currie, the \ndraft Third Restatement  in practice largely turns its back on him. The only directly \nacknowledged influence of Currie in the draft Third Restatement  is the idea that \nchoice of law is a matter of interpretation \u2014an idea that, as we\u2019ve noted, long \npredates Currie. When it comes to Currie\u2019s central contribution \u2014the application of \na purposive method of interpretation to state laws and policies \u2014the draft Third \nRestatement  has replicated in form, if not in substance, the rejection that has already \ntaken place in the federal courts. If the draft Third Restat ement  is widely adopted by \nstates in the same manner that the Second Restatement  has been , it would hasten the \ndemise of governmental interest analysis,  Currie\u2019s central contribution to choice of \nlaw. \nCONCLUSION  \nOur aims in this Article have been both descriptive and normative. \nDescriptively, we have shown that choice of law has been conceived by adherents \nof both traditional and modern approaches as, at bottom, a matter of statutory \ninterpretation \u2014a matter of interpreting forum la w as to its multi -state applicability. \nThe innovation of the adherents of governmental interest analysis was to bring a \nparticular approach to statutory interpretation to bear on the matter: the highly \npurposive approach of the Legal Proc ess School. We have also described the \nrevolution that has taken place in statutory -interpretation theory , focusing on its \ncritique of purposivism. The Supreme Court that has led that revolution has also \ndeparted from the purposivist approach to determining the multi -state applicability \nof federal laws that prevailed earlier . The response of state courts has been murkier. \nBut the current draft of the Third Restatement  proposes an approach to choice of law \nthat mirrors in form the approach the Supreme Court has taken in the federal sphere. \nIf it is widely adopted by states, as its predecessor has been , the draft Third \nRestatement  can be expected to accelerate the decline of governmental interest \nanalysis.  \nNormatively, we have argued that the insights of the modern critique of \npurposivism deprive Curr ie-style interest analysis \u2014and related approaches, such as \nthe multi -factor, open -ended , all-things -considered balancing process of the Second \nRestatement \u2014of their claim to superiority from the perspective of legislative \nsupremacy. In the cases that mainly concern us, the legislature has given no thought \nto the multi -state applicability of the laws it enacts. The legislature\u2019s substantive \npurposes \u2014i.e., its  purpo ses in the purely internal case \u2014do not yield reliable \n \n 393. See supra  Section V.A.  \n2025] GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST ANALYSIS  457 \nconclusions regarding the legislature\u2019s preferences with respect to the law\u2019s multi -\nstate applicability. Any approach that claims reliably to implement those preferences \nis, we  have argued, premised on a series of misapprehensions.  \nThis is not to say that the modern critique of governmental interest analysis \nprecludes an approach resembling the one Curr ie proposed, or the one adopted by \nthe Second Restatement . It means that the state\u2019s courts (or their legislatures, if they \nenact general choice -of-law rules) must take responsibility for the adoption of \nwhichever approach they adopt . None is required by the need to be faithful to \nlegislative preferences. Judicial lawmaking \u2014in the form of the establishment of an \napproach that applies in the absence of legislative direction on the question of multi -\nstate applicability \u2014is inevitable, and the cour ts (or legislatures) must justify their \nchoice of interpretive rule.  \nA court could articulate one of an almost infinite variety of determinate \npresumptions for or against extraterritoriality, as both the U.S. Supreme Court and \nthe draft Third Restatement  have done. Or it could devise a test whereby the \napplicability of forum law for certain categories of cases would turn on whether the \nregulated party is from the state, and for other categories on whether particular acts \nor events happened in the state, a s traditional choice -of-law rules have generally \ndone. At the other ext reme, it could adopt a case - and context -specific , multi -factor, \nall-things -considered balancing test of the sort contemplated by the Second \nRestatement . Our critique of purposivism shows that the choice among these \napproaches will have to be justified based on considerations other than reflecting \nlegislative preferences, such as how well the test identifies the types of disputes that \nanother state has a greater claim to regulating while promoting an appropriate degree \nof certainty and predictability, among  many other considerations. This is not the \nplace to assess the costs and benefits of the various contending approaches. Our \nclaim is merely that these are the considerations on which  the choice should rest.  \nAlmost 70 years after the revolution Currie initiated, the field of choice of \nlaw appears poised for a counterrevolution  in light of the revolution that has \noccurred in the field of statutory interpretation .",

Back to Blog Blog Post Veterans take another battle to the U.S. Supreme Court October 14, 2024 | by Marcia Coyle More in Constitution Daily Blog Many of the nation\u2019s veterans have fought battles with the federal agency responsible for awarding benefits for their service-connected injuries and illnesses. This week, the veterans fight again, but in the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, their battles with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs often involved complaints about an unwieldy, lengthy, ultimately unfair, claims process that seemed to defeat the intention to create a non-adversarial, veteran-friendly system. Over time, Congress did respond to some veterans\u2019 complaints and lawsuits. One important change was Congress\u2019 creation in 1988 of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. That court is tasked with hearing veterans\u2019 appeals from allegedly erroneous decisions on their claims by the department\u2019s board of veterans appeals. The backstop to that court is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Joshua Bufkin, an Air Force veteran, and Norman Thornton, an Army veteran, separately sought disability benefits for service-connected, post-traumatic stress disorder. Their claims were denied by the board of veterans appeals and those decisions were subsequently affirmed by the Veterans Court. In Bufkin v. McDonough at the Supreme Court, the two veterans argue that the Veterans Court and the Federal Circuit has been misapplying a federal rule that is central to review of veterans\u2019 claims, \u201cbut its practical benefit to veterans is being eroded by the Federal Circuit\u2019s narrow reading of the scope and standard of review available to veterans at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims,\u201d according to an amicus brief by a group of lawyers who frequently represent veterans pro bono. For more than 100 years, veterans have been entitled to the benefit of the doubt on any close issue material to their eligibility for service-related benefits. When Congress created the Veterans Court in 1988, it wrote the benefit-of-the-doubt rule into the 1988 act. The rule states: \u201cw]hen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary [of Veterans Affairs] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\u201d In 2002, Congress added something like an exclamation point to the law, stating that in deciding every appeal, the Veterans Court \u201cshall review the record of proceedings and \u201cshall take due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt statute].\u201d This provision, according to legislative reports, was adopted to give \u201cfull force to the \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019 provision\u2019\u201d by empowering the Veterans Court to conduct more \u201csearching appellate review\u201d of department decisions. \u201cThe rule that the veteran, not the government, receives the benefit of the doubt in a close case is among the most fundamental and longstanding precepts in our veterans\u2019 benefits system,\u201d wrote Melanie Bostwick, who represents Bufkin and Thornton. \u201cThis standard of proof, unlike any other in civil or criminal litigation, reflects a core societal judgment that it is better to err on the side of providing benefits to those who sacrificed their own interests on behalf of the nation.\u201d Her clients have drawn supporting amicus briefs from Disabled American Veterans, Military-Veterans Advocacy, National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP), and the Federal Circuit Bar Association, whose members practice before the Federal Circuit and represent or facilitate pro bono counsel for veterans. Bufkin and Thornton argue that the Veterans Court is required to make an independent, non-deferential review of the evidence before the department to determine whether there were close issues on which the veteran should have received the benefit of the doubt. The Veterans Court, they contend, is not taking that hard, independent look. \u00a0It is only examining the underlying factual findings for deferential clear error \u2014 \u201csomething already required elsewhere in the veterans\u2019 review statute.\u201d The Federal Circuit has agreed with the Veterans Court that clear error review is all that is required. The Biden Administration counters that the Secretary\u2019s decision that the evidence on a material issue is not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d is itself a factual finding and so is subject only to review for clear errors. If a claimant challenges the board\u2019s weighing of the evidence on a material issue, and the Veterans Court concludes that the Secretary\u2019s approximate-balance determination is not clearly erroneous, the government contends, the court has taken \u201cdue account\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. The National Veterans Legal Services Program argues that the text and structure of the law indicate, the \u201ctake due account\u201d provision requires the Veterans Court to separately consider the Secretary\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, and that\u00a0 would improve outcomes for veterans and reduce delays in the benefits application and review process. \u201cCase backlogs have increased as remands from the Veterans Court congest the [Board of Veterans Appeals] docket, and veterans are forced to wait even longer for resolution\u201d wrote D. Shayon Ghosh for the NVLSP.\u00a0 \u201cIn short, veterans organizations like NVLSP have explained to Congress that the Veterans Court\u2019s toothless review of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule regularly resulted in misapplication of that rule and unnecessary remands that cost veterans valuable time.\u201d What is the proper standard of judicial review is a technical, even wonky, issue. And may not make for the most scintillating oral arguments. But, as the veterans\u2019 challenge here shows, the answer can be critical to the outcome of questions with often huge significance in someone\u2019s life. The justices will hear arguments on Oct. 16. You can tune in by going to https://www.supremecourt.gov and clicking on live audio.

COLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \nAFFAIRS \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \nNo. 23\u2013713. Argued October 16, 2024\u2014Decided March 5, 2025 \nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) applies a \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt \nrule\u201d that tips the scales in a veteran\u2019s favor when evidence regarding\nany issue material to a service-related disability claim is in \u201capproxi-\nmate balance.\u201d  38 U. S. C. \u00a75107(b) .  Petitioners are veterans who ap-\nplied for service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dis-\nability benefits and were dissatisfie d with the VA\u2019s resolution of their \nclaims.  Petitioner Joshua Bufkin claimed that his PTSD stemmed \nfrom his military service, but the VA found no clear link.  Petitioner \nNorman Thornton obtained servic e-connected PTSD disability bene -\nfits, but the VA denied his most recent request to increase his disabil -\nity rating. These adverse de terminations were reviewed de novo by\nthe Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, which rendered final decisions on be -\nhalf of the VA denying the claims.  Petitioners then challenged the ad-\nverse determinations before the U. S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court).  Under \u00a77261(a), the Veterans Court reviews \nlegal issues de novo  and factual issues for clear error.  And under \n\u00a77261(b)(1), the Veterans Court mu st \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s \napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Applying those standards, the Veterans Court affirmed the VA\u2019s adverse benefit determinations, finding that the Board\u2019s approximate-balance determinations were not \nclearly erroneous.  The petitioners then appealed to the Federal Cir-\ncuit, challenging the Veterans Co urt\u2019s legal interpretation of \n\u00a77261(b)(1), and arguing that the statutory command to \u201ctake due ac -\ncount\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires\nthe Veterans Court to review the entire record de novo and decide for \nitself whether the evidence is in approximate balance.  The Federal \nCircuit rejected this argument and affirmed. \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n  2 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nSyllabus \nHeld : The VA\u2019s determination that the evidence regarding a service-re -\nlated disability claim is in \u201capprox imate balance\u201d is a predominantly\nfactual determination reviewed only for clear error.  Pp. 8\u201317. \n(a) Under \u00a77261(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the Veterans Court must \u201ctake \ndue account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of  the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nThis requirement directs the Vetera ns Court to give appropriate at-\ntention to the VA\u2019s work.  The Veterans Court must review the VA\u2019s \napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule \u201c[i]n making the determi-\nnations under subsection (a).\u201d  \u00a77261(b)(1). Accordingly, the standards\nof review provided in subsection (a ) also govern the Veterans Court\u2019s \nreview of benefit-of-the-doubt i ssues.  Section 7261(b)(1) makes ex -\nplicit the Veterans Cour t\u2019s previously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s\napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set forth in subsection (a).   Pp. 8\u201310.\n(b) The appropriate standard of review for any given challenge de-\npends on whether the challenge is fa ctual or legal in nature.  The par-\nties contest whether a veteran\u2019s challenge to the VA\u2019s determination\nthat the evidence on a particular ma terial issue is not in approximate\nbalance involves a legal inquiry subject to de novo review, or a factual \nfinding, or at least a predominantly factual, mixed question of law and fact, subject to clear-error review.\nThe approximate-balance determinat ion involves two steps.  First, \nthe VA reviews each item of evidence  and assigns weight to it\u2014a fact-\nfinding inquiry reviewed only for clear error.  Second, the VA deter-\nmines whether the evidence is in approximate balance.  See \u00a75107(b). This second step includes both le gal and factual components: factual \nbecause it involves marshaling an d weighing evidence, and legal be-\ncause the \u201capproximate balance\u201d dete rmination involves whether the \nevidence satisfies a legal standard.  The VA\u2019s approximate-balance de-\ntermination is thus at most a mixed question.  And the appropriate\nstandard of review for a mixed question depends \u201con whether answer-\ning it entails primarily legal or factual work.\u201d U. S. Bank N. A.  v. Vil-\nlage at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U. S. 387, 396. \nReviewing a determination whet her record evidence is approxi-\nmately balanced is \u201cabout as factual sounding\u201d as any question gets. \nId., at 397. In Bufkin\u2019s case, the Board weighed medical opinions and\nfamily testimony to assess his PTSD claims.  Similarly, the Board in \nThornton\u2019s case analyzed symptom severity and medical evidence to \nassess his disability rating.  Both cases demonstrate that approximate-balance determinations require case-specific factual review warrant -\ning clear-error review.  Pp. 10\u201313. \n(c) Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, petition-\ners urge that by amending \u00a77261(b)(1) to include the modest phrase,\u201ctake due account,\u201d Congress imposed a new standard of review for \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nSyllabus \nchallenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of the-doubt rule.  But \nhad Congress intended to do so, it would have identified a standard, \njust as it did in \u00a77261(a).  Petitioners next argue that, even if \n\u00a77261(b)(1) incorporates \u00a77261(a)\u2019s standards of review, the VA\u2019s ap-proximate-balance determination is much like a court\u2019s probable-cause\ndetermination, which involves a mixe d-question inquiry that appellate\ncourts review de novo . Ornelas  v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 699.   \nTwo features distinguish the probable-cause determination from the\nVA\u2019s determination here.  First, probable cause is a constitutional \nstandard, creating a strong presum ption that determinations under \nthat standard are subject to de novo  review. By contrast, the approxi-\nmate-balance determination is a creat ure of statute, not the Constitu-\ntion.  Second, probable cause poses a question that requires substan -\ntial \u201clegal work,\u201d U. S. Bank, 583 U. S., at 398, but the VA\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinatio n lacks a comparable legal compo-\nnent. \nPetitioners contend that the Federal Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a77261(b)(1)\nrenders the provision superfluous.  While this Court\u2019s reading of \n\u00a77261(b)(1) might involve some redundancy, the canon against sur -\nplusage does not apply here because petitioners have not identified a \ncompeting interpretation that would avoid redundancy.

DOUGLAS A. \nCOLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \nAFFAIRS \nNORMAN F. THORNTON, PETITIONER v. DOUGLAS \nA. COLLINS, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \nAFFAIRS \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT \n[March 5, 2025]\n JUSTICE THOMAS  delivered the opinion of the Court. \nWhen evaluating a veteran\u2019s claim for service-related dis-\nability benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \napplies a unique standard of proof known as the \u201cbenefit-of-\nthe-doubt rule.\u201d This rule requires the VA to \u201cgive the ben-\nefit of the doubt to the claimant\u201d whenever \u201cthere is an ap -\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any \nissue material to the claim.  38 U. S. C. \u00a75107(b).  When reviewing the VA\u2019s benefits decisions, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court)\nmust \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. \u00a77261(b)(1).  The question before\nus is what the Veterans Court must do to comply with thatstatutory command.  We hold that the Veterans Court must \nreview the VA\u2019s application of the rule the same way it\nwould any other determination\u2014by reviewing legal issues \nde novo  and factual issues for clear error.  See \u00a77261(a). \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n 2 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nAnd, we hold that the VA\u2019s determination that the evidence \nis in approximate balance is a predominantly factual deter-\nmination reviewed only for clear error. \nI \nA \nCongress provides veterans a wide range of benefits, in-\ncluding compensation for disabilities caused or aggravatedby active-duty military servic e.  \u00a7\u00a71110, 1131. The VA, led \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, administers the laws\nthat provide for those benefits.  \u00a7\u00a7301, 303.\nVeterans who suffer from service-connected post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are among those entitledto disability benefits. To establish service-connected PTSD, \nthe VA requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition \nand linking the veteran\u2019s symptoms with an \u201cin-service \nstressor,\u201d as well as credible evidence that the in-service stressor occurred. 38 CFR \u00a73.304(f ) (2023).  When the VA \nfinds those conditions satisfied, it assigns a disability ratingthat reflects reductions in earning capacity.  38 U. S. C. \n\u00a71155; 38 CFR \u00a74.130. This rating determines the amount \nof compensation a veteran receives.\nA veteran begins the claims process by submitting a re-\nquest for benefits to the VA. A VA regional office then ad-\njudicates the claim.  If the regional office issues an adverse \ndecision, the veteran may seek de novo review from the \nBoard of Veterans\u2019 Appeals.  The Board is an administra-\ntive body within the VA that renders final decisions for the \nagency. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77101, 7104(a).\nCongress designed the VA\u2019s adjudicatory process to func-\ntion \u201c \u2018with a high degree of informality and solicitude for \nthe claimant.\u2019 \u201d  Henderson  v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 431 \n(2011) (quoting Walters  v. National Assn. of Radiation Sur -\nvivors, 473 U. S. 305, 311 (1985)).  For example, Congress imposes no statute of limitations on a veteran\u2019s claim for \nbenefits.

And, the VA must assist veterans in developing\nthe evidence necessary to substantiate their claims. 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103A(a)(1).\nCongress also requires the re gional offices and the Board \nto give veterans the benefit of  the doubt on close issues.\nSpecifically, the VA must \u201cconsider all information and lay and medical evidence of record,\u201d and, \u201c[w]hen there is anapproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re-\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat-\nter, the [VA] shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claim-\nant.\u201d \u00a75107(b).  This rule reflects a pro-veteran policy\nchoice that dates back to the post-Civil War era. See 50 Fed. Reg. 34454 (1985).\nA veteran who receives an adverse decision from the \nBoard may appeal to the Vete rans Court, an Article I tribu-\nnal. The Veterans Court has exclusive jurisdiction to re -\nview final decisions of the Board.  \u00a77252(a).\nSection 7261 defines the scope of the Veterans Court\u2019s re-\nview. Subsection (a), which sets forth the court\u2019s adjudica-tory powers, is modeled after the scope-of-review provision \nin the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706. It empowers the Veter ans Court to decide relevant \nquestions of law; to compel action unlawfully withheld or\nunreasonably delayed; and to hold unlawful and set aside \nVA findings, conclusions, rules, and regulations that are ar-bitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law.  38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1)\u2013(3).  Un-\nlike the APA, however, \u00a77261(a) imposes a slightly different \nstandard of review for factual findings. The Veterans Court \nmay set aside or reverse a factual finding only if \u201cthe find-ing is clearly erroneous,\u201d in contrast to the APA\u2019s \u201csubstan -\ntial evidence\u201d standard.  \u00a77261(a)(4); see Dickinson v. \nZurko , 527 U. S. 150, 153, 162\u2013163 (1999) (examining the\n\u201csubtle\u201d difference between the two standards).\nSubsection (b) sets forth ad ditional requirements that the \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 BUFKIN v.

As originally en-\nacted, the provision required only that the Veterans Court\u201c\u2018take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\u2019 \u201d  Veter-\nans\u2019 Judicial Review Act, \u00a7301(a), 102 Stat. 4115 (now cod-ified at 38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2)).  We have held that this \nstatutory command requires the Veterans Court to apply \nthe same kind of harmless-error rule that courts ordinarilyapply in civil cases. Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U. S. 396, 406 \n(2009).\nIn 2002, Congress amended subsection (b) to add the pro-\nvision at issue here. Veterans Benefits Act, \u00a7401(b), 116 Stat. 2832. Codified at \u00a77261(b)(1), it directs the VeteransCourt to \u201c \u2018take due account of the [ VA]\u2019s application of sec-\ntion 5107(b) of this title.\u2019 \u201d  In other words, when conducting\njudicial review under subsection (a), the Veterans Court \nmust \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nIn most cases, an appeal to  the Veterans Court is a vet-\neran\u2019s final opportunity for judici al review of a benefits de-\ncision. Although veterans ma y appeal certain legal issues\nto the United States Court of  Appeals for the Federal Cir-\ncuit, see \u00a77292, that court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to review most factual dete rminations, including whether \nthe VA properly applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule in in -\ndividual cases, see Ferguson v. Principi , 273 F. 3d 1072, \n1076 (2001). \nB \nPetitioners are veterans who applied for service-\nconnected PTSD disability benefi ts and were dissatisfied \nwith the VA\u2019s resolution of their claims. \n1 \nPetitioner Joshua Bufkin served in the Air Force from \nlate 2005 to early 2006. Although Bufkin intended to join \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 5 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nthe military police, he never received a job assignment be-\ncause he could not pass the required training classes.\nBufkin blamed his poor performance on marital stress. He reported that his wife opposed his service and had threat-\nened to commit suicide if he st ayed in the military.  Bufkin \nultimately requested and obtained a nonprejudicial hard-ship discharge.\nSeven years later, Bufkin sought disability benefits from \nthe VA. He claimed that his military service caused several psychiatric conditions, including PTSD. To support his \nPTSD claim, Bufkin submitted a letter from a VA physicianwho had recently treated him. The physician explained\nthat Bufkin\u2019s wife suffered from depression, and that \nBufkin felt forced to make a choice between divorcing his \nwife or leaving the military.  The physician diagnosedBufkin with PTSD and opined that the primary stressor was the perceived threat to his wife\u2019s life. \nThe VA regional office denied Bufkin\u2019s claim on the \nground that the medical evidence was insufficient to estab-\nlish a link between his symptoms and his military service. \nBufkin sought reconsideration, and the VA ordered a sec-ond examination by a second VA physician.  The new phy-\nsician determined that Bufkin did not meet the criteria for \nPTSD. He explained that the first physician was unable to\nreview Bufkin\u2019s military or medical records, a limitation \nthat may have had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Bufkin\u2019s initialdiagnosis. App. in No. 2022\u20131089 (CA Fed.), pp. 29\u201330. \nBufkin also submitted letters from his wife and mother de -\nscribing changes they observed  in his personality after his\nmilitary service.\nThe VA regional office revi ewed the new information and \nreaffirmed its denial of Bufkin\u2019s claim.  Bufkin filed a notice of disagreement.  He argued that the evidence for and \nagainst his claim was roughly equal and that he was there-\nfore entitled to \u201cthe benefit of the doubt.\u201d  \u00a75107(b).  Bufkin \nthen underwent a third VA examination by yet another \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nphysician. Like the second physician, this physician con-\ncluded that Bufkin\u2019s symptoms  did not meet the criteria for\nPTSD. She also noted that Bufkin\u2019s symptoms started one \nyear after his discharge, and that no evidence indicated that his military service caused a disability.  The VA re -\ngional office again reaffirmed its decision to deny benefits. \nBufkin appealed to the Board. While the appeal was\npending, he submitted a short statement from a fourth phy-\nsician. This physician stated that, in his opinion, Bufkin \nsuffered from PTSD, but he no ted other doctors might dis-\nagree with that diagnosis.  He suggested that, at a mini-\nmum, Bufkin suffered from severe anxiety disorder. \nThe Board concluded that Bufkin did not suffer from \nPTSD and denied his claim. In a detailed opinion, the\nBoard recounted each physici an\u2019s findings and medical con-\nclusions. The Board observed that one physician diagnosed \nBufkin with PTSD, two physicians determined he did not \nhave PTSD, and one physician thought the issue was debat-\nable. After carefully reviewing each medical opinion, the\nBoard explained that it found the second physician\u2019s report \n\u201cespecially persuasive.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.  The Board noted that the one physician to diagnose Bufkin with\nPTSD had not reviewed his military or medical records.\nThe Board also reviewed the letters from Bufkin\u2019s wife and \nmother but found that they lacked probative value because \nneither individual had relev ant medical expertise.  When \ntaken as a whole, the Board explained, the evidence was not\nin approximate balance. Accordingly, the Board deter-\nmined that Bufkin was not enti tled to the benefit of the \ndoubt. \n2 \nPetitioner Norman Thornton served in the Army from\n1988 to 1991. After being honorably discharged, Thorntonapplied for and received benefits for an \u201c \u2018undiagnosed ill -\n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 604 U.

The VA granted benefits\nfor the PTSD claim, initially rating his condition as 10%\ndisabling and later increasing the rating to 30%.\nIn 2015, Thornton applied for another increase to his\nPTSD disability rating and underwent a new VA medical\nexamination. The physician concluded that Thornton suf-\nfered some common PTSD symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, memory loss, and sleep impairment, but \nquestioned whether PTSD was the cause of those symp-\ntoms. The physician did not find several of the more severe \nsymptoms that earlier medical examinations had revealed,\nsuch as suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, and panic attacks.  Nevertheless, the regional office increased\nThornton\u2019s PTSD disability rati ng to 50%.  Thornton then \nsought an additional increase to 70% and underwent an -\nother medical evaluation, but the regional office main-tained the 50% rating.\nThornton appealed to the Board, which reviewed the evi-\ndence de novo. As in Bufkin\u2019s case, the Board thoroughly\nrecounted each medical report and assessed the credibility \nof each physician\u2019s findings. The Board ultimately declined\nto increase Thornton\u2019s 50% disability rating.\n1 \n3 \nBoth petitioners appealed the Board\u2019s resolution of their\nPTSD claims to the Veterans Court. They argued that the\nevidence concerning their diagnoses was in \u201capproximate\nbalance,\u201d so they were entitled to the benefit of the doubt.See \u00a75107(b).  In both cases, the Veterans Court upheld \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1At the same time, the Board granted Thornton a \u201ctotal disability\u201d rat-\ning for his separate claim of unemplo yability, based on the combined ef -\nfect of his service-connected PTSD an d the undiagnosed illness.  App. to \nPet. for Cert. 86a\u201389a.  Thornton currently receives full benefits, but \nthose benefits are subject to continual review.

COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nthe Board\u2019s decisions on the ground that the Board\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinatio ns were not clearly erro-\nneous. \nThe petitioners then appealed to the Federal Circuit,\nchallenging the Veterans Court\u2019s legal interpretation of \n\u00a77261(b)(1). They argued that the statutory command to\n\u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-\nthe-doubt rule requires the Veterans Court to review the entire record de novo and decide for itself whether the evi -\ndence is in approximate balance.\nThe Federal Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed \nthe Veterans Court in both cases.  75 F. 4th 1368 (2023); 2023 WL 5091653 (Aug. 9, 2023).  The court held that \u201cthe statutory command that the Veterans Court \u2018take due ac -\ncount\u2019 of the benefit of the doubt rule does not require the Veterans Court to conduct any review of the benefit of the \ndoubt issue beyond the clear error review required by\u201d\n\u00a77261(a). Id., at *2. \nWe granted certiorari to decide what it means to \u201ctake\ndue account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. 601 U. S. ___ (2024). \nII \nA \nWe start, as always, with the text. Section 7261(b)(1) pro -\nvides that \u201c[i]n making the determinations under subsec-tion (a),\u201d the Veterans Court \u201cshall\u201d \u201ctake due account of\nthe [VA]\u2019s application of [the benefit-of-the-doubt rule].\u201d \nThe plain meaning of the text reveals the scope of the\nVeterans Court\u2019s task.  It is undisputed that the word \n\u201cshall\u201d imposes a mandatory command.  Shapiro  v. \nMcManus , 577 U. S. 39, 43 (2015).  \u201cShall\u201d means \u201cmust.\u201d \nKingdomware Technologies, Inc.  v. United States, 579 U. S. \n162, 171\u2013172 (2016).  It is likewise undisputed that to \u201ctake account of \u201d something means to give it attention or consid-\neration. See American Heritage Dictionary 1763 (4th ed. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 9 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \n2000) (defining \u201ctake account of \u201d as \u201c[t]o take into consid-\neration\u201d). The word \u201cdue\u201d qualifies the attention that the \nVA must give. \u201cDue\u201d means \u201capp ropriate\u201d or \u201cproper.\u201d  See \n4 Oxford English Dictionary 1105 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cMerited,\nappropriate: proper, right\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 515\n(7th ed. 1999) (\u201cJust, proper, regular, and reasonable\u201d).\nTaken together, the statutory command to \u201ctake due ac-\ncount\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule requires the Veterans Cou rt to give appropriate atten-\ntion to the VA\u2019s work, at least when the issue is properly presented. See id., at 516 (defining \u201cdue consideration\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he degree of attention properly paid to something, as the circumstances merit\u201d).\n2 \nThe text makes clear that the appropriate attention due\nis that which is required under subsection (a).  Sec-tion 7261(b)(1) states that the Veterans Court must \u201ctake \ndue account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-\ndoubt rule only \u201c[i]n making the determinations under sub -\nsection (a).\u201d This language highlights that taking due ac-\ncount is not a freestanding task but rather an aspect of ju-\ndicial review under subsection (a).\nThe upshot is straightforward. Review of the VA\u2019s \nbenefit-of-the-doubt decision is just another determination\nmade \u201cunder subsection (a).\u201d \u00a77261(b)(1).  Accordingly, thestandards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern \nthe Veterans Court\u2019s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues. \nIn particular, subsection (a) requires the Veterans Court toreview the VA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo  and its findings\nof fact for clear error. See \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1) and (4). Which \nstandard applies will depend on whether a veteran raises a \nlegal or factual objection. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n2Petitioners invite us to decide whether the Veterans Court must ad-\ndress the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule when a veteran \ndoes not raise the issue as a ground for reversal.  Because both petition-ers adequately preserved and raised their challenges below, we leave\nthat question for another day. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nSection 7261(b)(1) makes explicit the Veterans Court\u2019s\npreviously implicit duty to review the VA\u2019s application of \nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule, pursuant to the standards set \nforth in subsection (a).  Of course, this duty predated Con-\ngress\u2019s enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1); subsection (a) always re-\nquired the Veterans Court to revi ew all relevant findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.  See \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1) and (4). But, Congress\u2019s enactment underscores the benefit-of-the-doubt rule\u2019s status as a paramount consideration. \nB \nThe next question, then, is the appropriate standard of\nreview for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-\nof-the-doubt rule. The applicable standard will vary with the challenge, as the application of the rule has both factual \nand legal components. A veteran may challenge any aspect\nof the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule onappeal.\nNo one disputes that challenges to the VA\u2019s legal conclu-\nsions are subject to de novo  review. For example, if the vet-\neran argues that the VA misunderstood the definition of \u201capproximate balance,\u201d the Ve terans Court would construe \nthe challenge as a legal one and review it de novo . So too if \nthe veteran argues that the VA gave the benefit of the doubt to the wrong party.\nThese arguments, however, are not the typical argu-\nments a veteran raises on appeal.  In mine-run cases, in-\ncluding the two before us, a veteran challenges the VA\u2019s de-\ntermination that the evidence on a particular material issue is not in approximate balance. \nPetitioners assert that the approximate-balance determi-\nnation is a legal inquiry subject to de novo review. The Gov-\nernment counters that the determination is a factual find-ing, or at least a mixed question that is predominantly factual and reviewed for clear error.  After closely examin-\ning the way in which the VA conducts the approximate -\n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 11 Cite as: 604 U. S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nbalance inquiry, we conclude it is a predominantly factual \nquestion and thus subject to clear-error review.\nThe approximate-balance determination involves two \nsteps. First, the VA reviews each item of evidence in the record and assigns weight to it.  Both sides agree that this\naspect of the VA\u2019s analysis is factfinding reviewed only for \nclear error. Second, the VA assesses the weight of the evi-\ndence as a whole, deciding whether \u201cthere is an approxi-mate balance of positive and negative evidence\u201d on any ma-\nterial issue.  \u00a75107(b). The VA gives the benefit of the doubt \nto the veteran only after dete rmining that the positive evi-\ndence and negative evidence on a material issue are in ap-\nproximate balance. Otherwise, the VA simply resolves the \nissue in favor of the party with the more persuasive evi-\ndence. \nThe second step\u2014deciding whether the evidence as a\nwhole is approximately balanced\u2014has both legal and fac-tual components. The task is partly factual because it in-\nvolves marshaling and weighing evidence.  See U. S. Bank \nN. A.  v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC , 583 U. S. 387, 396 \n(2018). The VA must categorize the evidence based on \nwhether it supports or undermines the veteran\u2019s claim. Af -\nter doing so, the VA compares th e relative strength and per-\nsuasiveness of the evidence on each side.  Assigning weightto evidence\u2014whether individual pieces of evidence or col-\nlections of it\u2014is an inherently factual task. See ibid.   But, \nthe VA\u2019s decision also involves a legal determination.  After \nassessing the weight of the assorted evidence, the VA must decide whether the evidence is in \u201capproximate balance.\u201d\nSee \u00a75107(b).  In other words, the VA must determine \nwhether the evidence satisfies a legal standard.  Because \nthe VA\u2019s approximate-balance de termination involves both \nlegal and factual work, it is at most a mixed question, not a \n  \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \npurely legal one.3 \nThe appropriate standard of review for a mixed question\ndepends \u201con whether answering it entails primarily legal or\nfactual work.\u201d U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 396.  Some mixed \nquestions require a court to \u201ce xpound on the law\u201d by \u201cam -\nplifying or elaborating on a broad legal standard.\u201d Ibid. \nWhen applying the law involves developing legal principles for use in future cases, appella te courts typically review the \ndecision de novo . Ibid.  Other mixed questions require \ncourts to resolve \u201ccase-spe cific factual issues.\u201d Ibid. When \nthe tribunal below is \u201cimmerse[d] \u201d in facts and compelled to\n\u201cmarshal and weigh evidence\u201d and \u201cmake credibility judg-ments,\u201d the appellate court \u201cshould usually review a deci-\nsion with deference.\u201d Ibid. \nReviewing a determination wh ether record evidence is \napproximately balanced is \u201cabout as factual sounding\u201d as \nany question gets. Id., at 397.  Consider Bufkin\u2019s case. To \ndecide whether Bufkin was entitled to the benefit of the \ndoubt, the Board reviewed four medical opinions and two \nletters from Bufkin\u2019s family  members.  After assigning \nweight to each item, the Board assessed whether the evi -\ndence was roughly equal. To make that determination, the Board had to consider evidence of Bufkin\u2019s symptoms and \ntheir causes, while assessing the credibility of the physi-\ncians who treated him. Thornton\u2019s case is no different.  The \nBoard assessed the weight of his symptoms, the degree \nto which they affected his day-to-day life, and the credi-bility of each physician.  These cases illustrate that the \napproximate-balance determination necessarily immerses \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n3We need not decide whether the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determi-\nnation is best characterized as a mixed question or a factual one. See \nAlexander  v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP , 602 U. S. 1, \n18\u201319 (2024) (observing that \u201ca finding of fact\u201d may involve applicationof a \u201cstandard of proof \u201d with a \u201csubstantial legal component\u201d).  Whether \nthe determination is mixed or factual, clear-error review is appropriate \nbecause it is at least predominantly factual. \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n 13 Cite as: 604 U.

Ibid. \nC \nPetitioners and the dissent offer various paths to a differ-\nent result. But, their arguments are not persuasive. \nFirst, petitioners urge us to hold that with one modest\nphrase, \u201ctake due account,\u201d Congress imposed a new stand-\nard of review for challenges to the VA\u2019s application of the\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Be fore the Federal Circuit, peti -\ntioners argued that \u00a77261(b)(1) established a de novo  stand-\nard of review.  They hesitate to call the standard \u201c de novo \nreview\u201d before this Court, in stead describing it as \u201cAPA -\nplus.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25, 41\u201342. \nHowever labeled, the directive  to \u201ctake due account\u201d does \nnot do the work that petitioners envision.  Had Congress intended to impose a new standard of review for challenges \nto the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, it would have clearly named a standard\u2014just as it did in \n\u00a77261(a). But, as we have explained, Congress chose not to \nannounce any new standard in \u00a77261(b)(1).  It instead in-\ncorporated the pre-existing standards of review set forth in\nsubsection (a). \nPetitioners contend, in the alternative, that even if \n\u00a77261(b)(1) incorporates the standards of review in \u00a77261(a), the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is a \nlegal question subject to de novo review under \u00a77261(a).\nThe dissent adopts a similar view, arguing that the approx-imate-balance determination is a predominantly legal \nmixed question. Post, at 12\u201316 (opinion of J\nACKSON , J.). \nThe de novo standard applies, they say, because the \napproximate-balance determination resembles other legalor predominantly legal quest ions that courts review de \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n 14 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nnovo . They point to judicial review of a court\u2019s probable-\ncause determination as one such analogue.  Post, at 14\u201315. \nProbable cause is the standard by which a court assesses \nwhether a police officer\u2019s search or seizure was permissible \nunder the Fourth Amendment.  For example, \u201cprobablecause to search . . . exist[s] where the known facts and cir -\ncumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a \ncrime will be found.\u201d  Ornelas  v. United States, 517 U. S. \n690, 696 (1996).  We have held that this inquiry is a mixedquestion that courts review de novo . See id., at 699. \nTwo features of the probable-cause determination distin-\nguish it from the approximate-balance determination, how -\never, and underscore why courts review it de novo . First, \nbecause probable cause is a constitutional standard, we \nstart with a strong presumptio n that determinations under \nthat standard are subject to de novo  review, even if they\nrequire courts to \u201cplung[e] into a factual record.\u201d U. S. \nBank, 583 U. S., at 396, n. 4.  Second, probable cause at bot-\ntom poses a question that requires substantial \u201clegal work.\u201d \nId., at 398.  Because probable cause asks whether the \u201cof-\nficer\u2019s understanding of the facts and his understanding ofthe relevant law\u201d was \u201creasonable,\u201d Heien  v. North Caro-\nlina, 574 U. S. 54, 61\u201364 (2014), it requires an objective, le-\ngally grounded inquiry as to what a hypothetical person \ncould have found, see Kentucky  v. King , 563 U. S. 452, 464 \n(2011). The answer to how a hypothetical person would act \nis, by its nature, one that cou rts refine over time, building\nout principles that \u201cacquire content only through applica-tion.\u201d Ornelas , 517 U. S., at 697.  De novo review is there-\nfore essential so that courts can ensure \u201cunif[orm] prece -\ndent\u201d that will \u201cprovid[e] law enforcement officers with a \ndefined set of rules which, in most instances, makes it pos-sible to reach a correct determination beforehand as to \nwhether an invasion of privacy is justified.\u201d  Ibid.

S. ____ (2025) \nOpinion of the Court \nThe VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination differs on \nboth counts. First, the standard is a creature of statute. \nBecause it does not dwell \u201c[i]n the constitutional realm,\u201d it is not entitled to the presumption of de novo  review that \napplies to probable cause.  U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 396, \nn. 4. Second, the approximate-balance inquiry does not \nhave a comparable legal component. Instead, as these cases exemplify, that inquiry tends to be case specific and fact in -\ntensive, with courts evaluating the weight of the evidence \nfor and against a particular ve teran\u2019s claim.  To decide \nBufkin\u2019s claim, for example, the VA reviewed a panoply ofmedical and lay evidence, and Bufkin\u2019s central argument \nbefore the Veterans Court was that the overall balance of this evidence was closer than the VA thought.  Thornton\u2019s \nclaim similarly presented case-specific, fact-bound issues\nabout the existence and severity of symptoms. Resolution \nof these claims is unlikely to generate guidance for the VA\nor future courts in the way that probable-cause precedentsdo for police and the courts.\n The VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination is likewise \ndistinct from a court\u2019s conclusion that evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction , a conclusion that courts\nreview de novo . See Jackson v. Virginia , 443 U. S. 307, \n318\u2013319 (1979). While the sufficiency-of-the-evidence in-quiry necessarily turns on facts, the reviewing court does\nnot decide for itself whether the evidence establishes guilt \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  Instead, it construes all evi-dence and makes all reasonable inferences in favor of the prosecution, and asks whether \u201c any rational trier of fact \ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 319. Courts therefore conduct \ntheir review through a legal le ns, applying a hypothetical, \nobjective standard and putting a thumb on the scale in fa -\nvor of the prevailing party\u2014the prosecution. No one\u2014peti-tioners and the dissent included\u2014wants the Veterans Court to do that. Instead, petitioners and the dissent would \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 16 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nOpinion of the Court \nhave the Veterans Court \u201cweigh the evidence\u201d in the first\ninstance and then make \u201cinferences from basic facts to ulti-\nmate facts\u201d\u2014precisely what a court may not d o  o n  s u f f i -\nciency review. Ibid. \nPetitioners and the dissent also rely heavily on the asser-\ntion that our reading of \u00a77261(b)(1) renders the provision\nsuperfluous. Post, at 9\u201311. That objection is a serious one.\n\u201cWe are reluctant to treat statutory terms as surplusage inany setting.\u201d TRW Inc.  v. Andrews , 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Our reluctance in-\ncreases when Congress amends a statute, as we ordinarily \npresume that when Congress does so, \u201c \u2018it intends its\namendment to have real and substantial effect.\u2019 \u201d  Intel \nCorp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. , 542 U. S. 241, 258\u2013 \n259 (2004).\nBut, our reading of \u00a77261(b)(1) gives that provision a \nfunction, even if it might involve some redundancy.  As we \nhave explained, Congress\u2019s amendment makes express the \nVeterans Court\u2019s obligation to review challenges to the VA\u2019s\napplication of the benefit-of-the -doubt rule according to the \nstandards set forth in \u00a77261(a).  Moreover, as the dissent notes, we have left open th e possibility that Congress\u2019s en-\nactment requires the Veterans Court to review the VA\u2019s ap -\nplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule even if the veteranfails to present that issue on appeal.  See n. 2, supra; post, \nat 10. If the Court were to decide that Congress\u2019s enact-ment changed the party-presentation requirement, thenthe enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1) would serve an additional in-\ndependent function.\nNotably, the dissent fails to offer a reading of the text that\navoids redundancy. According to the dissent, the VA\u2019s \napproximate-balance determinat ion is a predominantly le-\ngal question subject to de novo  review. Post, at 12\u201316. But, \nif the dissent were correct, then the approximate-balance determination would have been subject to de novo  review \neven before the enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1).

Thus, under the dissent\u2019s interpreta-\ntion\u2014no less than ours\u2014the enactment of \u00a77261(b)(1) merely underscores a pre-existing duty.  The canon against \nsurplusage can be meaningful when a competing interpre -\ntation would avoid superfluity. Microsoft Corp.  v. i4i L. P., \n564 U. S. 91, 106 (2011).  But, when both interpretations involve the same redundancy, the canon against surplusage\nsimply does not apply. See Marx  v. General Revenue Corp. , \n568 U.

See 38 \nU. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(1).  First, it holds that when the United \nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) reviews the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA\u2019s)\napplication of the \u201cbenefit-of-the-doubt\u201d rule, that appellatetribunal must use the \u201csame\u201d standards of review that ap-\nply to its assessment of any other VA claims determination. \nAnte , at 1.  Second, the Court concludes that whether \nevidence is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d for purposes of thebenefit-of-the-doubt rule is a \u201cpredominantly factual deter-\nmination\u201d to be reviewed only for clear error. Ante , at 2. \nThe majority is wrong in both respects.  Nothing about \nthe text, context, or drafting history of subsection (b)(1)\ndemonstrates that \u201ctake due a ccount\u201d actually means \u201cpro-\nceed as normal.\u201d Reading the provision in that fashion, asthe majority does, makes little sense. That interpretation \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nJACKSON , J., dissenting \nis also inconsistent with how we have treated identical lan-\nguage elsewhere in this same  statute and renders meaning-\nless the \u201ctake due account\u201d command that Congress specif-\nically amended \u00a77261(b) to insert.\nThe majority\u2019s clear-error conclusion fares no better, in-\nsofar as its reasoning ignores what appellate courts do and \nwhat we have consistently sa id about substantially similar \ncircumstances.  That is, even if the majority were correct \nthat subsection (b)(1) instructs the Veterans Court to carry\non applying the usual standards, clear-error review would \nnot be appropriate because whether the VA properly ap-plied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not present a ques-\ntion of fact. The VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt determination \nposes, at most, a mixed question of law and fact\u2014and one \nthat is substantively indistinguishable from the kinds of \nmixed questions that this Court has long said are subject to de novo  review on appeal.\nIn short, the Court today concludes that Congress meant \nnothing when it inserted subse ction (b)(1) in response to \nconcerns that the Veterans Court was improperly rub -\nberstamping the VA\u2019s benefit-o f-the-doubt determinations,\nand also that the Veterans Court is not obliged to do any-thing more than defer to those agency decisions notwith-standing Congress\u2019s \u201ctake due account\u201d direction.  I respect-\nfully dissent. \nI \nUnder the time-honored bene fit-of-the-doubt rule, veter-\nans asserting claims for service-connected disabilities are \nentitled to have any reasonable doubt on a material issue \nresolved in their favor. Congress codified this rule in 1988:\nSection 5107(b) of Title 38 states unequivocally that the VA must \u201cgive the benefit of the doubt to the claimant\u201d when-\never \u201cthere is an approximate balance of positive and nega-\ntive evidence regarding any issu e material to the\u201d veteran\u2019s\nbenefits claim.

As relevant here, the Veterans \nCourt is authorized to (1) \u201cdecide all relevant questions of law\u201d; (2) \u201ccompel action of the Secretary unlawfully with -\nheld or unreasonably delayed\u201d; and (3) \u201chold unlawful andset aside\u201d certain VA decisions. \u00a7\u00a77261(a)(1)\u2013(3). Notably,clause (4) of \u00a77261(a) states that \u201cin the case of a finding of \nmaterial fact adverse to the claimant made in reaching a\ndecision in a case before the [ VA] with respect to benefits,\u201d \nthe Veterans Court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside or reverse such finding if the finding is clearly erroneous.\u201d \u00a77261(a)(4).\nFor present purposes, all parties agree that \u00a77261(a) has\nalways authorized the Veterans Court to review the VA\u2019s \napplication of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  But judicial re-view of that issue proved illu sory from the start, because \nthe Veterans Court historically applied a deferential stand-\nard of review for assessing th e VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt de-\nterminations. See, e.g., Gilbert  v. Derwinski , 1 Vet. App. 49,\n57\u201358 (1990); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 \n(2001). As a result, veterans groups routinely complained to Congress that judicial revi ew by the Veterans Court was\ninappropriately deferential. See, e.g., Hearing before the \nSenate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, 107th Cong., 2dSess., 47 (2002) (statement of the legislative director of a \nveterans group); see also Brie f for Federal Circuit Bar As -\nsociation as Amicus Curiae 11\u201314. \nCongress responded in 2002, when it amended \u00a77261(b)\nto specifically require the Ve terans Court to \u201ctake due ac-\ncount of \u201d the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt \nrule. \u00a77261(b)(1).

The majority and I agreethat subsection (b)(1) imposes a \u201cstatutory command\u201d that \nthe Veterans Court \u201cgive appropriate attention to the VA\u2019s\nwork\u201d related to its applicatio n of the benefit-of-the-doubt \nrule.

In my view, that holding is unmoored \nfrom subsection (b)(1)\u2019s text, ignores \u00a77261\u2019s overall struc-ture and drafting history, and renders entirely superfluousCongress\u2019s requirement that the Veterans Court \u201ctake due \naccount\u201d of the application of th e benefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nThe better reading of the statute recognizes that subsection(b)(1) requires the Veterans Co urt to determine, without \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n1Subsection (b)(1) cross references \u00a75107(b), which (as explained above\nand bears repeating) codifies the benefit-of-the-doubt rule: \u201cWhen there \nis an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall\ngive the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.\u201d  \u00a75107(b).

Based on that prefatory \nlanguage, the majority reasons that subsection (b)(1) ismerely an \u201c aspect  of \u201d the review that the Veterans Court \nperforms under subsection (a), such that the \u201cstandards of review provided in subsection (a) also govern the Veterans\nCourt\u2019s review of benefit-of-the-doubt issues.\u201d  Ante , at 9. \nBut the fact that the Veterans Court must apply subsec-\ntion (b)(1) \u201c[i]n making the determinations under subsec-\ntion (a)\u201d does not justify collapsing these two provisions. \nThe word \u201cin,\u201d when paired with a gerund\u2014here, \u201cmak-\ning\u201d\u2014is generally \u201cequivalent in sense to a temporal clause \nintroduced by when , while , if, [or] in the event of.\u201d 7 Oxford \nEnglish Dictionary 760 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis in original). \nThe \u201cin making\u201d clause in subsection (b) thus merely pro-\nvides that when the Veterans Court makes one of the deter-\nminations authorized by subsection (a), it must also  satisfy \nits duty to \u201ctake due account of \u201d the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule. In other words, the \u201cin making\u201d clause the majority seizes upon to justify its same-\nstandards holding simply establishes that review under \nsubsection (b)(1) occurs alongside review under subsection \n(a), not that they are the same thing. \nInterpreting subsection (b)(1) to require a separate, con-\ncurrent review of the VA\u2019s compliance with the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is consistent with how this Court has inter-\npreted subsection (b)(1)\u2019s parallel provision\u2014subsection \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  6 BUFKIN v.

In Shinseki  v. Sanders , 556 U. S. 396 (2009), \nwe held that subsection (b)(2) \u201crequires the Veterans Courtto apply the same kind of \u2018har mless-error\u2019 rule that courts\nordinarily apply in civil cases,\u201d id., at 406. We did not sug-\ngest\u2014much less hold\u2014that subsection (a)\u2019s standards of re -\nview governed subsection (b)(2 )\u2019s \u201ctake due account\u201d clause. \nTo the contrary, we explained that the Veterans Court is \nnot prevented from \u201cdirectly asking the harmless-error \nquestion\u201d and \u201cresting its conclusion on the facts and cir-\ncumstances of the particular case.\u201d Id., at 408. \nThus, there is no dispute that, under subsection (b)(2), \nthe Veterans Court analyzes whether any error was harm-less de novo , without applying the standards of review pre-\nscribed by subsection (a).  And because subsection (a)\u2019sstandards do not apply when the Veterans Court \u201ctake[s]\ndue account of the rule of prejudicial error\u201d under subsec-\ntion (b)(2), it is oddly discordant for the majority to concludethat those standards do apply when the Veterans Court\n\u201ctake[s] due account of the Secretary\u2019s application of \u201d the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.  See FCC  v. AT&T Inc. , 562 U.

It \ninstead amended subsection (a)(4) only to empower the Vet-\nerans Court to reverse certain factual findings ( i.e., those \nthat are material and adverse to the claimant), and neither \nmodified subsection (a)(4)\u2019s clear-error standard nor in-\nserted a requirement that the Veterans Court review the \nVA\u2019s application of the benefi t-of-the-doubt rule into that \nprovision. \u00a7401, 116 Stat. 2832.  At the end of the day, then, \ninstead of incorporating a benefit-of-the-doubt-rule re-\nminder into subsection (a)(4), Congress crafted an entirely \nnew statutory provision\u2014subsection (b)(1)\u2014to address ju-dicial review of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-\ndoubt rule. Ibid. \nRecognizing that review under subsection (b)(1) is dis-\ntinct from review under subsection (a)(4) respects Con-\ngress\u2019s choice to separate thos e two provisions.  It also com-\nports with subsection (b)(1)\u2019s language and the statute\u2019s \noverall design.  No one disputes that Congress sought to \nsubject the VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-d oubt decisions to increased\njudicial scrutiny while otherwise preserving the VA\u2019s not-clearly-erroneous factual findings. Reading subsection(b)(1) to be such a congressional mandate furthers that ob-\njective, while the majority\u2019s conclusion that subsection \n(b)(1) implicitly incorporates subsection (a)(4)\u2019s limited \nclear-error standard undermines it. \nC \nThe usual indicators of statutory meaning thus confirm \nthat subsection (b)(1) was meant to have bite.

Still, the majority \nmaintains that subsection (b)(1) has a \u201cfunction\u201d even if it \nperforms zero independent work. Ibid.

Ibid. But the majority cannot overcome the\nsurplusage problem simply by asserting that subsection \n(b)(1) emphasizes or clarifies a pre-existing duty.  To state \nthe obvious, \u201cmost superfluous language\u201d can be justified as\nproviding \u201cclarity.\u201d NLRB  v. SW General, Inc. , 580 U. S. \n288, 304 (2017).  Perhaps for this reason, the majority does \nnot identify any other case in  which this Court held that \nCongress passed an amendment with no substantive effect.\nMoreover, the majority does not and cannot explain why \nany such expression of the Veterans Court\u2019s duties was needed\u2014much less why Congress would go out of its way toamend the statute to underscor e an existing obligation.\nSubsection (a) covers the waterfront of possible exercises of judicial authority and has always  required the Veterans\nCourt to consider any argument \u201cpresented\u201d by a veteran. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  10 BUFKIN v. COLLINS \nJACKSON , J., dissenting \nSubsection (a) cannot be reaso nably read to exclude consid-\neration of a veteran\u2019s claim that the VA misapplied the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule.  And no one actually thought this; \nindeed, prior to Congress\u2019s enactment of subsection (b)(1),\nthe Veterans Court regularly considered challenges to the \nVA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule\u2014it just did \nso deferentially. See supra, at 3\u20134. \nThus, the problem that Congress enacted subsection \n(b)(1) to address was not that the Veterans Court seemed to \nhave limited authority under subsection (a). Nor was it \nthat the Veterans Court was somehow unaware of its duty \nto review the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the doubt \nrule upon request. Rather, as I have explained, Congressenacted subsection (b)(1) afte r veterans service organiza -\ntions brought to its attention how the Veterans Court was \nperforming that review\u2014 i.e., it was giving too much defer-\nence to the VA\u2019s benefit-of-t he-doubt determinations.  Ibid . \nCongress\u2019s indisputable focus was on the improper degree\nof deference the Veterans Court was affording to the VA\u2019s\ndeterminations, a target that the majority\u2019s reading misses completely. Nor is the majority\u2019s surplusage problem \nsolved by the \u201cpossibility\u201d that subsection (b)(1) requires \nsua sponte  review of the VA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt determi-\nnations. Ante, at 16. Even assuming that subsection (b)(1) \nseeks to effect that change, sua sponte  review would make \nno difference unless the Veterans Court proceeds nondefer-entially. A rubberstamp applied to every case remains a\nrubberstamp.\nFinally, the majority maintains that if Congress had in-\ntended for subsection (b)(1) to do anything other than un-\nderscore the pre-existing duty to consider challenges to the\nVA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt dete rminations, it would have \nmore clearly said so. Ante , at 13.  That gets things exactly \nbackwards.  Ordinarily, when Congress amends a statute, \n\u201c\u2018\u201cwe presume it intends its amendment to have real and \nsubstantial effect.\u201d \u2019\u201d Husky Int\u2019l Electronics, Inc. v.

But if Congress had wanted to main-\ntain the status quo, why enact subsection (b)(1) at all? The presumption is, and should be, that Congress expects a \nchange when it goes through the trouble of amending a stat-\nute. And, here, the majority\u2019s reasoning has plainly failed to overcome that presumption. \nD \nThe veterans canon resolves whatever lingering doubt \nmight remain about the proper interpretation of subsection (b)(1). We have \u201clong applied \u2018the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be con-\nstrued in the beneficiaries\u2019 favor.\u2019 \u201d  Henderson  v.

Likewise, under \nthe veterans canon, \u201cinterpretive doubt is to be resolved inthe veteran\u2019s favor.\u201d Brown  v. Gardner , 513 U. S. 115, 118 \n(1994).\nThe veterans canon strongly supports interpreting sub-\nsection (b)(1) to represent more than Congress\u2019s grandilo-\nquence. Requiring subsection (b )(1) to affect the judicial re-\nview the Veterans Court provides aligns with the significance of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule and mitigates\nthe unique problems that arise in veterans\u2019 cases, including \nthat veterans are \u201coften unrepresented\u201d before the VA. Sanders , 556 U. S., at 412.  Veterans\u2019 claims also often in-\nvolve a considerable time lag that produces problems of proof, since no statute of limitations applies to such claims. \nD.

Arellano v. McDonough , 598 U. S. 1, 14 (2023).  Reading\nsubsection (b)(1) as a standalone command that requires \nthe Veterans Court to review the VA\u2019s application of the \nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule nondeferentially obviously favors \nveterans more than an interpretation that reduces the pro-\nvision to an exclamation point. \nIII \nThe majority does not stop at the mistaken conclusion \nthat Congress enacted subsection (b)(1) for no reason other\nthan to reiterate the Veterans  Court\u2019s pre-existing statu-\ntory duties.  It also proceeds to analyze how a challenge to the VA\u2019s application of the be nefit-of-the-doubt rule fares\nwhen filtered through the autho rity conferred to the Veter-\nans Court in subsection (a). In this regard, the majority reasons that part\u2014but not all\u2014of the VA\u2019s application of \nthe benefit-of-the-doubt rule mu st be reviewed for clear er -\nror.  Ante , at 10.  But in my view, the Court mischaracter-\nizes the \u201capproximate balance\u201d assessment under \u00a75107(b), which is the part of the analysis that is at issue here. The \nmajority maintains that that aspect of the benefit-of-the-\ndoubt rule involves the type of predominately factual find-ing that appellate courts ordinar ily review with deference. \nAnte , at 12\u201313.  Stated simply, such is not the case. \nA \nTo understand the majority\u2019s mistake, one must first be \nclear eyed about the two steps that are necessary for the Veterans Court to review the VA\u2019s application of the \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 Cite as: 604 U.

Firs t, the Veterans Court identi-\nfies and reviews the VA\u2019s relevant factual findings concern -\ning the evidence presented.  Then, the Veterans Court de-\ntermines whether, based on the VA\u2019s plausible factual\nfindings, the \u201cpositive and negative evidence\u201d is in \u201capprox -\nimate balance\u201d (what I call th e approximate-balance stand-\nard).\nAll agree that the clear-error standard applies to the VA\u2019s\nfactual findings regarding the evidence that the VeteransCourt examines at step one. So, for example, the Veterans\nCourt must accept the VA\u2019s determination that a particularpiece of evidence is reliable or that an individual medical \nexaminer is qualified, unless those findings are clearly er-\nroneous.  It is at the second step\u2014when the Veterans Court \ndetermines whether the evidence is in approximate bal-\nance\u2014that questions of law come in. \nAt step two, the Veterans Court is essentially being asked \nto decide whether a legal standard (\u201capproximate balance\u201d) has been satisfied on the established facts. As a general\nmatter, this Court has long treated the application of a legal \nstandard to a given set of facts as an exercise that poses a legal question. See, e.g., Guerrero-Lasprilla  v. Barr, 589 \nU. S. 221, 227\u2013228 (2020).  What the majority misses in its effort to shoehorn \u00a75107(b)\u2019s approximate-balance inquiry \ninto the question-of-fact category is the true nature of \nthat assessment, as well as the fact that making theapproximate-balance determination is more nuanced than\nsimply weighing the evidence on hand. \nFor one thing, the court must have a standard  for decid-\ning when the evidence before it  is in \u201capproximate balance\u201d\nas a matter of law. In our common-law legal system, devis-ing that standard happens over time, on a case-by-case ba-\nsis. Therefore, applying it might well involve examiningVeterans Court precedents concerning the meaning of \u201cap-\nproximate balance,\u201d as well as past cases that establish \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n 14 BUFKIN v.

At  step one, the appellate\ncourt identifies the relevant historical facts and reviews them for clear error. Id., at 696\u2013697, 699.

COLLINS \nJACKSON , J., dissenting \nThese examples demonstrate that nondeferential appel-\nlate review of factbound legal issues is not unprecedented. \nAnd under \u00a77261(b)(1), the Veterans Court must follow suit. Section 7261(b)(1) directs the Veterans Court to eval-\nuate the VA\u2019s approximate-balance decisions by first ac -\ncepting the agency\u2019s not-clearly-erroneous factual findings about the evidence presented and then determining\nwhether that evidence satisfies the approximate-balance standard, without deference to the VA\u2019s own conclusions. \nThis analysis\u2014which \u201chas both legal and factual compo-\nnents,\u201d ante, at 11\u2014is plainly analogous to the sufficiency -\nof-evidence and probable-cause questions that appellate courts regularly review de novo . \nB \nThe majority dismisses these compelling parallels on the \ngrounds that assessing the sufficiency of the evidence or de-\ntermining the existence of probable cause are more \u201clegal\u201d \nthan the approximate-balance inquiry.  Ante , at 14\u201315.  The \nmajority further emphasizes that evaluating whether the evidence is approximately balanced for \u00a75107(b) purposesis a \u201cfact intensive\u201d inquiry that is better left to the \u201ctribu-\nnal below\u201d than the appeals court. Ante , at 12\u201313.  It also \nunfurls a surplusage argument of its own: If de novo  review \napplies to the VA\u2019s approximate-balance determination, the\nmajority says, then subsection (b)(1) is superfluous underpetitioners\u2019 interpretation because that determination \n\u201cwould have been subject to de novo  review even before the \nenactment of \u00a77261(b)(1).\u201d  Ante , at 16. \nNone of this reasoning is pe rsuasive.  To start, the major-\nity\u2019s efforts to distinguish sufficiency and probable-cause review from the approximate-balance inquiry fall flat.

Before the Vete rans Court can determine \nwhether the VA erred in deciding  that the positive and neg-\native evidence is not in \u201capproximate balance,\u201d it must first\nhave an understanding of what \u201cbalanced\u201d evidence looks \nlike in this context. Identifying \u201cbalance\u201d might involve ahypothetical and objective examination of the evidence\u2014\njust like a review of the sufficiency of the evidence or prob-\nable cause.  Imagine two doctors testify in favor of a claim-\nant\u2019s diagnosis and two doctors testify against it.  Does the \nmere fact that the same number of witnesses are presentedon both sides mean that the evidence is \u201cbalanced,\u201d as a le-\ngal matter?  The Veterans Co urt would need to develop a \nlegal rule to decide. It would also need to decide how the quality  of the evidence factors in: What if one of the doctors \nis the Nobel laureate who discovered the condition at issue \nwhile others are recent medical-school graduates?  Does the \ntestimony of a doctor who has examined the claimant bal-\nance evenly against one who has not? \nIt is thus quite likely that legal standards will need to be\ndeveloped to govern the a ssessment of \u201capproximate bal-\nance\u201d\u2014which is why the majority is wrong to contend that\nresolving approximate-balance challenges will rarely pro-\nduce generally applicable precedents.

No. 387, \n46th Cong., 3d Sess., 132\u2013133 (1881) (testimony of a Bureau\nof Pensions physician explaining that when the evidence\nleft \u201croom for doubt\u201d regarding the extent of a veteran\u2019s dis-\nability, the practice was to \u201cgive him the benefit of the\ndoubt\u201d if \u201che appear[ed] like an honest man\u201d).  In any event,the majority does not explain why the statutory-versus-\nconstitutional distinction has any rational bearing on the \namount of deference the Veterans Court owes to the VA\u2019s \nbenefit-of-the-doubt determinations. \nSpeaking of statutes, it is also significant that, under the\njudicial review scheme Cong ress has crafted for veterans\u2019 \nbenefits claims, the Veterans Court is no ordinary appellatetribunal. The thrust of the majority\u2019s reasoning seems to be that, as an \u201cappellate court,\u201d the Veterans Court should\ndo what appeals courts typica lly do: defer to the lower tri -\nbunal\u2019s assessment of these \u201c \u2018case-specific factual issues.\u2019 \u201d  \nAnte , at 13.

What is more, \nthe Veterans Court is \u201can Article I tribunal\u201d that Congress\nplaced within \u201ca unique administrative scheme.\u201d  Id ., at \n437\u2013438. Such tribunals often deve lop \u201cspecial \u2018expertise\u2019 \u201d \nthat guides them \u201c \u2018in making complex determinations in a \nspecialized area of the law.\u2019 \u201d  Sanders, 556 U.

This feature distinguishes the Veterans Court \nfrom Article III appellate courts because it gives that court the \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201cexpertise,\u201d Anderson, 470 U.

S., at 412\u2014such as \nwhether the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies.\nConsidering these unique features of the Veterans Court\nand the legal landscape in whic h it operates, there is good\nreason to believe that the Veterans Court is actually \u201cbetter \nsuited to resolve\u201d the approximate-balance inquiry than the \nVA itself. U. S. Bank , 583 U. S., at 395.  This is especially\nso given the need for fairness and consistency in the appli-cation of the \u201capproximate balance\u201d standard.\nThus, even though review of the VA\u2019s approximate-\nbalance determination requires applying a legal standardto a set of facts, the Veterans Court is well equipped to do\nso, and de novo  review of the VA\u2019s determination best pro-\nmotes the \u201csound administration of justice.\u201d Miller , 474 \nU. S., at 114. In concluding otherwise, the majority mini -\nmizes the \u201csingular characteristics\u201d of the review scheme atissue, Henderson , 562 U. S., at 440, and disregards Con-\ngress\u2019s choice to task the Veterans Court with ensuring that\nthe VA complies with the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nFinally, because \u00a77261(a) unquestionably authorizes \nde novo  review of questions of law, the majority contends\nthat applying de novo  review to the VA\u2019s approximate-\nbalance determinations would render subsection (b)(1) su -\nperfluous.

COLLINS \nJACKSON , J., dissenting \nwas always clear that an approximate-balance challenge\nraises a legal question (an assumption belied by the very \nholding that the majority announces today). Quite to the contrary, before Congress ena cted subsection (b)(1) to re-\nquire that the Veterans Court \u201ctake due account\u201d of theVA\u2019s benefit-of-the-doubt determinations, that court\u2014erro-\nneously, in my view\u2014reviewed benefit-of-the-doubt chal-\nlenges with deference. See supra, at 3\u20134, 10. Properly un-\nderstood, subsection (b)(1) accomplishes the clear and\nimportant mission of abrogating the Federal Circuit and \nVeterans Court cases requiring such deference.  The major-\nity simply ignores this point. See ante, at 16\u201317. \n* * * \nIn response to complaints that the Veterans Court was \nnot doing enough to ensure that the VA was, in fact, giving\nthe benefit of the doubt to ve terans, Congress inserted into\na demonstrably pro-claimant ad ministrative scheme the re-\nquirement that the Veterans Court \u201ctake due account\u201d of the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.\n\u00a77261(b)(1). The reading that the majority adopts today re-\nduces that provision to a rhetorical flourish and all but en-\nsures that the Veterans Court will continue rubberstamp-\ning the VA\u2019s application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. \nIf the majority\u2019s holding is correct, then \u201cCongress went\nthrough an awful lot to achieve relatively little.\u201d  Wilkinson \nv. Garland , 601 U. S. 209, 227 (2024) (J\nACKSON , J., concur-\nring in judgment).  The far better reading of this statute\u2014one that fully comports with the text, structure, context, \nhistory, and purpose of the provision Congress wrote\u2014is\nthat the Veterans Court must review without deference the \nVA\u2019s approximate-balance determination, and thereby fully \nassess that agency\u2019s compliance with Congress\u2019s com-\nmands.",

          "task_beliefs": "My prior beliefs had evolved to a state of \"known unknowns,\" where I had a comprehensive model of the petitioner's legal arguments but recognized a critical void regarding the respondent's (the United States') position. I had specifically identified four key questions that the government's Brief in Opposition needed to answer for me to build a balanced predictive model. The observation of that brief has now filled this void, transforming my understanding from a one-sided hypothesis into a complete map of the legal battlefield. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) have been substantially updated with the government's direct counter-arguments.\n\nMy beliefs now incorporate the following parameters, integrating the government's position with the petitioner's known arguments:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict (Now Fully Defined):** The conflict is not just about two statutes, but about two fundamentally different views of what it takes for a benefits statute to displace the Barring Act's default framework.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** The CRSC statute creates a self-contained system for determining the amount due, which functionally constitutes a \"settlement\" procedure under the broad definition from *Illinois Surety Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Peeler*.\n    *   **Government's View (New Information):** The government argues for a sharp distinction between establishing a *substantive entitlement* (which the CRSC statute does) and providing a *procedural mechanism to settle claims for unpaid amounts* (which, it argues, the CRSC statute does not do). The authority for the latter, according to the government, defaults to the Barring Act.\n\n*   **The Battle over Precedent (*Illinois Surety*):** My previous belief was that the government might try to distinguish or narrow *Illinois Surety*. The reality is more subtle and reveals their core strategy.\n    *   **Government's Strategy (New Information):** The government does not attack *Illinois Surety*. Instead, it co-opts the precedent, adopting its definition of \"settle\" as a \"final administrative determination regarding the government\u2019s total liability on a claim.\" It then argues that the CRSC statute's process\u2014which determines initial eligibility and monthly payment amounts\u2014is not a process for determining total liability on a *claim for past-due funds*. The government contends the words \"settle\" and \"claim\" are absent from the CRSC statute, which is strong evidence it does not create the kind of settlement process envisioned by *Illinois Surety* or required to displace the Barring Act.\n\n*   **The Government's Defense of the Federal Circuit's Test (New Information):** I previously questioned how the government would justify the Federal Circuit's two-part test (requiring the word \"settle\" or a separate limitations period). The brief provides a clear answer.\n    *   The test is not presented as a rigid, newly invented rule, but as a practical application of the well-established canon that waivers of sovereign immunity require a clear statement from Congress.\n    *   The government provides concrete examples of statutes that *do* displace the Barring Act (e.g., the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Military Claims Act), noting they use explicit terms like \"settle\" and often include their own limitations periods. This is presented as evidence of how Congress acts when it intends to create a separate settlement scheme, a standard the CRSC statute fails to meet.\n\n*   **The Hierarchy of Interpretive Canons (New Information):** My prior model anticipated a clash between the pro-veteran canon and the sovereign immunity canon. The government's brief signals its strategic choice in this clash.\n    *   The government's argument is built entirely on the foundation of the sovereign immunity canon (requiring a clear statement to waive limitations periods against the U.S.).\n    *   Crucially, the Brief in Opposition *completely ignores* the pro-veteran canon. This is a powerful signal that the government believes the sovereign immunity canon is dispositive in this context and that the pro-veteran canon is irrelevant to the structural question of which statute's limitations period applies.\n\n*   **Rebuttal of Petitioner's Structural Arguments (New Information):** I had noted the petitioner's argument that the Federal Circuit's ruling would disrupt other benefits schemes. The government directly refutes this.\n    *   The government argues that the petitioner's \"parade of horribles\" is unfounded because other statutes, like the Back Pay Act, *are* textually different and *do* contain specific language that can be read as creating a separate settlement process. This move attempts to isolate the CRSC statute as textually deficient while reassuring the Court that a ruling for the government will not cause widespread administrative chaos.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has now reached a crucial stage of maturity. The informational asymmetry is resolved. I have moved from understanding one side's strategy to understanding the direct points of collision between both parties. The key predictive factors are now clear: the Supreme Court's decision will likely turn on whether it accepts the government's sharp distinction between \"substantive entitlement\" and \"claim settlement,\" and which interpretive canon\u2014the sovereign immunity canon's demand for a clear statement or the petitioner's pro-veteran, functionalist approach\u2014it deems paramount in this statutory context.",

The central predictive question was how the Supreme Court would weigh these competing interpretive methodologies and which canon\u2014the petitioner's pro-veteran canon or the government's sovereign immunity canon\u2014would be deemed paramount. The latest observation, containing a recent, highly analogous Supreme Court opinion, provides powerful evidence on this exact point, moving my beliefs from a map of the conflict to a data-driven forecast of its likely outcome.\n\nMy beliefs have been updated with the following parameters, which build directly upon my previous understanding:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict (Now Viewed Through a Precedential Lens):** The conflict between the petitioner's functionalist view and the government's clear-statement rule remains the core of the case. However, the recent Supreme Court decision in *Bufkin v. Collins* (a veterans' benefits case) provides a strong signal that the government's approach is highly favored by the current Court.\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable but Weakened):** The petitioner argues that the CRSC statute's detailed process for calculating benefits functionally creates a self-contained \"settlement\" procedure, displacing the Barring Act.\n    *   **Government's View (Stable and Strengthened):** The government argues that displacing a default rule like the Barring Act's time limit\u2014a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity\u2014requires a clear statement from Congress, which is absent from the CRSC statute's text. The reasoning in *Bufkin* provides direct support for this interpretive method.\n\n*   **The Power of a \"Clear Statement\" (New, Strong Evidence):** The *Bufkin* opinion demonstrates the current Court's strong adherence to textualist and structural analysis in the context of veterans' benefits statutes.\n    *   **New Precedent (*Bufkin v. Collins*):** In *Bufkin*, the Court interpreted the statutory phrase \"take due account\" not as creating a new, more searching standard of judicial review, but as simply incorporating the existing standards. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Thomas, reasoned, \"Had Congress intended to impose a new standard of review... it would have clearly named a standard.\"\n    *   **Direct Analogy to *Soto*:** This logic is directly analogous to the government's argument in *Soto*: If Congress had intended the CRSC statute to displace the Barring Act's default limitations period, it would have used clear language to do so (e.g., the word \"settle\" or its own limitations period), as it has in other benefits statutes. The *Bufkin* decision suggests a broad, cross-ideological majority of the Court finds this \"clear statement\" reasoning highly persuasive.\n\n*   **The Hierarchy of Interpretive Canons (Now Clarified):** My previous model identified a clash between the pro-veteran and sovereign immunity canons. *Bufkin* provides crucial insight into how the Court prioritizes them.\n    *   **Sovereign Immunity Canon's Primacy (New Evidence):** The *Bufkin* majority, while acknowledging the pro-veteran purpose of the underlying \"benefit of the doubt\" rule, applied a strict, neutral textual analysis to the separate statute governing judicial review. This strongly suggests the Court treats structural/procedural statutes\u2014especially those involving waivers of sovereign immunity like the Barring Act\u2014as being governed by \"super-strong\" canons like the demand for a clear statement.\n    *   **Pro-Veteran Canon's Role (Refined Belief):** The pro-veteran canon is not irrelevant, but its power appears to be confined to resolving ambiguities within a *substantive* benefits-granting statute. It does not appear to be powerful enough to override a structural default rule or resolve a conflict *between* two statutes where sovereign immunity is at play. The government's strategy in *Soto* of focusing exclusively on the sovereign immunity canon and ignoring the pro-veteran canon now appears to be exceptionally well-aligned with the Court's demonstrated methodology.\n\n*   **The Majority's Composition (New Signal):** The 7-2 majority in *Bufkin* is itself a significant piece of data. The fact that Justices Kagan and Sotomayor joined the textualist-driven majority opinion indicates that this approach is not a simple conservative/liberal split. It represents a broad consensus on statutory interpretation methodology that makes a similar outcome in *Soto* more likely. The dissent from Justices Jackson and Gorsuch shows the argument is not frivolous, but the breadth of the majority is a more powerful predictive signal.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved from understanding the arguments to having concrete, recent evidence of how the current Supreme Court is likely to process those arguments. The observation of the *Bufkin* opinion significantly reduces my uncertainty. It provides a strong inferential basis to predict that the Court will favor the government's textualist, clear-statement argument. The path to a ruling for the United States now appears much clearer, as it aligns with a recently articulated and broadly supported interpretive methodology used by the Court in a highly analogous case. The key predictive factor is no longer just *which* canon the Court will choose, but the Court's demonstrated preference for applying the sovereign immunity canon's clear-statement requirement to structural/procedural questions, even in the pro-claimant context of veterans' benefits.",
