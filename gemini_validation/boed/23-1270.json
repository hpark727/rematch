    "facts_of_the_case": "Riley entered the U.S. on a tourist visa in 1995. In 2006, he was indicted and later convicted of marijuana distribution and firearm charges, receiving a 25-year sentence. After being granted compassionate release in January 2021, immigration authorities took him into custody and ordered his removal due to his aggravated felony conviction. Though Riley expressed fear of returning to Jamaica, leading to various proceedings regarding potential persecution and torture claims, he ultimately was only eligible for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). While an immigration judge initially granted this relief, the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed the decision in May 2022 and ordered Riley\u2019s removal to Jamaica. Riley petitioned for review, and his case was temporarily held pending the resolution of Martinez v. Garland. In Martinez, the U.S. Court Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that an order denying CAT relief is not a final order of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Relying on Martinez, the Fourth Circuit dismissed Riley\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

To form a predictive model, I must understand the petitioner's arguments, their interpretation of the statute, and, crucially, their assertion of a circuit split, which is a primary driver for the Court granting certiorari. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the primary source for all of this information. \n\nTask EIG is 0.9 because reading the petition will dramatically shift my beliefs from a general understanding to a specific, argument-based one. It will directly answer the question I posed in my current state: 'is there a circuit split?' This is a critical variable for predicting the outcome. \n\nDesign EIG is 0.7 because this action validates a core tenet of SCOTUS prediction strategy: start with the petitioner's framing of the case. Successfully using the petition to build a foundational understanding reinforces the high value of this step in my general methodology for all future cases.

After the Board of Immigration Appeals issued \na decision reversing an immigration judge\u2019s grant of \nrelief, Riley promptly petitioned for review by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Although \nboth parties urged the court to decide the merits of the \ncase, the Fourth Circuit dismissed Riley\u2019s petition for \nlack of jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), \nwhich states \u201c[t]he petition for review must be filed \nnot later than 30 days after the date of the final order \nof removal.\u201d    \nThis holding implicates two circuit splits, each of \nwhich independently warrants review. \n1.\nWhether 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline\nis jurisdictional, or merely a mandatory\nclaims-processing rule that can be waived or\nforfeited.\n2.\nWhether a person can obtain review of the\nBIA\u2019s decision in a withholding-only proceed-\ning by filing a petition within 30 days of that\nBIA decision?\n\nii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis petition arises from Riley v.

The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (App., infra, 7a-14a) and the immi-\ngration judge (App., infra, 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fourth Circuit entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1).   \nSTATUTORY, TREATY, AND REGULATORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) states in relevant part: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (stat-\nutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of \ntitle 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and \nsections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for \nreview filed with an appropriate court of appeals \nin accordance with this section shall be the sole \nand exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under the United Nations Conven-\ntion Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment, except as provided in subsection (e). \n\n2 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) states:  \nThe petition for review must be filed not later \nthan 30 days after the date of the final order of \nremoval. \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) states:  \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitu-\ntional and statutory provisions, arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove an \nalien from the United States under this subchap-\nter shall be available only in judicial review of a \nfinal order under this section.  \n8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1) states:  \nA court may review a final order of removal only \nif * * * the alien has exhausted all administrative \nremedies available to the alien as of right.  \n8 U.S.C. 1228(b) states: \n(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an \nalien described in paragraph (2), determine \nthe deportability of such alien under section \n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to con-\nviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an \norder of removal pursuant to the procedures \nset forth in this subsection or section 1229a of \nthis title. \n(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the \nalien\u2014 \n(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence at the time at which proceedings \nunder this section commenced; or \n\n3 \n \n(B) had permanent resident status on a condi-\ntional basis (as described in section 1186a \nof this title) at the time that proceedings \nunder this section commenced. \n(3) The Attorney General may not execute any or-\nder described in paragraph (1) until 14 calen-\ndar days have passed from the date that such \norder was issued, unless waived by the alien, \nin order that the alien has an opportunity to \napply for judicial review under section 1252 of \nthis title. \n(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General un-\nder this subsection shall be in accordance with \nsuch regulations as the Attorney General shall \nprescribe. The Attorney General shall provide \nthat\u2014 \n(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the \ncharges and of the opportunity described \nin subparagraph (C); \n(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the govern-\nment) by such counsel, authorized to prac-\ntice in such proceedings, as the alien shall \nchoose; \n(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to \ninspect the evidence and rebut the \ncharges; \n(D) a determination is made for the record that \nthe individual upon whom the notice for \nthe proceeding under this section is served \n(either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the \nalien named in such notice; \n\n4 \n \n(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; \nand \n(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated \nby the same person who issues the \ncharges. \n(5) No alien described in this section shall be eli-\ngible for any relief from removal that the At-\ntorney General may grant in the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s discretion. \nU.N. Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 114, sets \nforth:  \nNo State Party shall expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d) or \nextradite a person to another State where there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he \nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture. \n8 C.F.R. 1208(e)(1) establishes, in relevant part, \nthat: \nPursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of \nany action, decision, or claim raised under the Con-\nvention [Against Torture] or that section, except as \npart of the review of a final order of removal pur-\nsuant to section 242 of the [Immigration and Na-\ntionality] Act. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe precedents of the Fourth Circuit prevent broad \nclasses of noncitizens from seeking judicial review of \nclaims under the Convention Against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n\n5 \nPunishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).  This outcome results from two \npersistent misinterpretations regarding jurisdiction \nand timing for petitions from the Board of Immigra-\ntion Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that are contrary to Congress\u2019s \nexpress intentions.  Each of these misunderstandings \nis the basis of an entrenched circuit split, inde-\npendently warranting this Court\u2019s review.   \nFirst, 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) requires a petition to be \nfiled within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d \nThe Fourth Circuit holds timely filing to be a jurisdic-\ntional prerequisite.  That holding deviates from the \nprecedents of at least two other circuits.  It is also con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s teachings over the past two dec-\nades, which have repeatedly admonished that dead-\nlines are ordinarily not jurisdictional. \nSecond, the Fourth Circuit holds that a BIA deci-\nsion solely addressing CAT claims, with removability \nresolved at an earlier stage in the immigration pro-\nceeding, cannot constitute a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d \nfor purposes of Section 1252(b)(1).  That holding pre-\ncludes judicial review of CAT claims for any nonciti-\nzen who lacks a colorable claim to non-removability, \nbecause the statute simultaneously bars judicial re-\nview until the administrative process is complete (i.e. \na BIA decision).  8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1).  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s doctrine is contrary to the precedents of at least \nfive other circuits, which hold the removal order does \nnot become \u201cfinal\u201d until completion of the administra-\ntive proceedings including resolution of claims under \nthe CAT.  The Fourth Circuit is joined only by the Sec-\nond Circuit, whose decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2d Cir. 2022), laid the ground-\nwork.  This position is mistaken as a matter of plain \ntext, because the statute says explicitly that an order \n\n6 \n \nof removal does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until the conclusion \nof BIA processes.  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B). \nMr. Riley is a Jamaican native who has lived in \nNew York City for nearly 30 years.  If he returns to \nJamaica, he faces a significant likelihood of being \nkilled by an influential local figure who has murdered \nseveral members of Riley\u2019s family and operates under \nthe government\u2019s aegis.  Riley had no colorable claim \nto cancellation of removal, because of a past criminal \nconviction.  But an immigration judge found Riley and \nhis documentary evidence credible and ruled his re-\nmoval should be deferred under the CAT.  Then the \nBIA, upon the government\u2019s appeal, reversed that de-\ncision.   \nThe government urged the Fourth Circuit to hear \nthe merits of the case.  The government has previously \nregarded the BIA\u2019s decision as marking the final order \nof removal, but the government said the Bhaktibhai-\nPatel decision obligated it to present the countervail-\ning possibility.  The government also explained (as did \nRiley) that the 30-day time limit should not be re-\ngarded as jurisdictional.  The Fourth Circuit resisted \nthe parties\u2019 entreaties, and concluded that Riley\u2019s fi-\nnal order of removal was the document issued at the \nbeginning of his case, not at the end.  Although Riley \nfiled his case within 30 days after the BIA decision, \nthat was 16 months after the initial document.  The \nFourth Circuit found that 16-month gap deprived it of \njurisdiction. \nThis case is a compelling vehicle for addressing \nboth questions.  The merits of Riley\u2019s case are strong, \nso much so that the Fourth Circuit granted a rare stay \nof his removal at the outset of the case.  A different \noutcome on either question would have allowed the \n\n7 \npanel to reach those merits.  In the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich differs on both questions presented, a nonciti-\nzen in comparable circumstances received judicial re-\nlief; there is ample reason to expect Riley would as \nwell, but for the Fourth Circuit\u2019s errors.  In particular, \nonce the 30-day deadline is recognized as nonjurisdic-\ntional, the Fourth Circuit can and should accept the \ngovernment\u2019s effort to waive the deadline. \nThe Fourth Circuit is wrong on both points, and \nboth are the basis of a substantial circuit split.  The \ndivide requires this Court\u2019s resolution.  Multiple \njudges have recognized the timeline should not be ju-\nrisdictional but have said they feel bound by Stone v. \nINS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995), a precedent under the pre-\n1996 statute, until this Court holds otherwise.  Multi-\nple courts have recognized the intractable split about \nwhat constitutes a final order of removal.  These prob-\nlems recur frequently in the mass of immigration ad-\njudications, and the issue is extraordinarily grave.  \nEven when the United States declines under domestic \npolicies to allow a noncitizen to stay, the CAT protects \nthe person from torture and death at the hands of the \nperson\u2019s original government.  The people who most \nneed that protection are exactly those whom the \nFourth Circuit excludes from judicial review.   \nI.\nSTATUTORY \nAND \nREGULATORY\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the Convention Against Torture, no coun-\ntry \u201cshall expel, return (\u2018refouler\u2019) or extradite a per-\nson to another State where there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.\u201d  CAT art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, \n1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  Congress implemented the CAT \n\n8 \n \nin the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998 (\u201cFARRA\u201d).  Pub. L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 2242, 112 \nStat. 2681-822 (1998).  The government has \u201cno dis-\ncretion to deny relief to a noncitizen who establishes \nhis eligibility,\u201d and \u201c[a] conviction of an aggravated \nfelony has no effect on CAT eligibility.\u201d  Moncrieffe v. \nHolder, 569 U.S. 184, 187 n.1 (2013). \nCongress instructed the Department of Justice \n(\u201cDOJ\u201d) to issue regulations for processing CAT \nclaims.  FARRA \u00a72242(b).  Those regulations say an \notherwise removable noncitizen must not be removed \nto a country where it is \u201cmore likely than not that he \n[] would be tortured.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2)-(3).  \u201cTor-\nture\u201d is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or \nsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted ... by or at the instigation of or with the ac-\nquiescence of a public official.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.18(a)(1).     \nIn general, the proceedings to remove a noncitizen \nfrom the country commence with a charging document \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), \n8 C.F.R. 1003.14.  The case goes before an immigra-\ntion judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who conducts an evidentiary hearing, \nfinds facts, and renders a conclusion about the noncit-\nizen\u2019s removability.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71240.10, 1240.12.  That de-\ncision includes not only an assessment whether the \nnoncitizen presents a valid defense to removal, but \nalso claims for other forms of relief, such as withhold-\ning of removal or protection under CAT.  See id. \n\u00a71240.12(c). \nTwo main categories of noncitizen are barred from \nvarious forms of relief through this process.  One cat-\negory is noncitizens who have responded to a removal \norder by leaving the country.  Upon reentry, the re-\n\n9 \n \nmoval order is reinstated, and \u201c[is] not subject to reo-\npening or review.\u201d  Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 \nU.S. 523, 534 (2021) (quoting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)).  \nAnother category is noncitizens who have been con-\nvicted of \u201caggravated felonies\u201d; these individuals are \ngenerally ineligible for discretionary relief such as \ncancellation of removal.  Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 187.1 \nFor these individuals, DHS initiates a proceeding un-\nder 8 U.S.C. 1228(b).  That proceeding includes a no-\ntice of intent and then, if the person\u2019s status under \nSection 1228(b) is established, a \u201cFinal Administra-\ntive Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(b), (d). \nFor both categories, DOJ regulations establish \nprocedures for handling their CAT claims.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.31.  That process commences, for the second cat-\negory (which includes Riley), \u201c[u]pon issuance of a Fi-\nnal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.31(a).  \nIf the noncitizen has expressed fear of returning to the \ncountry of removal, an officer conducts a reasonable-\nfear interview.  Id. \u00a71208.31(c)-(d).  If the officer finds \nreasonable fear of torture, the matter is referred to an \nIJ for withholding-only adjudication.  Id. \u00a71208.31(e).  \nThe IJ then holds an evidentiary hearing on the sub-\nstance of the CAT claim.  If the IJ finds the claim mer-\nitorious, the protection granted may be withholding of \nremoval or, for some individuals excluded from that \nrelief,2 deferral of removal.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71208.16(d), 1208.17. \n \n1 \u201cAggravated felony\u201d is defined to include many kinds of of-\nfenses, including any felony under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  569 U.S. at 188.   \n2 The exclusions from withholding of removal overlap with, but \ndiffer from, the bars against discretionary removal discussed \nabove.  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(d)(2), (3). \n\n10 \nEither the United States or the noncitizen may \nappeal \nthe \nIJ\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nthe \nBIA. \n \nId.  \n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).  The BIA is a body of administrative\njudges with nationwide jurisdiction over immigration\nappeals.  Id. \u00a71003.1.  The BIA can, on such an appeal,\nonly review the IJ\u2019s decision regarding the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s \u201celigibility for withholding or deferral of removal\nunder 8 C.F.R. 1208.16,\u201d the provision that encom-\npasses CAT claims (and claims to asylum).  Id.\n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).\nThe individual can petition for circuit-court re-\nview of an adverse BIA decision.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1).  \n\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court \nof appeals in accordance with this section shall be the \nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under [CAT].\u201d  Id. \u00a71252(a)(4).

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, \nRespondent.\nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals.\nMarch 27, 2024, Submitted; \nApril 26, 2024, Decided\nBefore KING, HARRIS, and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit \nJudges.\nPetition dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this \ncircuit.\n\nAppendix A\n2a\nPER CURIAM:\nPierre Yassue Nashun Riley, a native and citizen of \nJamaica, petitions for review of an order of the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) vacating the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order granting Riley\u2019s application for \ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d) and ordering Riley removed to Jamaica. Because \nwe lack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review, we \ndismiss it.\nI.\nRiley entered the United States in 1995 on a tourist \nvisa. In 2006, a federal grand jury returned an indictment \ncharging Riley with conspiracy to distribute and possess \nwith intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of \nmarijuana and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a \ndrug-trafficking crime. A jury found Riley guilty of both \noffenses, and he was sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. \nIn January 2021, Riley was granted compassionate \nrelease.\nJust after Riley\u2019s release from federal prison, the \nimmigration authorities took custody of him. On January \n26, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued \na Final Administrative Removal Order, explaining that \nRiley was removable because he had been convicted of an \naggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). Riley expressed \na fear of returning to Jamaica, and an immigration officer \nconducted a reasonable fear interview. The immigration \nofficer determined that Riley had not established a \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nreasonable fear of persecution or torture in Jamaica, but \nan IJ disagreed and referred Riley to the immigration \ncourt for withholding-only proceedings.\nRiley appeared with counsel before the IJ and \nconceded removability under \u00a7 1228(b). Although Riley \napplied for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, \nand both withholding of removal and deferral of removal \nunder CAT, he later conceded that he was eligible only for \ndeferral of removal under CAT given his prior convictions.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the IJ granted Riley\u2019s \napplication for deferral of removal under CAT. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security appealed the IJ\u2019s \ndecision to the Board, and a three-member panel of \nthe Board issued a May 31, 2022, unpublished decision \nsustaining the appeal. That is, the Board vacated the \nIJ\u2019s order granting relief and ordered Riley removed to \nJamaica.\nOn June 3, 2022, Riley petitioned this court for review \nof the Board\u2019s decision. We later placed this appeal in \nabeyance for the issuance of the mandate in Martinez v. \nGarland, No. 22-1221 (4th Cir.). The mandate in Martinez \nhas issued, and so Riley\u2019s case has been removed from \nabeyance.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nII.\nA.\n\u201cWe have an independent obligation to assure ourselves \nof jurisdiction to decide an appeal.\u201d Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023). We generally possess \njurisdiction to review \u201ca final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1). A noncitizen must petition for review within \n30 days \u201cof the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(1). \u201cThe 30-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional \nand is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d Martinez, 86 F.4th \nat 566 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[O]nce we have \na final order of removal before us, we can consider along \nwith it \u2018all questions of law and fact . . . arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove [the] alien \nfrom the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(9)) (ellipsis and second alteration in original).\nRiley seeks review of the Board\u2019s order vacating \nthe IJ\u2019s order and denying his application for deferral \nof removal under CAT. We recently held in Martinez, \nhowever, that an order denying CAT relief is not a final \norder of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Id. at 567. \nSo for us to exercise jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order \ndenying CAT relief, Riley \u201cmust identify another eligible \norder\u201d that is properly before us. Id. But Riley cannot \ndo so because he did not timely petition for review of \na final order of removal. That is, Riley did not petition \nfor review within 30 days of the January 26, 2021, Final \nAdministrative Removal Order. So there is no final order \nof removal properly in front of us that would allow us to \n\nAppendix A\n5a\nreview the Board\u2019s order denying CAT relief. We thus \nlack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review. Id. at 571.\nB.\nRiley offers several arguments in favor of our \nexercise of jurisdiction, but none convinces us. To start, \nRiley contends that Martinez should not control in this \ncase because it involves a Final Administrative Order of \nRemoval issued under \u00a7 1228(b), not a reinstated removal \norder, which Martinez addressed. But Riley offers no \npersuasive justification for differentiating between those \ntwo types of orders when applying the jurisdictional \nprinciples delineated in Martinez, and we discern no \nreason to do so.\nRiley next argues that the Final Administrative Order \nof Removal was not actually final for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)\n(1) because he applied for asylum. Riley was statutorily \nineligible for asylum, however, and he effectively withdrew \nhis asylum application during his merits hearing. See 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Because Riley could not \nhave obtained asylum relief, his asylum application did \nnot impact his removability. The Final Administrative \nOrder of Removal was thus in fact final despite Riley\u2019s \nasylum application.\nFinally, Riley maintains that we may exercise \njurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order affirming the denial \nof CAT relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4) (\u201c[A] petition \nfor review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in \naccordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive \n\nAppendix A\n6a\nmeans for judicial review of any cause or claim under \n[CAT.]\u201d). But that provision means only that we may \nreview an order denying CAT relief as part of our review \nof a final order of removal. It does not authorize us to \nreview an order denying CAT relief without a final order \nof removal properly before us. See Nasrallah v. Barr, \n140 S. Ct. 1683, 1691, 207 L. Ed. 2d 111 (2020) (citing \u00a7 \n1252(a)(4) and explaining that order denying CAT relief \nis reviewable \u201cas part of the review of a final order of \nremoval\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Martinez, \n86 F.4th at 567 (recognizing that federal appellate court \nmay review order denying CAT relief only as part of its \nreview of final order of removal); Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180, 190 n.13 (2d Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat \u00a7 1252(a)(4) does not enable federal appellate court to \nexercise jurisdiction over order denying CAT relief \u201cin the \nabsence of a judicially reviewable final order of removal\u201d).\nIII.\nBecause we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the petition \nfor review. We dispense with oral argument because the \nfacts and legal contentions are adequately presented in \nthe materials before this court and argument would not \naid the decisional process.\nPETITION DISMISSED\n\nAppendix B\n7a\nAPPENDIX B \u2014 OPINION OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS, \nFILED MAY 31, 2022\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nBOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\nMATTER OF:\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY, A097-534-840\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nOn Appeal from a Decision of the Immigration Court, \nArlington, VA\nBefore: Baird, Appellate Immigration Judge; Gorman, \nAppellate Immigration Judge; Wilson, Appellate \nImmigration Judge\nOpinion by Appellate Immigration Judge Wilson\nWILSON, Appellate Immigration Judge\nThe Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) has \nappealed from an Immigration Judge\u2019s July 27, 2021, \ndecision granting the applicant\u2019s request for protection \nunder the regulations implementing the Convention \n\nAppendix B\n8a\nAgainst Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).1 The applicant, a native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, has filed responses in opposition to \nDHS\u2019 appeal. The appeal will be sustained.\nWe review the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nfor clear error. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Questions of law, \ndiscretion and judgment, and all other issues, are reviewed \nde novo. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).\nThe applicant alleged before the Immigration Judge \nthat a man named \n a gang leader in \nhis former neighborhood in Kingston and a drug kingpin, \nwill torture or kill him upon his return to Jamaica. He \nalleges that \n killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins \nin 2008 and 2011 and has recently sent death threats to \nhis mother and sister because he believes the applicant \nwill seek retribution against him for killing his cousins \n(IJ at 8; Tr. at 47-48, 55-59; Exhs. 2, 6A).\nThe Immigration Judge found that based on the \napplicant\u2019s credible testimony and the background \ninformation in the case he has demonstrated that he faces a \nparticularized risk of torture and that it is more likely than \n1.\u2002  The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty \nDoc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (entered into force for United \nStates Nov. 20, 1994). The applicant\u2019s attorney stated that he is \nonly applying for deferral of removal under the CAT (Tr. at 33). The \nImmigration Judge found the applicant is not eligible for asylum, \nwithholding of removal under the INA or withholding of removal \nunder the CAT because he has been convicted of a particularly \nserious crime (IJ at 6). This finding has not been contested on appeal.\n\nAppendix B\n9a\nnot that \n will harm the applicant upon his return \nto Jamaica (IJ at 9-10). In addition, the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant credibly testified that \n \nhas influence with the neighborhood and the police, that \nthe applicant would be forced to register with the police \nand keep them informed of his movements, which would \nallow \n to know his whereabouts and that he will \nmore likely than not be tortured with the acquiescence of \nthe government (IJ at 10).\nDHS challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s positive \ncredibility determination (IJ at 4-6). Based on the \ndeferential clear error standard of review, we discern \nno clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination and will treat the applicant\u2019s testimony as \ncredible for purposes of this appeal.\nHowever, as explained more fully below, we discern \nclear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding what is likely to happen to the applicant upon \nhis removal to Jamaica, and we agree with DHS that the \napplicant has not met his burden of proof to show eligibility \nfor deferral of removal under the CAT. The applicant \nbears the burden to show that it is more likely than not \nthat he would be tortured in Jamaica by, or with the \nconsent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful \nblindness) of, a public official or an individual acting in \nan official capacity. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The \napplicant must make two distinct showings: (i) likely \nfuture mistreatment, i.e., that it is more likely than not he \nwill endure severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted; and (ii) that the likely future mistreatment will \n\nAppendix B\n10a\noccur at the hands of the government or with the consent \nor acquiescence of the government. Cruz-Quintanilla v. \nWhitaker, 914 F.3d 884, 886 (4th Cir. 2019). Importantly, an \napplicant cannot establish eligibility by stringing together \na series of suppositions to show that it is more likely than \nnot that torture will result where the evidence does not \nestablish that each step in the hypothetical chain of events \nis more likely than not to happen. Matter of J-F-F-, 23 \nI&N Dec. 912, 917-18 (A.G. 2006). An Immigration Judge\u2019s \nfindings regarding the likelihood of future harm and of \nacquiescence by the government (i.e., what is likely to \nhappen) are factual findings that the Board reviews for \nclear error. Whether that predicted future harm meets \nthe definition of torture and whether future governmental \nconduct meets the definition of consent or acquiescence \nare questions of law we review de novo. Turkson v. Holder, \n667 F.3d 523, 530 (4th Cir. 2012).\nDHS argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge \nerred in finding that the applicant showed he will more \nlikely than not be tortured and should have found that \nhe presented a speculative chain of events that would \nhappen to him. We agree. While the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant has shown a particularized risk \nof torture, this finding is based on speculative assertions \nby the respondent regarding \nThe applicant, who has been in the United States \nfor many years, claims that \n killed two of his \ncousins in Jamaica. But other than his testimony, which \nis not based on first-hand knowledge, there is no objective \ncorroborating evidence that \n killed his relatives \n\nAppendix B\n11a\nor why. Indeed, the grand jury indictment in California \nagainst \n states he was arrested on February 12, \n2010, on his way to pick up marijuana, and thus, he would \nhave been incarcerated in the United States at the time \nof the cousin\u2019s murder in 2011 (Exh. 6D). When asked \nhow he knows \n killed his cousins, he stated that \n and his gang members \u201cbrag about this stuff\u201d \n(Tr. at 51-52). Yet, the affidavits from the applicant\u2019s \nfamily make no mention of \n (Exh. 6). Nor do \nthe affidavits from the applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and \nstepfather mention \n when describing threats \nto kill the applicant they received in 2021 (Exh. 6B). The \nmother\u2019s affidavit states she received phone calls \u201cfrom \nindividuals who live in Jamaica threatening to kill [the \napplicant] on site should he come home\u201d and that neighbors \nreported to her that three masked men asked about the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts (Exh. 6B; Tr. at 68-69). The \napplicant\u2019s sister states in her affidavit that \u201cpeople\u201d have \nasked about him and unknown guys told her the applicant \nhas a green light on him but did not tell her why (Exh. 6B; \nTr. at 68-69). When the applicant was asked why \n \nhas any interest in harming him now and sees him as a \nthreat, the applicant testified \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the big question\u201d \nand that he will expect the applicant to retaliate against \n for his cousins\u2019 deaths because that is the \n\u201cJamaican lifestyle\u201d (Tr. at 47-48). Thus, the applicant\u2019s \nclaims that \n killed or ordered the killing of his \ncousins and is behind the threats his mother and sister \nreceived in 2021 are speculative.\nThe Immigration Judge also found that country \nconditions evidence supports the applicant\u2019s claim \n\nAppendix B\n12a\nbut cited generalized statements in the 2020 State \nDepartment Report regarding government human \nrights abuses, fatalities involving government security \nforces, allegations of torture of people in police custody, \nand insufficient action in addressing abuse and unlawful \nkillings by security forces (IJ at 8-9; Exh. 4C). The \nImmigration Judge did not explain and did not cite to \nany particular evidence of record corroborating the claim \nthat \n is an ex-police officer, that he controls the \napplicant\u2019s old neighborhood, that he killed the applicant\u2019s \nrelatives, or that he poses a particularized risk of harm to \nthe applicant that would amount to torture. The country \nconditions evidence does not mention \n and does \nnot indicate the police will acquiesce in torture. In fact, the \nevidence the applicant cites in his brief on appeal is either \ninformation about crime and safety for foreign travelers to \nJamaica or evidence indicating that crime is a significant \nproblem, but the evidence also indicates that Jamaica \nhas an independent police oversight body and that efforts \nare made to address gangs, corruption, and impunity for \npolice killings (Exh. 6 at pages 142-52, 158-64). Moreover, \nthe mother\u2019s affidavit does not demonstrate a likelihood \nof acquiescence simply because the police stated it would \nnot investigate threats from unknown persons against the \napplicant who currently is not in Jamaica (Exh. 6B). The \nmere existence of a pattern of human rights violations \nin a particular country does not constitute a sufficient \nground for finding that a person would more likely than \nnot be tortured. Nolasco v. Garland, 7 F.4th 180, 191 (4th \nCir. 2021).\n\nAppendix B\n13a\nThus, we conclude that the respondent\u2019s claim is \nbased on the stringing together of a series of suppositions \nand is not supported by sufficient objective evidence to \ncorroborate his speculative fear of torture by \n or \nthat the government will acquiesce in his torture. Matter \nof O-R-E-, 28 I&N Dec. 330, 350 (BIA 2021); Matter of \nJ-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917-18.2\nFor these reasons, we will reverse the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s determination that the applicant has demonstrated \nthat it is more likely than not that he would be subjected \nto torture inflicted by, or at the instigation of or with the \nconsent, acquiescence, or willful blindness of a Jamaican \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nfor purposes of deferral of removal under the CAT.\n2.\u2002  The applicant also alleges in his reply brief that the \nImmigration Judge did not consider, in the aggregate, the likelihood \nof torture because of his status as a criminal deportee and his long-\ntime residence in the United States (Respondent\u2019s Reply Br. at 22-\n24). However, the Immigration Judge found that the applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly (IJ at 7). The applicant \nstates he will be required to register with the government and wear \nan ankle monitor and cites evidence stating that criminal deportees \nare stigmatized (Exh. 6 at 263-303, 310-25). However, he has not \ncited specific evidence that police or other government officials \nsubject criminal deportees to extreme mistreatment, intentionally \ninflict torture on them, or that he personally faces a risk of torture \nby the government or with the consent or acquiescence of a public \nofficial. The evidence he cites does not mention torture of criminal \ndeportees, but rather discusses the difficulty criminal deportees \nhave reintegrating into society and the blame they experience by \nsociety and the government for rising crime rates (Exh. 6). Thus, \nwe find this claim to be without merit.\n\nAppendix B\n14a\nAccordingly, the following orders will be entered.\nORDER: The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \nappeal is sustained.\nFURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge\u2019s order \ndated July 27, 2021, granting deferral of removal under \nthe CAT is vacated, and the applicant is ordered removed \nfrom the United States to Jamaica.\n\nAppendix C\n15a\nAPPENDIX C \u2014 DECISION AND ORDER OF THE \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION \nCOURT, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, \nDATED JULY 27, 2021\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nUNITED STATES IMMIGRATION COURT\nARLINGTON, VIRGINIA\nFile: A097-534-840\nIn the Matter of\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nJuly 27, 2021\nCHARGES:\nAPPLICATIONS: \t For m I- 5 89, application for \nwithholding of removal under INA \nSection 241(b)(3), and under the \nConvention against Torture.\n\nAppendix C\n16a\nORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nApplicant is a native and citizen of Jamaica. He \nlast entered the United States on a visitor visa in 1995; \noverstayed. While in the United States he was arrested \ntwice. First in 1998 for marijuana possession as a minor, \nyouthful offender, and then in 2006 he was convicted for \ndistribution of marijuana and possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of that distribution and then was sentenced to \n25 years\u2019 incarceration. Fast forward to 2021, the District \nCourt Judge signed an order authorizing compassionate \nrelease, and thereafter he was placed in ICE custody \nand was ordered removed pursuant to INA Section \n238(b). And then he claimed a reasonable fear which an \nImmigration Judge found to be reasonable and placed in \nthese proceedings.\nSUMMARY OF RELEVANT TESTIMONY\nApplicant was born on March 22, 1979, native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, lived in Kingston. He did use an alias, \nAdrian Francis for ID and to get into certain bars and \nclubs, what have you. He last entered the United States \nunder his real name on February 3, 1995 and never left. \nHe testified to having distributed marijuana in the past, \nacknowledged that he was convicted and sentenced to 25 \nyears. Ultimately he was released. He said if he returned \nto Jamaica he would be tortured and killed by a man \nnamed \n\nAppendix C\n17a\nThis person, \n he is from the \nneighborhood of Central Kingston, Jamaica, same \nneighborhood as the applicant. In fact, applicant said he \nknew \n His family knew him growing up. \nApplicant said that \n took over the neighborhood \nsometime in the 2000\u2019s. He was an ex-cop, supporter of the \nJLP Party, and after he took over the neighborhood he and \nhis supporters in the neighborhood would harm people and \nproperty. Applicant testified that at one point \n \neven came to the United States but he still had contacts \nin his old neighborhood in Jamaica, including authorities. \nApplicant testified that \n was deported back to \nJamaica from the United States sometime in 2016 or \n2017. He knows because the applicant\u2019s mother and sister \nstill live in Jamaica. They have seen \n Applicant \ntestified also that \n has an issue with his family. \nHe had killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins, a person \nnamed O\u2019Neal, as well as a person named Darrel, and \nthen threatened all male relatives which includes the \napplicant, that he would kill them or threaten to kill them \nif they return or if he sees them in Jamaica. And this is \nbecause, according to the applicant, \n feels that \nthe relatives of the two people that he murdered would \nexact revenge for the murders against \n Now, \n wants to harm the applicant because he thinks \napplicant is going to seek revenge against him.\nRegarding these two cousins who died, one was \nO\u2019Neal, he died in 2008. He was actually somewhat \nassociated with \n He used to give money to him to \npay off groups, individuals and politics. But when O\u2019Neal \nwanted to quit doing this \n killed him because he \n\nAppendix C\n18a\ntook that as a sign of disrespect. Applicant said that the \npolice did nothing to investigate or solve O\u2019Neal\u2019s murder. \nAnd in fact, when his other cousin, Darrel Scott, tried to \nget the police to investigate further, \n ordered him \nkilled, according to word on the street. That was sometime \nin March 2011. The police, according to applicant, did not \ninvestigate Darrel\u2019s death.\nThe applicant, after serving 15 years in prison, \nwas released for his marijuana distribution conviction, \nfollowing a sentence reduction. Thereafter, his mother \nstarted receiving calls threatening to harm the applicant \nif he ever returned to Jamaica. Applicant said there was \neven a car with masked men who approached applicant\u2019s \nmother looking for the applicant in Jamaica. Applicant \ntestified that his mother then went to file a police report \nbut the police told applicant\u2019s mother that the applicant \nwas not even in Jamaica as among the reasons why they \nrefused to take the report. They also knew that the report \nwas against \n Applicant said that his \nmother was even approached at work by \n himself \nand threatened that he will kill the applicant. At this \npoint the applicant told his mother to stop reporting to \nthe police for fear of being killed. He said his sister also \nreceived communication from \n in Jamaica. They \nthreatened to harm the applicant. He said that the people \nwho approached his sister said they have the green light to \nmurder the applicant from \n Applicant \nalso testified as two other individuals who live in the same \nneighborhood as he did in Jamaica both died following \ndeportation back. He said he cannot relocate anywhere \nin Jamaica because Jamaican authorities force him to \n\nAppendix C\n19a\nregister upon his return, they would know where he is. \nThat would tie directly into \n and allow \n \nto easily become aware of where the applicant is located. \nThat and the entire country of Jamaica is about the size \nof New Jersey. It is fairly small.\nCross-examination he said at the interview that he \ngrew up in a neighborhood controlled by the JLP. But \nexplained that was just a point of fact, not like a choice that \nhe was making. He also clarified that he could be killed \nas a member or for being a supporter of the JLP because \nthat is just the way people are killed in Jamaica. There is \na lot of violence; a lot of it is political. And he indicated he \ndid not mean to claim that he was a member of the JLP \nor the family was a member of the JLP.\nLAW FINDINGS, ANALYSIS, CREDIBILITY, \nCORROBORATION\nWhen testimony is offered in support of an application \nfor relief the Court must consider whether such testimony \nis credible. INA Section 240(c)(4)(B). For applications filed \nafter May 11, 2005 provisions of the REAL ID Act govern \nthe credibility analysis. Making this determination the \nCourt considers the totality of the circumstances and \nall relevant factors. See id. Section 240(c)(4)(C). Matter \nof J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 2007). Generally, \nto be credible, testimony shall satisfactorily explain any \nmaterial discrepancies or omissions, INA Section 240(c)\n(4)(C).

The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (App., infra, 7a-14a) and the immi-\ngration judge (App., infra, 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fourth Circuit entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1).   \nSTATUTORY, TREATY, AND REGULATORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) states in relevant part: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (stat-\nutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of \ntitle 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and \nsections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for \nreview filed with an appropriate court of appeals \nin accordance with this section shall be the sole \nand exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under the United Nations Conven-\ntion Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment, except as provided in subsection (e). \n\n2 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) states:  \nThe petition for review must be filed not later \nthan 30 days after the date of the final order of \nremoval. \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) states:  \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, in-\ncluding interpretation and application of constitu-\ntional and statutory provisions, arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove an \nalien from the United States under this subchap-\nter shall be available only in judicial review of a \nfinal order under this section.  \n8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1) states:  \nA court may review a final order of removal only \nif * * * the alien has exhausted all administrative \nremedies available to the alien as of right.  \n8 U.S.C. 1228(b) states: \n(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an \nalien described in paragraph (2), determine \nthe deportability of such alien under section \n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to con-\nviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an \norder of removal pursuant to the procedures \nset forth in this subsection or section 1229a of \nthis title. \n(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the \nalien\u2014 \n(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence at the time at which proceedings \nunder this section commenced; or \n\n3 \n \n(B) had permanent resident status on a condi-\ntional basis (as described in section 1186a \nof this title) at the time that proceedings \nunder this section commenced. \n(3) The Attorney General may not execute any or-\nder described in paragraph (1) until 14 calen-\ndar days have passed from the date that such \norder was issued, unless waived by the alien, \nin order that the alien has an opportunity to \napply for judicial review under section 1252 of \nthis title. \n(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General un-\nder this subsection shall be in accordance with \nsuch regulations as the Attorney General shall \nprescribe. The Attorney General shall provide \nthat\u2014 \n(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the \ncharges and of the opportunity described \nin subparagraph (C); \n(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the govern-\nment) by such counsel, authorized to prac-\ntice in such proceedings, as the alien shall \nchoose; \n(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to \ninspect the evidence and rebut the \ncharges; \n(D) a determination is made for the record that \nthe individual upon whom the notice for \nthe proceeding under this section is served \n(either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the \nalien named in such notice; \n\n4 \n \n(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; \nand \n(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated \nby the same person who issues the \ncharges. \n(5) No alien described in this section shall be eli-\ngible for any relief from removal that the At-\ntorney General may grant in the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s discretion. \nU.N. Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 114, sets \nforth:  \nNo State Party shall expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d) or \nextradite a person to another State where there \nare substantial grounds for believing that he \nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture. \n8 C.F.R. 1208(e)(1) establishes, in relevant part, \nthat: \nPursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of \nany action, decision, or claim raised under the Con-\nvention [Against Torture] or that section, except as \npart of the review of a final order of removal pur-\nsuant to section 242 of the [Immigration and Na-\ntionality] Act. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe precedents of the Fourth Circuit prevent broad \nclasses of noncitizens from seeking judicial review of \nclaims under the Convention Against Torture and \nOther Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n\n5 \nPunishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).  This outcome results from two \npersistent misinterpretations regarding jurisdiction \nand timing for petitions from the Board of Immigra-\ntion Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that are contrary to Congress\u2019s \nexpress intentions.  Each of these misunderstandings \nis the basis of an entrenched circuit split, inde-\npendently warranting this Court\u2019s review.   \nFirst, 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1) requires a petition to be \nfiled within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d \nThe Fourth Circuit holds timely filing to be a jurisdic-\ntional prerequisite.  That holding deviates from the \nprecedents of at least two other circuits.  It is also con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s teachings over the past two dec-\nades, which have repeatedly admonished that dead-\nlines are ordinarily not jurisdictional. \nSecond, the Fourth Circuit holds that a BIA deci-\nsion solely addressing CAT claims, with removability \nresolved at an earlier stage in the immigration pro-\nceeding, cannot constitute a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d \nfor purposes of Section 1252(b)(1).  That holding pre-\ncludes judicial review of CAT claims for any nonciti-\nzen who lacks a colorable claim to non-removability, \nbecause the statute simultaneously bars judicial re-\nview until the administrative process is complete (i.e. \na BIA decision).  8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1).  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s doctrine is contrary to the precedents of at least \nfive other circuits, which hold the removal order does \nnot become \u201cfinal\u201d until completion of the administra-\ntive proceedings including resolution of claims under \nthe CAT.  The Fourth Circuit is joined only by the Sec-\nond Circuit, whose decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2d Cir. 2022), laid the ground-\nwork.  This position is mistaken as a matter of plain \ntext, because the statute says explicitly that an order \n\n6 \n \nof removal does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until the conclusion \nof BIA processes.  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B). \nMr. Riley is a Jamaican native who has lived in \nNew York City for nearly 30 years.  If he returns to \nJamaica, he faces a significant likelihood of being \nkilled by an influential local figure who has murdered \nseveral members of Riley\u2019s family and operates under \nthe government\u2019s aegis.  Riley had no colorable claim \nto cancellation of removal, because of a past criminal \nconviction.  But an immigration judge found Riley and \nhis documentary evidence credible and ruled his re-\nmoval should be deferred under the CAT.  Then the \nBIA, upon the government\u2019s appeal, reversed that de-\ncision.   \nThe government urged the Fourth Circuit to hear \nthe merits of the case.  The government has previously \nregarded the BIA\u2019s decision as marking the final order \nof removal, but the government said the Bhaktibhai-\nPatel decision obligated it to present the countervail-\ning possibility.  The government also explained (as did \nRiley) that the 30-day time limit should not be re-\ngarded as jurisdictional.  The Fourth Circuit resisted \nthe parties\u2019 entreaties, and concluded that Riley\u2019s fi-\nnal order of removal was the document issued at the \nbeginning of his case, not at the end.  Although Riley \nfiled his case within 30 days after the BIA decision, \nthat was 16 months after the initial document.  The \nFourth Circuit found that 16-month gap deprived it of \njurisdiction. \nThis case is a compelling vehicle for addressing \nboth questions.  The merits of Riley\u2019s case are strong, \nso much so that the Fourth Circuit granted a rare stay \nof his removal at the outset of the case.  A different \noutcome on either question would have allowed the \n\n7 \npanel to reach those merits.  In the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich differs on both questions presented, a nonciti-\nzen in comparable circumstances received judicial re-\nlief; there is ample reason to expect Riley would as \nwell, but for the Fourth Circuit\u2019s errors.  In particular, \nonce the 30-day deadline is recognized as nonjurisdic-\ntional, the Fourth Circuit can and should accept the \ngovernment\u2019s effort to waive the deadline. \nThe Fourth Circuit is wrong on both points, and \nboth are the basis of a substantial circuit split.  The \ndivide requires this Court\u2019s resolution.  Multiple \njudges have recognized the timeline should not be ju-\nrisdictional but have said they feel bound by Stone v. \nINS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995), a precedent under the pre-\n1996 statute, until this Court holds otherwise.  Multi-\nple courts have recognized the intractable split about \nwhat constitutes a final order of removal.  These prob-\nlems recur frequently in the mass of immigration ad-\njudications, and the issue is extraordinarily grave.  \nEven when the United States declines under domestic \npolicies to allow a noncitizen to stay, the CAT protects \nthe person from torture and death at the hands of the \nperson\u2019s original government.  The people who most \nneed that protection are exactly those whom the \nFourth Circuit excludes from judicial review.   \nI.\nSTATUTORY \nAND \nREGULATORY\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the Convention Against Torture, no coun-\ntry \u201cshall expel, return (\u2018refouler\u2019) or extradite a per-\nson to another State where there are substantial \ngrounds for believing that he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.\u201d  CAT art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, \n1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  Congress implemented the CAT \n\n8 \n \nin the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998 (\u201cFARRA\u201d).  Pub. L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 2242, 112 \nStat. 2681-822 (1998).  The government has \u201cno dis-\ncretion to deny relief to a noncitizen who establishes \nhis eligibility,\u201d and \u201c[a] conviction of an aggravated \nfelony has no effect on CAT eligibility.\u201d  Moncrieffe v. \nHolder, 569 U.S. 184, 187 n.1 (2013). \nCongress instructed the Department of Justice \n(\u201cDOJ\u201d) to issue regulations for processing CAT \nclaims.  FARRA \u00a72242(b).  Those regulations say an \notherwise removable noncitizen must not be removed \nto a country where it is \u201cmore likely than not that he \n[] would be tortured.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2)-(3).  \u201cTor-\nture\u201d is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or \nsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted ... by or at the instigation of or with the ac-\nquiescence of a public official.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.18(a)(1).     \nIn general, the proceedings to remove a noncitizen \nfrom the country commence with a charging document \nfrom the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), \n8 C.F.R. 1003.14.  The case goes before an immigra-\ntion judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who conducts an evidentiary hearing, \nfinds facts, and renders a conclusion about the noncit-\nizen\u2019s removability.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71240.10, 1240.12.  That de-\ncision includes not only an assessment whether the \nnoncitizen presents a valid defense to removal, but \nalso claims for other forms of relief, such as withhold-\ning of removal or protection under CAT.  See id. \n\u00a71240.12(c). \nTwo main categories of noncitizen are barred from \nvarious forms of relief through this process.  One cat-\negory is noncitizens who have responded to a removal \norder by leaving the country.  Upon reentry, the re-\n\n9 \n \nmoval order is reinstated, and \u201c[is] not subject to reo-\npening or review.\u201d  Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 \nU.S. 523, 534 (2021) (quoting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)).  \nAnother category is noncitizens who have been con-\nvicted of \u201caggravated felonies\u201d; these individuals are \ngenerally ineligible for discretionary relief such as \ncancellation of removal.  Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 187.1 \nFor these individuals, DHS initiates a proceeding un-\nder 8 U.S.C. 1228(b).  That proceeding includes a no-\ntice of intent and then, if the person\u2019s status under \nSection 1228(b) is established, a \u201cFinal Administra-\ntive Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(b), (d). \nFor both categories, DOJ regulations establish \nprocedures for handling their CAT claims.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.31.  That process commences, for the second cat-\negory (which includes Riley), \u201c[u]pon issuance of a Fi-\nnal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  Id. \u00a71208.31(a).  \nIf the noncitizen has expressed fear of returning to the \ncountry of removal, an officer conducts a reasonable-\nfear interview.  Id. \u00a71208.31(c)-(d).  If the officer finds \nreasonable fear of torture, the matter is referred to an \nIJ for withholding-only adjudication.  Id. \u00a71208.31(e).  \nThe IJ then holds an evidentiary hearing on the sub-\nstance of the CAT claim.  If the IJ finds the claim mer-\nitorious, the protection granted may be withholding of \nremoval or, for some individuals excluded from that \nrelief,2 deferral of removal.  Id. \u00a7\u00a71208.16(d), 1208.17. \n \n1 \u201cAggravated felony\u201d is defined to include many kinds of of-\nfenses, including any felony under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  569 U.S. at 188.   \n2 The exclusions from withholding of removal overlap with, but \ndiffer from, the bars against discretionary removal discussed \nabove.  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(d)(2), (3). \n\n10 \nEither the United States or the noncitizen may \nappeal \nthe \nIJ\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nthe \nBIA. \n \nId.  \n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).  The BIA is a body of administrative\njudges with nationwide jurisdiction over immigration\nappeals.  Id. \u00a71003.1.  The BIA can, on such an appeal,\nonly review the IJ\u2019s decision regarding the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s \u201celigibility for withholding or deferral of removal\nunder 8 C.F.R. 1208.16,\u201d the provision that encom-\npasses CAT claims (and claims to asylum).  Id.\n\u00a71208.31(g)(2)(ii).\nThe individual can petition for circuit-court re-\nview of an adverse BIA decision.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1).  \n\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court \nof appeals in accordance with this section shall be the \nsole and exclusive means for judicial review of any \ncause or claim under [CAT].\u201d  Id. \u00a71252(a)(4).  Simi-\nlarly, FARRA allows review of a CAT claim only \u201cas \npart of the review of a final order of removal pursuant \nto\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252.  FARRA \u00a72242(d).  The \u201cpetition for \nreview must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1).   \nSection 1252(a)(2)(C) declares that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding any other provision of law, ... no court shall \nhave jurisdiction to review any final order of removal \nagainst an alien who is removable\u201d on account of cer-\ntain criminal convictions, including aggravated felo-\nnies.  In Nasrallah v. Barr, the Court held this provi-\nsion does not restrict review of CAT claims for such \npersons, because the BIA\u2019s decision on a CAT claim \u201cis \nnot itself a final order of removal.\u201d  590 U.S. 573, 590 \n(2020).  Yet the statute also defines an \u201corder of de-\nportation\u201d not to be \u201cfinal\u201d until the BIA has affirmed \nthe order (or time for seeking BIA review has elapsed).  \n\n11 \n \n8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B).  Thus, the previous orders in the \ncourse of the administrative process would not be \u201cfi-\nnal orders of removal.\u201d \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nRiley is from Jamaica.  R. 271-273 (No. 22-1609, \nECF 24-1).  He entered the United States in 1995 on \na tourist visa, R. 137, and has lived in this country \nsince then.  He has seven children, all U.S. citizens.  \nR. 271-273.  In 2011, Riley was convicted of an earlier \nconspiracy to distribute marijuana (and of a related \nfirearms charge).  R. 623.  While in prison, Riley en-\nrolled in a variety of courses, completed his GED, \ngraduated summa cum laude with an associate de-\ngree, and tutored dozens of fellow inmates. R. 274; R. \n372; R. 380. In January 2021, the district court \ngranted him compassionate release because his diabe-\ntes put him at substantial risk from COVID-19 and \nbecause the court found the time he had served was \nsufficient punishment.  R. 363-366.  \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement immedi-\nately took Riley into custody for removal proceedings.  \nOn January 27, 2021, DHS served Riley a notice of in-\ntent to issue a removal order.  R. 827-R. 828.  One day \nlater, DHS issued a document titled \u201cFinal Adminis-\ntrative Removal Order\u201d (\u201cFARO\u201d) finding that Riley \nhad been convicted of an aggravated felony and must \nbe deported to Jamaica.  R. 825.   \nIn a subsequent reasonable-fear interview, Riley \nexplained that a particular drug kingpin, associated \nwith the Jamaican government, already ordered the \nmurder of several of Riley\u2019s relatives, and threatened \nto kill Riley upon his return.  R. 645-660.   \n\n12 \nIII.\nPROCEEDINGS BELOW\nRiley then filed a formal request for CAT relief.  At \nan evidentiary hearing before an IJ, Riley testified, \nand presented a range of documentary evidence along-\nside his testimony, as well as affidavits from relatives.  \nThe kingpin is a former police officer with strong con-\nnections with the Jamaican government and influence \nover the police.  R. 144-145.  After he ordered the kill-\ning of two of Riley\u2019s cousins, the Jamaican police did \nnot investigate those murders.  R. 145.  The kingpin \nhas threatened to kill all male members of the family, \nid., and men have approached family members still in \nJamaica to threaten Riley\u2019s murder when he arrives.  \nR. 146-147.\nThe IJ, finding Riley credible, determined that if \nRiley is sent to Jamaica, more likely than not the king-\npin will have him killed, with the acquiescence of that \ncountry\u2019s government.  R. 134-135.  Riley is not eligi-\nble for withholding of removal, due to his prior con-\nspiracy conviction, but the IJ ordered his removal de-\nferred pursuant to the CAT.  R. 135. \nDHS appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA.  R. 081-\n083. The BIA judge purported to accept the IJ\u2019s posi-\ntive determination of Riley\u2019s credibility, but proceeded\nto reverse the finding that Riley will more likely than\nnot be killed in Jamaica.  The BIA said it found no\n\u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d proving the past murders of\nRiley\u2019s relatives, and it held that Riley must prove\nthose past murders are also more likely than not, as\nwell as the predicted future killing.  R. 004-005.  The\nBIA criticized the IJ for demanding corroborating ev-\nidence for only parts of Riley\u2019s testimony.  Id.\n\n13 \n \nRiley promptly petitioned the Fourth Circuit for \nreview of the BIA\u2019s decision.  The Fourth Circuit \ngranted a stay of Riley\u2019s removal pending the disposi-\ntion of his petition.   \nMeanwhile, the Second Circuit decided Bhak-\ntibhai-Patel, which held that a CAT-only decision by \nthe BIA about a noncitizen with a reinstated removal \norder is not a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so that a peti-\ntion from that BIA decision is not within 30 days of a \n\u201cfinal order.\u201d  32 F.4th at 190-191.  The government\u2019s \nanswer brief in Riley\u2019s case acknowledged that \u201c[h]is-\ntorically, the Attorney General has taken the position, \nand the courts of appeals have agreed, that finality for \npurposes of judicial review is obtained only after the \ncompletion of all proceedings connected to a reinstate-\nment order, including the final disposition of any rea-\nsonable-fear or withholding-only proceedings.\u201d Gov't \nC.A. Br. 22 (No. 22-1609, ECF 33-1).  But in light of \nBhaktibhai-Patel, the government said it felt obli-\ngated to question that approach.  The government \nurged the court to review the merits of Riley\u2019s case \nwhile establishing a jurisdictional rule for future \ncases.  Id. at 28. \nIn May 2023, this Court decided, in Santos-Zaca-\nria v. Garland, that Section 1252(d)(1), allowing re-\nview only to a noncitizen who has exhausted adminis-\ntrative remedies, is not a jurisdictional limitation.  \n598 U.S. 411 (2023).  Riley then asked the Fourth Cir-\ncuit to conclude that the 30-day deadline (the time for \nfiling after a final order of removal) is also not juris-\ndictional.  The government agreed with that sugges-\ntion and urged the court again to decide the merits.   \nRiley C.A. 28(j) Ltr. (July 12, 2023). \n\n14 \nIn the meantime, the Fourth Circuit decided San-\ntos-Zacaria does not affect the Fourth Circuit\u2019s prece-\ndents about the 30-day deadline.  The doctrine that \nthe deadline is jurisdictional remains mandated by \nStone, the court concluded, and the court held that \nSantos-Zacaria had not overruled Stone.  Salgado v. \nGarland, 69 F.4th 179, 181 & n.1 (4th Cir. 2023).   \nIn November 2023, the Fourth Circuit decided to \nfollow Bhaktibhai-Patel, and held that an \u201can order \ndenying CAT relief is not a final order of removal for \npurposes of [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1252(a)(1),\u201d so that the court \nlacked jurisdiction to review a CAT order issued after \nwithholding-only proceedings.  Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 567 (4th Cir. 2023).  The Martinez peti-\ntioner promptly sought rehearing, and the Fourth Cir-\ncuit held Riley\u2019s case in abeyance pending the decision \non that rehearing request. \nAfter the court denied rehearing in Martinez, it \nproceeded to dismiss Riley\u2019s petition, in reliance on \nMartinez.  App., infra, 1a-6a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Court should grant certiorari to resolve two \nsplits that have divided the circuits on issues funda-\nmental to review of immigration matters, which make \nup a significant portion of circuit-court dockets.  First, \nthe Court should make clear that the Section \n1252(b)(1) deadline is not a jurisdictional limitation. \nThat conclusion follows from two decades of the \nCourt\u2019s reiterated teaching about what is truly juris-\ndictional.  But some circuit courts still feel themselves \nbound by Stone, and need this Court to issue a correc-\n\n15 \n \ntion.  Second, what constitutes the final order of re-\nmoval, in a withholding-only proceeding, has gener-\nated deep confusion in the lower courts.  That the \nsame case might lead to reversal in one circuit and \ndismissal in another is intolerable. \nI. THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED AND \nDEEP SPLIT ON THE QUESTIONS PRE-\nSENTED. \nThe circuits are profoundly divided on the ques-\ntions presented here. \nA. The circuits disagree whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is juris-\ndictional. \nThe Court has never directly addressed whether \nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline is a jurisdictional \nrule.  There is now a well-defined circuit split on this \nissue, demanding the Court\u2019s further clarification. \nStone arose under the predecessor provisions (be-\nfore a 1996 overhaul of the immigration statute).  The \nCourt addressed whether a reconsideration motion at \nthe agency would toll or restart the time for judicial \nreview.  514 U.S. at 405-06.  In concluding there is no \nsuch pause for reconsideration, the Court stated that \n\u201cstatutory provisions specifying the timing of review \n... are, as we have often stated, \u2018mandatory and juris-\ndictional.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 405.   \nStone did not address whether the deadline at is-\nsue could be waived by the government, as a truly ju-\nrisdictional prerequisite cannot be.  Arbaugh v. Y&H \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006).  Nor did Stone decide \nwhether Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline, at issue here, \nis jurisdictional; Section 1252(b)(1) was not enacted \n\n16 \n \nuntil a year later.  Pub. L. No. 104-208, \u00a7306(a)(2), (b), \n110 Stat. 3009-607, 3009-607.    \nNevertheless, circuit courts across the country \nthen applied Stone to conclude Section 1252(b)(1) also \nstates a \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d limitation.  \nMagtanong v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1190, 1191 (9th Cir. \n2007).  See Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. \n2003); Malvoisin v. INS, 268 F.3d 74, 76 (2d Cir. \n2001); Tshibonge v. Ashcroft, 81 F. App\u2019x 785, 786 (4th \nCir. 2003); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d \n672, 676 (5th Cir. 2003); Prekaj v. INS, 384 F.3d 265, \n267 (6th Cir. 2004); Sankarapillai v. Ashcroft, 330 \nF.3d 1004, 1006 (7th Cir. 2003); Skurtu v. Mukasey, \n552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008); Nahatchevska v. \nAshcroft, 317 F.3d 1226, 1227 (10th Cir. 2003); Da-\nkane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 371 F.3d 771, 774 n.3 (11th \nCir. 2004). \nSince then, the Court has concluded that courts \nhave overused the concept of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  In Ar-\nbaugh, the Court observed that \u201crecent decisions ... \nhave clarified that time prescriptions, however em-\nphatic, \u2018are not properly typed \u2018jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d  546 \nU.S. at 510.  In Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. \nShinseki, the Court declined to rely on Stone as au-\nthority that deadlines are usually jurisdictional.  To \nthe contrary, the Court explained, \u201c[f]iling deadlines, \n... are quintessential claim-processing rules\u201d that are \nnot jurisdictional.  562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011).  Then \nSantos-Zacaria stated explicitly that \u201cwe treat a rule \nas jurisdictional only if Congress clearly states that it \nis.\u201d  598 U.S. at 416.  The Court observed that Stone \nis inconsistent with the last two decades of precedent \n\u201cthat \u2018bring some discipline to the use of th[e] term ju-\nrisdictional.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 421.   \n\n17 \n \nIn the wake of Santos-Zacaria, five circuits have \nrevisited their precedents holding Section 1252(b)(1) \nis jurisdictional.  The Ninth Circuit and the Fifth \nCircuit have both now held that it is not, and that \nSantos-Zacaria abrogated their previous precedents.  \nAlonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1056 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023).  These circuits found the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) 30-day deadline \u201csuffers from the same \nflaw\u201d as the Court identified in Santos-Zacaria.  \nAlonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1047; Argueta-Hernandez, \n87 F.4th at 705.  Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is in the \nsame statute as Section 1252(d)(1), the provision that \nSantos-Zacaria deemed non-jurisdictional, and simi-\nlarly lacks language making it plainly jurisdictional.  \nId.  Accordingly, \u201calthough we previously relied on \nStone to hold that \u00a7 1252(b)(1) was a jurisdictional \nrule, that reasoning is now \u2018clearly irreconcilable\u2019 with \nthe Supreme Court's intervening reasoning in Santos-\nZacaria.\u201d  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1047. \nIn contrast, the Seventh Circuit adheres to its \nprior precedents that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing dead-\nline is jurisdictional.  F.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th \n620, 626 (7th Cir. 2024).  The Seventh Circuit was \n\u201caware that ... Santos-Zacaria v. Garland called the \njurisdictionality of \u00a7 1252(b)(1) into question, but it \ndid not directly overrule Stone.\u201d  Id.  \u201c[U]ntil Stone is \noverturned by the Court itself,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nholds, \u201cwe must continue to apply it.\u201d  Id. (citations \nomitted).3  The Eleventh Circuit reached a similar \n \n3 As discussed below, F.J.A.P. ultimately accepted jurisdiction \nover its petitioner\u2019s case, because the Seventh Circuit joined the \nmajority view about what constitutes a final order of removal in \na withholding-only case. \n\n18 \n \nconclusion in an unpublished decision.  Allen v. Att\u2019y \nGen., No. 23-13044, 2024 WL 164403, at *2 (11th Cir. \nJan. 16, 2024) (\u201c[W]e are obligated to follow [our prior \nprecedent] because Santos-Zacaria is not clearly on \npoint\u2026.\u201d). \nThe Fourth Circuit, similarly, believes Stone \nstill controls this issue.  Salgado enforced the 30-day \ndeadline as a jurisdictional limitation.  \u201cBecause the \nholding in Santos-Zacaria is limited to \u00a71252(d)(1) \nand the Supreme Court has not overruled Stone, we \nare bound to apply Stone unless and until the Su-\npreme Court provides to the contrary.\u201d  69 F.4th at \n181 n.1.  Martinez, too, enforced the 30-day deadline \nas a jurisdictional bar, on the basis of Stone.  86 F.4th \nat 572.  The court refused to entertain supplemental \nbriefing on the consequences of Santos-Zacaria, be-\ncause Salgado had already established that Stone re-\nmains binding.  Id. at 566 n.3.  Judge Floyd, concur-\nring in the judgment, noted that Santos-Zacaria \n\u201ccast[s] doubt on our characterization of the deadline \nas \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\u201d and \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d the 30-day \ndeadline is a claims-processing rule.  Id. at 574.  But \nhe \u201crecogniz[ed] this panel is bound by this Court\u2019s \nprevious treatment of \u00a71252(b)(1) as jurisdictional.\u201d  \nId. \nThus, there is now an established split on whether \nSection 1252(b)(1) states a jurisdictional limitation.  \nTwo circuits, the Fifth and the Ninth, hold that it \ndoes not.  Four circuits have, since Santos-Zacaria, \ncontinued to apply their prior precedents treating Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional, but without assessing \nthe impact of Santos-Zacaria.  See Valderamos-Ma-\ndrid v. Garland, No. 21-6221, 2023 WL 5423960, at *1 \n(2d Cir. 2023); Duenas v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 22-3024, 2023 \n\n19 \nWL 6442601, at *2 (3d Cir. 2023); Kolov v. Garland, \n78 F.4th 911, 917 n.4 (6th Cir. 2023); Arostegui-Mal-\ndonado v. Garland, 75 F.4th 1132, 1140 (10th Cir. \n2023).  Three circuits, the Fourth, the Seventh, and \nthe Eleventh, have explicitly concluded that Section \n1252(b)(1) remains jurisdictional notwithstanding \nSantos-Zacaria.   \nThis split will not disappear without the Court\u2019s \nintervention.  In F.J.A.P. and Martinez, the govern-\nment itself asked the courts to correct their precedent, \nbut they refused.  In this case, the government explic-\nitly asked the lower court to conclude the 30-day dead-\nline is non-jurisdictional, but to no avail.  At least \nseven judges\u2014the panels in F.J.A.P. and Salgado, \nand Judge Floyd in Martinez\u2014have said they need the \nCourt to overrule Stone before they can cease miscat-\negorizing Section 1252(b)(1).  In these courts where \nprecedent dictates clearly that Stone, from this Court, \nis binding on this issue and has not been overruled, no \nen banc rehearing is likely to reconsider that conclu-\nsion.  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing in \nMartinez.  Order, Martinez v. Garland, No. 22-1221 \n(4th Cir. Mar. 1, 2024).   \nB. The circuits disagree about when\nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline begins in withholding-only\ncases.\nUntil recently, every circuit agreed that Section \n1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline ran from the conclusion \nof agency withholding-only proceedings.  See Garcia \nv. Sessions, 856 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2017); Garcia-\nVilleda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir. 2008);\nBonilla v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 87, 90 n.4 (3d Cir. 2018);\n\n20 \n \nTomas-Ramos v. Garland, 24 F.4th 973, 980 n.3 (4th \nCir. 2022); Luna-Garcia de Garcia v. Barr, 921 F.3d \n559, 565 & n.4 (5th Cir. 2019); Martinez v. Larose, 968 \nF.3d 555, 563 (6th Cir. 2020); Garcia-Arce v. Barr, 946 \nF.3d 371 (7th Cir. 2019) Lara-Nieto v. Barr, 945 F.3d \n1054, 1058 (8th Cir. 2019); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 \nF.3d 955, 958 (9th Cir. 2012); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, \n777 F.3d 1182, 1186 (10th Cir. 2015); Jimenez-Mo-\nrales v. Att\u2019y Gen., 821 F.3d 1307, 1308 (11th Cir. \n2016).  That was also the government\u2019s view.  Gov\u2019t \nC.A. Br. 22.    \nBut Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez have caused \ntwo circuits to conclude their prior precedents are \noverruled, generating another split openly acknowl-\nedged among seven circuits. \nNasrallah \nexamined \nwhether \nSection \n1252(a)(2)(C)\u2019s bar \u201cprecluding judicial review of fac-\ntual challenges to final orders of removal\u201d also \u201cpre-\nclude[s] factual challenges to CAT orders\u201d during \nwithholding-only proceedings.  590 U.S. at 581.  The \nCourt concluded it does not, because a CAT decision is \nnot itself a final order of removal.  Id. at 582-583.  The \nCourt noted that Congress did not explicitly foreclose \njudicial review of CAT orders, and the Court said it \nwould not interpret the statute to do so implicitly.  Id. \nat 583.   \nIn Guzman Chavez, the Court decided the govern-\nment can detain noncitizens who were ordered re-\nmoved from the United States, later reentered the \ncounty without authorization, and sought withhold-\ning-only relief to prevent the government from execut-\ning those orders based on fears of returning to their \nhome country.  594 U.S. at 526.  The statute requires \n\n21 \n \nsuch detention when a removal is \u201cadministratively fi-\nnal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1231.  The Court concluded that a rein-\nstated removal order is \u201cadministratively final\u201d even \nthough withholding-only proceedings are pending.  Id. \nat 545-546.   \nThough Nasrallah said its analysis should not \u201caf-\nfect the authority of the courts of appeals to review \nCAT orders,\u201d 590 U.S. at 585, and Guzman Chavez \nsaid the Court was not expounding the meaning of \u201cfi-\nnal[ity]\u201d under Section 1252, 594 U.S. at 535 n.6, two \ncircuits have held that these decisions do in fact \nchange what counts as a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d start-\ning the 30-day clock.   \nThe Second Circuit and the Fourth Circuit \nhold that the BIA\u2019s decision in a withholding-only case \nis not a \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d; that \u201cfinal order\u201d \ncame at some past point, such as the FARO in Riley\u2019s \ncase or the reinstatement order in Martinez and \nBhaktibhai-Patel.  Bhaktibhai-Patel reasoned that \n\u201c[d]ecisions made during withholding-only proceed-\nings cannot qualify as orders of removal,\u201d per Nasral-\nlah, and therefore withholding-only orders are not fi-\nnal orders of removal for Section 1252(b)(1) purposes.  \n32 F.4th at 190-91.  According to the Second Circuit, \n\u201ca reinstatement decision becomes final once the \nagency's review process is complete,\u201d at which time \nthe 30-day filing window begins to run, and the court \ndoes not have jurisdiction under Section 1252(b)(1) to \nreview a final CAT decision if a petitioner waits until \ncompletion of withholding-only proceedings to appeal.  \nId. at 192-93.   \nMartinez followed that lead to conclude that, after \nNasrallah, withholding-only proceedings do not lead \nto a final order of removal.  The final order of removal \n\n22 \n \nmust have been issued some time previously, at the \noutset of the withholding-only proceedings.  86 F.4th \nat 567.  The proceedings below applied the same rea-\nsoning to Riley\u2019s withholding-only case arising from a \nFARO.  App., infra, 4a (\u201c[A]n order denying CAT relief \nis not a final order of removal for purposes of \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1).\u201d).  The court \u201cdiscern[ed] no reason\u201d to \n\u201cdifferentiat[e] between those two types of orders\u201d\u2014a \nreinstatement order or a FARO\u2014\u201cwhen applying the \njurisdictional principles delineated in Martinez.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 5a.  The court identified the FARO, which \nas explained above is the beginning of the withhold-\ning-only process, as the final order of removal in Ri-\nley\u2019s case.  App., infra, 4a. \nBecause withholding-only proceedings inevitably \ntake more than 30 days, a petition filed after the BIA\u2019s \ndecision in those proceedings will necessarily be later \nthan 30 days after the initial order that the Second \nand the Fourth Circuits deem the \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval.\u201d  Thus, such petitions will always fail the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) deadline, and\u2014under precedents in \nboth circuits\u2014be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \nThe Fourth Circuit and the Second Circuit are in \nthe minority on this issue.  Five other circuits\u2014the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Cir-\ncuits\u2014have all held that an order of removal does not \nbecome \u201cfinal,\u201d thus triggering the 30-day deadline, \nuntil the conclusion of the proceedings regarding CAT \nrelief.  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 638; Alonso-Juarez, 80 \nF.4th at 1056; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705-06; \nKolov, 78 F.4th at 919; Arostegui-Maldonado, 75 F.4th \nat 1143. \nThe Seventh Circuit, in an opinion by Judge St. \nEve, specifically rejected the reasoning in Martinez \n\n23 \n \nand Bhaktibhai-Patel and surveyed the decisions of \nthe Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits. F.J.A.P., \n94 F.4th at 629-30.  In viewing what it characterized \nas a \u201ccircuit split,\u201d the Seventh Circuit analyzed \nNasrallah and Guzman Chavez and concluded that \nneither decision determined the meaning of finality \nunder Section 1252(b)(1).  Id. at 631-33.  \nAccordingly, the Seventh Circuit engaged in a de-\ntailed analysis of the statutory text, after which it con-\ncluded that \u201c[o]nly when withholding proceedings are \ncomplete have \u2018the rights, obligations, and legal con-\nsequences of the reinstated removal order\u2019 been fully \nestablished.\u201d  Id. at 633-35 (citation omitted).  The \ncourt further emphasized that this \u201cplain meaning of \nthe statute comports with the principle of statutory \nconstruction that presumes congressional intent in fa-\nvor of judicial review,\u201d and that \u201cCongress ... explicitly \nprovided for judicial review of CAT orders.\u201d  Id. at 635.  \n\u201cAn interpretation that forecloses review of CAT or-\nders cannot stand; it directly contradicts the presump-\ntion of review, a presumption supported by the lan-\nguage of the [Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d  Id.   \n\u201cBased on the statutory language, structure, and \ncontext of \u00a7 1252,\u201d the Seventh Circuit held that it had \njurisdiction to hear the petition and proceed to the \nmerits because petitioner filed his petition within 30 \ndays of the completion of his CAT proceedings.  Id. at \n637-38.  \u201cOnly when those [CAT] proceedings con-\nclude, if the noncitizen is eligible for that review, has \nthe agency finalized all mandatory review and \u2018fully \ndetermined\u2019 the noncitizen\u2019s fate.\u201d  Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Gib-\nbons, also rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion in \nBhaktibhai-Patel that Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez \n\n24 \npreclude review of the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding-\nonly relief.  Kolov, 78 F.4th at 918.  The court empha-\nsized that its prior precedent was fully in line with \nNasrallah and Guzman Chavez.  Id. at 918-19.  The \nSixth Circuit had, even before Guzman Chavez, \u201cre-\njected the argument that the phrase \u2018administratively \nfinal\u2019\u201d\u2014the text that Guzman Chavez interpreted\u2014\n\u201cmeant the same thing as the phrase \u2018final order of \nremoval\u2019 (the phrase in \u00a7 1252(a)(1) that concerns ju-\ndicial review).\u201d  Id. at 919 (citation omitted).  The \ncourt therefore adhered to its prior precedent holding \nthat \u201can order about withholding of removal functions \nas a reviewable final order because such relief could \nforeclose an avenue of deportation if granted,\u201d and \nconcluded that \u201c[t]hese holdings are not clearly incon-\nsistent with Nasrallah and [Guzman Chavez] and \ntherefore remain binding.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  In \na concurrence, Judge Murphy explained various com-\nplications arising from Nasrallah and Guzman \nChavez.  He agreed \u201cwe should continue to follow our \ncurrent approach,\u201d but called for \u201cthe Supreme Court \nto decide\u201d the real consequences of its recent deci-\nsions.  Id. at 929 (Murphy, J., concurring). \nIn the Fifth Circuit, a panel that had originally \nchosen to follow Bhaktibhai-Patel subsequently re-\nheard the matter and reversed its own decision, com-\ning into line with the majority of circuits noted above.  \nArgueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 73 F.4th 300 (5th Cir. \n2023) (dismissing petition for lack of jurisdiction), \nwithdrawn and superseded, 87 F.4th 698 (5th Cir. \n2023).  The court then accepted its jurisdiction over a \npetition filed within 30 days after the BIA\u2019s decision \nin a withholding-only case, and the court reversed the \nBIA\u2019s decision.  87 F.4th at 714.   \n\n25 \nThe Ninth and Tenth Circuits share this view \nabout finality in withholding-only proceedings. \nAlonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1056 (holding that the Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) 30-day deadline was not triggered un-\ntil the conclusion of withholding-only proceedings); \nArostegui-Maldonado, 75 F.4th at 1143 (holding the \nsame). \nIn the Third Circuit, dueling unpublished opin-\nions have decided the issue both ways.  Compare \nFarooq v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 20-2950, 2023 WL 1813597 \n(3d Cir. Feb. 8, 2023) (concluding Section 1252(b)(i)'s \nfiling deadline runs from the date of the removal order \neven though withholding-only proceedings continue), \nwith Duenas v. Att\u2019y Gen., No. 22-3024, 2023 WL \n6442601 (3d Cir. Oct. 3, 2023) (holding the deadline \nbegins to run only when withholding-only proceedings \nare complete). \nThis split, too, will not disappear on its own.  The \nquestion is complex and challenging\u2014witness the \nfacts that a Fifth Circuit panel reversed itself, two \nThird Circuit panels reached opposite conclusions, \nand the Fourth Circuit denied rehearing by a vote of \neight to six\u2014and that complexity is impeding the \nemergence of a consensus view.  The Fourth Circuit, \nhaving considered and rejected an en banc rehearing \nin Martinez, is not likely to undertake that process \nany time soon.  Meanwhile, the Seventh Circuit care-\nfully assessed the reasoning of the Second and Fourth \nCircuits, and came to a different view with full aware-\nness of the split.  The Sixth Circuit reviewed the same \ndecisions, Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez, that moti-\nvated the Second and Fourth Circuits, and it reached \na contrary conclusion precisely because Guzman \nChavez aligned with its precedents.  Because courts \n\n26 \n \non both sides of the split have entrenched and con-\ntrary views, the Court\u2019s guidance is needed to bring \nthe circuits into alignment.   \nII.   THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED ARE \nIMPORTANT. \nThe questions presented are also of great practical \nimportance. \nThe Court has repeatedly emphasized the im-\nportance of \u201cbring[ing] some discipline to the use of \nth[e] term jurisdictional\u201d when it comes to procedural \nrules imposed by Congress, and for good reason.  Hen-\nderson, 562 U.S. at 435; Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at \n421.  \u201cHarsh consequences attend the jurisdictional \nbrand.\u201d  Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U.S. ____, 139 \nS. Ct. 1843, 1849, 204 L.Ed.2d 116 (2019) (alteration \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[B]ecause \ncourts are not able to exceed limits on their adjudica-\ntive authority, they cannot grant equitable exceptions \nto jurisdictional rules.\u201d  Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at \n416.  \u201cJurisdictional objections,\u201d by contrast, \u201ccan be \nraised at any time in the litigation,\u201d and \u201ccourts must \nenforce jurisdictional rules sua sponte, even in the \nface of a litigant's forfeiture or waiver.\u201d  Id.   \nRiley\u2019s case is a striking example of such harsh \nconsequences.  The government sought to waive the \nSection 1252(b)(1) deadline and permit the court to \nreach the merits of Riley\u2019s petition.  Gov\u2019t C.A. 28(j) \nLtr. (Aug. 14, 2023), 1-2.  The Fourth Circuit could not \naccept such a waiver because it considers the deadline \na jurisdictional rule.  App., infra, 4a.  This sort of sit-\nuation is why the Court \u201cadopted [its] clear-statement \nprinciple in Arbaugh \u2018to leave the ball in Congress\u2019 \n\n27 \n \ncourt,\u2019 [thereby] ensuring that courts impose harsh ju-\nrisdictional consequences only when Congress unmis-\ntakably has so instructed.\u201d Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. \nat 416-17. \nThe current uncertainty over Section 1252(b)(1) \nrisks \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d to litigants.  Henderson, 562 \nU.S. at 434.  Litigants need to know whether the gov-\nernment\u2019s waiver is effective.  Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at \n514-516; Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Bhd. of Locomotive \nEng\u2019rs, 558 U.S. 67 (2009).  Conversely, litigants who \nwish to waive their own arguments may be prejudiced \nif they are unexpectedly or unnecessarily forbidden \nfrom doing so.  Government agencies may often wish \nto waive statutory requirements for efficiency or pol-\nicy reasons, as occurred in the proceedings below.  See \nSebelius v. Auburn Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., 568 U.S. 145, 154 \n(2013); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 766 (1975).   \nAs for the second question presented\u2014when Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline starts in withhold-\ning-only cases\u2014the \u201cdecision regarding when an order \nof removal becomes final will determine what can be \nreviewed.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 635.  The Second Cir-\ncuit and Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Section \n1252(b)(1) bars judicial review for CAT claims from a \nwide range of individuals.  Perversely, these are gen-\nerally the very people for whom such CAT relief is \nlikely to be most important, because they are ineligi-\nble for other forms of relief from removal.  The irony \nis harsh:  If a person cannot receive relief under do-\nmestic immigration policies, the CAT may be the only \navenue available to save the person from facing tor-\nture or death in the country of origin.  But that ineli-\ngibility channels the person into withholding-only \nproceedings, and thereby, in the Second and Fourth \n\n28 \nCircuits, ensures the person will not be able to present \nthat CAT claim to a court.  This outcome is the oppo-\nsite of Nasrallah\u2019s observation, that \u201cit makes some \nsense that Congress would provide an opportunity for \njudicial review\u201d given that \u201cfactual issues may be crit-\nical to determining whether the noncitizen is likely to \nbe tortured if returned.\u201d  590 U.S. at 586.   \nRiley will be killed if he is forced back to Jamaica, \nand the judicial review process is supposed to be a key \npart of the mechanism ensuring the United States \ndoes not cause that result.  People like the Martinez \nand Bhaktibhai-Patel petitioners return to the United \nStates to escape torture or death in their countries of \norigin, and that chain of events is precisely what \nblocks them from judicial review of their claims to pre-\nvent the torture. \nIf a petition for review of an order denying with-\nholding or deferral of removal pursuant to the CAT \nmust be filed within 30 days of a FARO or reinstate-\nment order, judicial review may be foreclosed for \nmany CAT claims.  This outcome is in tension with the \nobligations of the United States under the CAT, an in-\nternational treaty, and with Congress's evident in-\ntent.  As Judge St. Eve observed in F.J.A.P., \u201cCon-\ngress did not explicitly foreclose judicial review of \nCAT orders,\u201d and the Court in Nasrallah refused to \n\u201cinterpret the statute to do so implicitly.\u201d  94 F.4th at \n631. \u201cIn fact, Nasrallah very clearly grounds its intent\nin \u00a7 1252(a)(4) that CAT orders be subject to judicial\nreview.\u201d  Id.  As things currently stand, noncitizens\ndealing with Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline face uncer-\ntainty as to when they need to file a petition for review\n\n29 \nwith the court of appeals, and their ability to seek ju-\ndicial review of a denial of CAT relief depends on the \nvicissitude of where the government detains them.4  \nResolving when Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline starts is also important to further Congress\u2019s in-\ntention to ensure an efficient and streamlined process \nfor judicial review of CAT orders.  Under the Second \nCircuit and Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of \n1252(b)(1), \u201c[p]reserving review of CAT claims\u201d in \nwithholding-only cases \u201cwould require noncitizens to \nfile premature and incomplete petitions seeking re-\nview of not-yet-complete withholding proceedings in \norder to meet \u00a7 1252(b)(1)'s 30-day filing deadline.\u201d  \nF.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 636.  This outcome contravenes \nthe purpose of Section 1252(b)(9)\u2019s \u201czipper clause,\u201d \nwhich is supposed to \u201cconsolidate[] [the court of ap-\npeals\u2019] review of withholding proceedings with [its] re-\nview of final orders of removal.\u201d  Id. at 635.  Similar \nto other cases decided by the Court, such a \u201cscheme \nrequiring \u2018conscientious defense attorneys\u2019 to file un-\nripe suits \u2018would add to the burden imposed on courts, \napplicants, and the States, with no clear advantage to \nany.\u2019\u201d  McDonough v. Smith, 588 U.S.109, 121 (2019) \n(quoting Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007)).  These premature petitions would have to sit \nwith the courts, unresolved, pending the resolution of \nadministrative proceedings, because Congress in-\nstructed that a court \u201cmay review a final order of re-\nmoval\u201d only if the noncitizen has \u201cexhausted all ad-\nministrative remedies available as of right.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n4 The petition for judicial review must be filed in the circuit \nwhere the IJ\u2019s hearing took place.  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2). \n\n30 \n \n1252(d)(1)\u2014including the BIA\u2019s decision on a claim for \nwithholding or deferral of removal.     \nThe current uncertainty on this issue is likely to \nfurther increase the substantial number of petitions \nfor review filed with the courts of appeals.  In the Sec-\nond and Fourth Circuits, and any circuits that have \nnot yet issued a clear opinion on this issue, CAT ap-\nplicants facing removal under 8 U.S.C. 1228 or in re-\ninstatement proceedings must file petitions for review \nbefore they finish withholding-only proceedings to try \nto preserve judicial review of their as-yet adjudicated \nCAT claims.  Even those in favorable circuits may \nchoose to file unripe petitions for review before the \nresolution of their CAT claims as a precautionary \nmeasure.  Removing this uncertainty by deciding the \nquestions presented will avoid adding yet more bur-\nden to an already overtaxed immigration system. \nIII.  THIS CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE \nTO RESOLVE THE QUESTION. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to address the \nquestions presented.   \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s two rulings regarding juris-\ndiction are the only obstacle preventing Riley from re-\nceiving judicial review of the merits of his CAT claim.  \nIn the proceedings below, the government argued that \nthe \u201c30-day deadline is mandatory but not jurisdic-\ntional,\u201d and requested that the Fourth Circuit treat \n\u201cpetitions for review filed following the completion of \nwithholding-only proceedings a[s] timely and review-\nable.\u201d  Gov't C.A. 28(j) Ltr. (Aug. 14, 2023), 1-2.  Thus, \nif the Court finds that Section 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdic-\ntional rule and can therefore be waived, the govern-\nment has already waived Section 1252(b)(1) as a bar \n\n31 \n \nand requested that the Fourth Circuit reach the mer-\nits of Riley\u2019s petition.   \nRiley\u2019s case is also an ideal vehicle to address the \nsecond question presented\u2014whether a petition for re-\nview filed within 30 days of the completion of with-\nholding-only proceedings is timely under Section \n1252(b)(1).  Riley\u2019s withholding-only proceedings were \ncomplete on May 31, 2022, when the BIA reversed the \nIJ\u2019s prior grant of CAT relief and ordered Riley re-\nmoved from the United States to Jamaica.  App., in-\nfra, 13a-14a.  Riley then filed his petition for review \nwith the Fourth Circuit on June 3, 2022, only 3 days \nafter completion of the withholding-only proceedings.  \nApp., infra, 3a.  His petition to the Fourth Circuit was \ntimely under Section 1252(b)(1) if the Court deter-\nmines that the 30-day deadline began to run upon the \ncompletion of withholding-only proceedings (in line \nwith the majority of courts in the split).   \nThus, resolution of either question presented in \nRiley\u2019s favor would provide him substantial relief. \nAnd if Section 1252(b)(1) had not blocked Riley\u2019s \npetition, he presents a strong case on the merits.  The \nIJ, the primary factfinder, found him credible and de-\ntermined he was entitled to CAT relief.  The Fourth \nCircuit necessarily recognized Riley had shown a sig-\nnificant likelihood of success on the merits, a showing \nthat Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009), re-\nquired for the Fourth Circuit to stay Riley\u2019s removal. \nThe questions presented recur in two primary \ntypes of cases:  when a noncitizen faces a statutory bar \nto cancellation of removal due to a prior conviction, \nand when a noncitizen faces a procedural bar on con-\ntesting removability, because of a prior removal order.  \n\n32 \nThe statutory barriers to contesting overall removal, \nin these two situations, and the initial orders of re-\nmoval, are different, though the resulting withhold-\ning-only adjudication then occur under the same reg-\nulations and process.  Riley\u2019s case is an ideal exemplar \nof the first category, and presents a ripe vehicle for the \nCourt \nto \naddress \nthe \napplication \nof \nSection \n1252(b)(1)'s 30-day deadline for this category. \nIV.\nTHE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION\nWAS INCORRECT.\nThe Fourth Circuit was wrong to hold (i) that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdictional rule, as opposed to a \nmandatory processing rule that can be waived; and (ii) \nthat Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline begins to \nrun before the conclusion of agency withholding-only \nproceedings. \nA. Congress did not clearly state that\nSection 1252(b)(1) is a jurisdic-\ntional rule.\nThe Fourth Circuit based its holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is a jurisdictional rule on Stone, 514 U.S. at \n405, and prior Fourth Circuit precedent relying on \nStone.  App., infra, 4a; Martinez, 86 F.4th at 566-67. \nStone, and the Fourth Circuit cases, did not engage in \nthe more \u201cdisciplined\u201d approach the Court has di-\nrected lower courts to use when assessing whether a \nrule is truly jurisdictional.  Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. \nat 421 (explaining that Stone predated the Court\u2019s \nmore recent jurisprudence that has \u201ctried ... to bring \nsome discipline to the use of the term jurisdictional\u201d) \n(citation omitted).   \n\n33 \nThe Court has repeatedly clarified since Stone, \nand as recently as a few weeks ago, that \u201cmost time \nbars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d and that \u201cthis Court will \n\u2018treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional only \nif Congress clearly states that it is.\u201d Harrow v. Dep\u2019t \nof Def., 601 U.S. ____, 144 S. Ct. 1178 (2024) (citations \nomitted); see also Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 \n(same); United States v. Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410 \n(2015) (same). The Court further stated in Santos-\nZacaria that Stone is no longer dispositive as to \nwhether judicial review provisions, like Section \n1252(b)(1), are jurisdictional rules.  598 U.S. at 421. \nThe Ninth Circuit and Fifth Circuit are the only \ncircuits to have engaged in a disciplined textual anal-\nysis of Section 1252(b)(1) since Santos-Zacaria, and \nboth have held that the Court\u2019s analysis in Santos-\nZacaria of Section 1252\u2019s separate exhaustion provi-\nsion demonstrates that Section 1252(b)(1) is not a ju-\nrisdictional rule.  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at 1056; Ar-\ngueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705.  Santos-Zacaria, \nobserved that, unlike Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s exhaustion \nprovision, Congress spoke in plain jurisdictional \nterms elsewhere in Section 1252.  Id. at 418.  In other \nprovisions of Section 1252, Congress specified that \u201cno \ncourt shall have jurisdiction\u201d to review certain mat-\nters.  Id. at 418-19 & n.5 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (b)(9), (g)).  Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s ex-\nhaustion provision contains no such jurisdictional lan-\nguage, and the contrast confirms that Section \n1252(d)(1) is not a jurisdictional rule.  Id. at 419.   \nSection 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline provision \n\u201csuffers from the same flaw\u201d as Section 1252(d)(1)\u2019s \nexhaustion provision.  Alonso-Juarez, 80 F.4th at \n1047; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705.  Section \n\n34 \n1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is in the same statute as the ex-\nhaustion provision that the Court considered non-ju-\nrisdictional in Santos-Zacaria, and it also lacks \nplainly jurisdictional language.  Id.  Consequently, \nthe reasoning of Santos-Zacaria leads to the same \nconclusion about Section 1252(b)(1), namely that it is \nno more jurisdictional than Section 1252(d)(1).   \nEven the Fourth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \nhave acknowledged that \u201cSantos-Zacaria v. Garland \ncalled the jurisdictionality of \u00a7 1252(b)(1) into ques-\ntion.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 626; Martinez, 86 F.4th at \n574 (Floyd, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting \nthat Santos-Zacaria \u201ccast[s] doubt on our characteri-\nzation of the deadline as \u2018jurisdictional\u2019\u201d and \u201cstrongly \nsuggests\u201d the 30-day deadline is a claims-processing \nrule); Allen, 2024 WL 164403, at *2 (\u201c[T]the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in Santos-Zacaria may be at odds \nwith our reasoning in [prior precedent].\u201d).  They treat \nSection 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional not because that is \nthe correct approach, but because they think Stone \nmandates that treatment and \u201cuntil Stone is over-\nturned by the Court itself, we must continue to apply \nit.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 626.   \nThe primary rationale of Stone was a principle \nstated back then, that \u201cstatutory provisions specifying \nthe timing of review \u2026 are, \u2026 \u2018mandatory and juris-\ndictional.\u2019\u201d  514 U.S. at 405.  The Court has repeatedly \nand explicitly rejected that premise.  \u201cCourts will \u2026 \nnot assume that in creating a mundane claims-pro-\ncessing rule, Congress made it \u2018unique in our adver-\nsarial system\u2019 by allowing parties to raise it at any \ntime and requiring courts to consider it sua sponte.\u201d  \nWilkins v. United States, 598 U.S. 152, 158 (2023).  \nAbsent the now-discarded presumption animating \n\n35 \n \nStone, and absent any textual indications that Section \n1252(b)(1) was meant to limit jurisdiction, the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s categorization of the provision cannot stand. \nB. Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day dead-\nline does not start until the comple-\ntion of withholding proceedings. \nThe Fourth Circuit concluded that the FARO is-\nsued to Riley was the only \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d in \nthe case, and because the FARO was the beginning of \nthe process, it necessarily occurred more than 30 days \nbefore the BIA decision for which Riley sought review.  \nApp., infra, 4a-5a.  \nThe statute itself precludes this outcome.  It bars \njudicial review until the noncitizen has exhausted all \navailable \nadministrative \nremedies. \n \n8 \nU.S.C. \n1252(d)(1).  The orders issued in the case cannot be \n\u201cfinal\u201d if there are administrative proceedings still to \nbe completed.  Consistent with that view, the defini-\ntion of \u201corder of deportation\u201d says such an order is not \n\u201cfinal\u201d until the BIA issues its decision (or the time to \nappeal to the BIA has elapsed).  8 U.S.C. 1101(47)(B).   \nThe Fourth Circuit considers its conclusion man-\ndated by Nasrallah and Guzman Chavez.  But neither \ncase interpreted the meaning of \u201cfinality\u201d under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1).  Indeed, the Court explicitly warned \nlower courts that it was not deciding the issue.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 535 n.6; Nasrallah, 590 \nU.S. at 585 (warning courts to not read its decision as \n\u201caffect[ing] the authority of the courts of appeals to re-\nview CAT orders\u201d).  While Guzman Chavez held that \na reinstated order of removal is \u201cadministratively fi-\nnal\u201d for detention purposes under 8 U.S.C. 1231, Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the word \u201cadministratively\u201d in section \n\n36 \n1231 distinguishes it from a \u201cfinal order\u201d for judicial \nreview purposes in Section 1252.  594 U.S. at 534 (\u201cBy \nusing the word \u2018administratively,\u2019 Congress focused \nour attention on the agency\u2019s review proceedings, sep-\narate and apart from any judicial review proceedings \nthat may occur in a court.\u201d). \nThe statutory language, structure, and context of \nSection 1252 all indicate \u201cfinal order\u201d in Section 1252 \nhas a meaning different from \u201cadministratively final\u201d \nfor purposes of detention under Section 1231.  The \u201cor-\ndinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning\u201d of \u201cfi-\nnal\u201d indicates that it is \u201cthe last stage in the process; \nleaving nothing to be looked for or expected.\u201d  F.J.A.P., \n94 F.4th at 634 (citations omitted).    \u201c[A]lthough a \nCAT order does not determine whether a noncitizen \ncan be removed, it does determine where that nonciti-\nzen can be sent,\u201d and \u201c[t]he indeterminacy of where, \nwhile CAT proceedings are pending, suggests that the \nreinstated order might yet leave something \u2018to be \nlooked for or expected,\u2019 subject to possible alteration.\u201d  \nId.  (citations omitted).  The same is true for a FARO, \nwhich, despite the word \u201cfinal\u201d in its title, actually \nmarks the beginning, not the end, of a process to de-\ncide if the removal will be carried out as ordered. \n\u201c[T]he plain meaning of \u2018final\u2019 points us toward the \nconclusion\u201d that an order \u201cdoes not become final for \npurposes of judicial review until the agency has also \nconcluded withholding proceedings.\u201d  Id. \nBoth Judge St. Eve and Judge Murphy have \npointed out that this interpretation also tracks the or-\ndinary understanding of \u201cfinality.\u201d  Black\u2019s Law Dic-\ntionary defines final as \u201clast; conclusive; definitive; \nterminated; completed;\u201d and in reference to legal ac-\ntions, \u201ca judgment is \u2018final\u2019 if no further judicial action \n\n37 \n\u2026 is required.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 634 (quoting \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 6th ed. 1990).  \u201c[P]erhaps we \nshould interpret the word \u2018final\u2019 in the judicial-review \nprovision against the background of the final-judg-\nment rule\u2014which presumes that there will be one ap-\npeal at the end of proceedings rather than many ap-\npeals in \u2018fits and starts\u2019 after each order.\u201d  Kolov, 78 \nF.4th 911 at 928 (J. Murphy, concurring) (citation\nomitted).  \u201cAlthough the noncitizen has been deter-\nmined deportable\u201d in the case of a reinstatement order\nor a FARO, \u201cthe agency\u2019s work is not completed, and\nit may not remove the noncitizen until agency with-\nholding review is complete.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 634\n(citing 8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a) (explaining that a noncitizen\ncannot be removed \u201cbefore a decision is rendered on\nhis or her ... application\u201d)).  Thus, the final decision in\na noncitizen\u2019s withholding-only proceedings reflect\nthat the agency is finished, at which time Section\n1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline begins to run.\nThis reading of the statute also respects the pre-\nsumption that Congress intends judicial review.  \nSmith v. Berryhill, 587 U.S. ____, 139 S. Ct. 1765, \n1776, 204 L.Ed.2d 62 (2019).  This presumption ap-\nplies equally to the reviewability of immigration stat-\nutes.  Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 228-\n231 (2020).  Congress itself also explicitly provided for \njudicial review of CAT orders.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n585-586 (explaining that section 2242(d) of FARRA\ngranted jurisdiction to review CAT claims along with\nremoval orders).  Section 1252(a)(4), enacted as part\nof the 2005 Real ID Act, further confirmed the author-\nity of the courts of appeals to review CAT orders.  Id.\n\u201cIt would be easy enough for Congress to limit judicial\nreview of CAT orders, just as Congress has limited ju-\n\n38 \ndicial review of reinstated orders of removal to a nar-\nrow set of questions.  But Congress has not done so.\u201d  \nF.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 637 (citing Nasrallah, 590 U.S. \nat 583). \nSantos-Zacaria further bolsters this interpreta-\ntion.  While Santos-Zacaria dealt with a different Im-\nmigration and Nationality Act provision, that the \nCourt did not mention Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing dead-\nline when discussing jurisdiction is suggestive.  598 \nU.S. at 414-417.  After the government reinstated \nSantos-Zacaria's removal order, she filed a petition for \nreview in the Fifth Circuit more than 30 days after the \nreinstatement of that order but within 30 days of the \nconclusion of withholding proceedings.  However, \nwhen deciding Santos-Zacaria, the Court never raised \nthe issue of jurisdiction as it must if there is a juris-\ndictional problem.  While not dispositive, Santos-Zac-\naria at a minimum suggests that the majority inter-\npretation of Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day deadline is \ncorrect\u2014\u201c[o]nly when [withholding] proceedings con-\nclude, if the noncitizen is eligible for that review, has \nthe agency finalized all mandatory review and \u2018fully \ndetermined\u2019 the noncitizen\u2019s fate\u201d under Section \n1252(b)(1).  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 637 (citation omit-\nted).   \nThe Court should grant certiorari to make clear \nthat although the portion of an order that discusses \nCAT relief is not in itself an \u201corder of removal,\u201d the \n\u201corder of removal\u201d does not become \u201cfinal\u201d for pur-\nposes of Section 1252(b)(1), thus starting a 30-day \ndeadline for review, until the conclusion of agency pro-\nceedings including the BIA\u2019s decision regarding CAT \nrelief. \n\n39 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEITH BRADLEY \n   Counsel of Record \nKAYLA MARIE MENDEZ \n717 17th Street, Suite 1825 \nDenver, CO 80202 \n(303) 830-1776\nkeith.bradley@squirepb.com\nJEFFREY WALKER \n2000 Huntington Center, \n41 South High Street \nColumbus, OH 43215 \nELIZABETH F.

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL, \nRespondent.\nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals.\nMarch 27, 2024, Submitted; \nApril 26, 2024, Decided\nBefore KING, HARRIS, and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit \nJudges.\nPetition dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this \ncircuit.\n\nAppendix A\n2a\nPER CURIAM:\nPierre Yassue Nashun Riley, a native and citizen of \nJamaica, petitions for review of an order of the Board of \nImmigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) vacating the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order granting Riley\u2019s application for \ndeferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d) and ordering Riley removed to Jamaica. Because \nwe lack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review, we \ndismiss it.\nI.\nRiley entered the United States in 1995 on a tourist \nvisa. In 2006, a federal grand jury returned an indictment \ncharging Riley with conspiracy to distribute and possess \nwith intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of \nmarijuana and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a \ndrug-trafficking crime. A jury found Riley guilty of both \noffenses, and he was sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. \nIn January 2021, Riley was granted compassionate \nrelease.\nJust after Riley\u2019s release from federal prison, the \nimmigration authorities took custody of him. On January \n26, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued \na Final Administrative Removal Order, explaining that \nRiley was removable because he had been convicted of an \naggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). Riley expressed \na fear of returning to Jamaica, and an immigration officer \nconducted a reasonable fear interview. The immigration \nofficer determined that Riley had not established a \n\nAppendix A\n3a\nreasonable fear of persecution or torture in Jamaica, but \nan IJ disagreed and referred Riley to the immigration \ncourt for withholding-only proceedings.\nRiley appeared with counsel before the IJ and \nconceded removability under \u00a7 1228(b). Although Riley \napplied for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, \nand both withholding of removal and deferral of removal \nunder CAT, he later conceded that he was eligible only for \ndeferral of removal under CAT given his prior convictions.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the IJ granted Riley\u2019s \napplication for deferral of removal under CAT. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security appealed the IJ\u2019s \ndecision to the Board, and a three-member panel of \nthe Board issued a May 31, 2022, unpublished decision \nsustaining the appeal. That is, the Board vacated the \nIJ\u2019s order granting relief and ordered Riley removed to \nJamaica.\nOn June 3, 2022, Riley petitioned this court for review \nof the Board\u2019s decision. We later placed this appeal in \nabeyance for the issuance of the mandate in Martinez v. \nGarland, No. 22-1221 (4th Cir.). The mandate in Martinez \nhas issued, and so Riley\u2019s case has been removed from \nabeyance.\n\nAppendix A\n4a\nII.\nA.\n\u201cWe have an independent obligation to assure ourselves \nof jurisdiction to decide an appeal.\u201d Martinez v. Garland, \n86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023). We generally possess \njurisdiction to review \u201ca final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1252(a)(1). A noncitizen must petition for review within \n30 days \u201cof the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(1). \u201cThe 30-day deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional \nand is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d Martinez, 86 F.4th \nat 566 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[O]nce we have \na final order of removal before us, we can consider along \nwith it \u2018all questions of law and fact . . . arising from any \naction taken or proceeding brought to remove [the] alien \nfrom the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)\n(9)) (ellipsis and second alteration in original).\nRiley seeks review of the Board\u2019s order vacating \nthe IJ\u2019s order and denying his application for deferral \nof removal under CAT. We recently held in Martinez, \nhowever, that an order denying CAT relief is not a final \norder of removal for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)(1). Id. at 567. \nSo for us to exercise jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order \ndenying CAT relief, Riley \u201cmust identify another eligible \norder\u201d that is properly before us. Id. But Riley cannot \ndo so because he did not timely petition for review of \na final order of removal. That is, Riley did not petition \nfor review within 30 days of the January 26, 2021, Final \nAdministrative Removal Order. So there is no final order \nof removal properly in front of us that would allow us to \n\nAppendix A\n5a\nreview the Board\u2019s order denying CAT relief. We thus \nlack jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s petition for review. Id. at 571.\nB.\nRiley offers several arguments in favor of our \nexercise of jurisdiction, but none convinces us. To start, \nRiley contends that Martinez should not control in this \ncase because it involves a Final Administrative Order of \nRemoval issued under \u00a7 1228(b), not a reinstated removal \norder, which Martinez addressed. But Riley offers no \npersuasive justification for differentiating between those \ntwo types of orders when applying the jurisdictional \nprinciples delineated in Martinez, and we discern no \nreason to do so.\nRiley next argues that the Final Administrative Order \nof Removal was not actually final for purposes of \u00a7 1252(a)\n(1) because he applied for asylum. Riley was statutorily \nineligible for asylum, however, and he effectively withdrew \nhis asylum application during his merits hearing. See 8 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i). Because Riley could not \nhave obtained asylum relief, his asylum application did \nnot impact his removability. The Final Administrative \nOrder of Removal was thus in fact final despite Riley\u2019s \nasylum application.\nFinally, Riley maintains that we may exercise \njurisdiction over the Board\u2019s order affirming the denial \nof CAT relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4) (\u201c[A] petition \nfor review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in \naccordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive \n\nAppendix A\n6a\nmeans for judicial review of any cause or claim under \n[CAT.]\u201d). But that provision means only that we may \nreview an order denying CAT relief as part of our review \nof a final order of removal. It does not authorize us to \nreview an order denying CAT relief without a final order \nof removal properly before us. See Nasrallah v. Barr, \n140 S. Ct. 1683, 1691, 207 L. Ed. 2d 111 (2020) (citing \u00a7 \n1252(a)(4) and explaining that order denying CAT relief \nis reviewable \u201cas part of the review of a final order of \nremoval\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Martinez, \n86 F.4th at 567 (recognizing that federal appellate court \nmay review order denying CAT relief only as part of its \nreview of final order of removal); Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180, 190 n.13 (2d Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat \u00a7 1252(a)(4) does not enable federal appellate court to \nexercise jurisdiction over order denying CAT relief \u201cin the \nabsence of a judicially reviewable final order of removal\u201d).\nIII.\nBecause we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the petition \nfor review. We dispense with oral argument because the \nfacts and legal contentions are adequately presented in \nthe materials before this court and argument would not \naid the decisional process.\nPETITION DISMISSED\n\nAppendix B\n7a\nAPPENDIX B \u2014 OPINION OF THE UNITED \nSTATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS, \nFILED MAY 31, 2022\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nBOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\nMATTER OF:\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY, A097-534-840\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nOn Appeal from a Decision of the Immigration Court, \nArlington, VA\nBefore: Baird, Appellate Immigration Judge; Gorman, \nAppellate Immigration Judge; Wilson, Appellate \nImmigration Judge\nOpinion by Appellate Immigration Judge Wilson\nWILSON, Appellate Immigration Judge\nThe Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) has \nappealed from an Immigration Judge\u2019s July 27, 2021, \ndecision granting the applicant\u2019s request for protection \nunder the regulations implementing the Convention \n\nAppendix B\n8a\nAgainst Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).1 The applicant, a native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, has filed responses in opposition to \nDHS\u2019 appeal.

Treaty \nDoc. No. 100-20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85 (entered into force for United \nStates Nov. 20, 1994). The applicant\u2019s attorney stated that he is \nonly applying for deferral of removal under the CAT (Tr. at 33). The \nImmigration Judge found the applicant is not eligible for asylum, \nwithholding of removal under the INA or withholding of removal \nunder the CAT because he has been convicted of a particularly \nserious crime (IJ at 6). This finding has not been contested on appeal.\n\nAppendix B\n9a\nnot that \n will harm the applicant upon his return \nto Jamaica (IJ at 9-10). In addition, the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant credibly testified that \n \nhas influence with the neighborhood and the police, that \nthe applicant would be forced to register with the police \nand keep them informed of his movements, which would \nallow \n to know his whereabouts and that he will \nmore likely than not be tortured with the acquiescence of \nthe government (IJ at 10).\nDHS challenges the Immigration Judge\u2019s positive \ncredibility determination (IJ at 4-6). Based on the \ndeferential clear error standard of review, we discern \nno clear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination and will treat the applicant\u2019s testimony as \ncredible for purposes of this appeal.\nHowever, as explained more fully below, we discern \nclear error in the Immigration Judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding what is likely to happen to the applicant upon \nhis removal to Jamaica, and we agree with DHS that the \napplicant has not met his burden of proof to show eligibility \nfor deferral of removal under the CAT. The applicant \nbears the burden to show that it is more likely than not \nthat he would be tortured in Jamaica by, or with the \nconsent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful \nblindness) of, a public official or an individual acting in \nan official capacity. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The \napplicant must make two distinct showings: (i) likely \nfuture mistreatment, i.e., that it is more likely than not he \nwill endure severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted; and (ii) that the likely future mistreatment will \n\nAppendix B\n10a\noccur at the hands of the government or with the consent \nor acquiescence of the government. Cruz-Quintanilla v. \nWhitaker, 914 F.3d 884, 886 (4th Cir. 2019). Importantly, an \napplicant cannot establish eligibility by stringing together \na series of suppositions to show that it is more likely than \nnot that torture will result where the evidence does not \nestablish that each step in the hypothetical chain of events \nis more likely than not to happen. Matter of J-F-F-, 23 \nI&N Dec. 912, 917-18 (A.G. 2006). An Immigration Judge\u2019s \nfindings regarding the likelihood of future harm and of \nacquiescence by the government (i.e., what is likely to \nhappen) are factual findings that the Board reviews for \nclear error. Whether that predicted future harm meets \nthe definition of torture and whether future governmental \nconduct meets the definition of consent or acquiescence \nare questions of law we review de novo. Turkson v. Holder, \n667 F.3d 523, 530 (4th Cir. 2012).\nDHS argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge \nerred in finding that the applicant showed he will more \nlikely than not be tortured and should have found that \nhe presented a speculative chain of events that would \nhappen to him. We agree. While the Immigration Judge \nfound that the applicant has shown a particularized risk \nof torture, this finding is based on speculative assertions \nby the respondent regarding \nThe applicant, who has been in the United States \nfor many years, claims that \n killed two of his \ncousins in Jamaica. But other than his testimony, which \nis not based on first-hand knowledge, there is no objective \ncorroborating evidence that \n killed his relatives \n\nAppendix B\n11a\nor why. Indeed, the grand jury indictment in California \nagainst \n states he was arrested on February 12, \n2010, on his way to pick up marijuana, and thus, he would \nhave been incarcerated in the United States at the time \nof the cousin\u2019s murder in 2011 (Exh. 6D). When asked \nhow he knows \n killed his cousins, he stated that \n and his gang members \u201cbrag about this stuff\u201d \n(Tr. at 51-52). Yet, the affidavits from the applicant\u2019s \nfamily make no mention of \n (Exh. 6). Nor do \nthe affidavits from the applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and \nstepfather mention \n when describing threats \nto kill the applicant they received in 2021 (Exh. 6B). The \nmother\u2019s affidavit states she received phone calls \u201cfrom \nindividuals who live in Jamaica threatening to kill [the \napplicant] on site should he come home\u201d and that neighbors \nreported to her that three masked men asked about the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts (Exh. 6B; Tr. at 68-69). The \napplicant\u2019s sister states in her affidavit that \u201cpeople\u201d have \nasked about him and unknown guys told her the applicant \nhas a green light on him but did not tell her why (Exh. 6B; \nTr. at 68-69). When the applicant was asked why \n \nhas any interest in harming him now and sees him as a \nthreat, the applicant testified \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the big question\u201d \nand that he will expect the applicant to retaliate against \n for his cousins\u2019 deaths because that is the \n\u201cJamaican lifestyle\u201d (Tr. at 47-48). Thus, the applicant\u2019s \nclaims that \n killed or ordered the killing of his \ncousins and is behind the threats his mother and sister \nreceived in 2021 are speculative.\nThe Immigration Judge also found that country \nconditions evidence supports the applicant\u2019s claim \n\nAppendix B\n12a\nbut cited generalized statements in the 2020 State \nDepartment Report regarding government human \nrights abuses, fatalities involving government security \nforces, allegations of torture of people in police custody, \nand insufficient action in addressing abuse and unlawful \nkillings by security forces (IJ at 8-9; Exh. 4C). The \nImmigration Judge did not explain and did not cite to \nany particular evidence of record corroborating the claim \nthat \n is an ex-police officer, that he controls the \napplicant\u2019s old neighborhood, that he killed the applicant\u2019s \nrelatives, or that he poses a particularized risk of harm to \nthe applicant that would amount to torture. The country \nconditions evidence does not mention \n and does \nnot indicate the police will acquiesce in torture. In fact, the \nevidence the applicant cites in his brief on appeal is either \ninformation about crime and safety for foreign travelers to \nJamaica or evidence indicating that crime is a significant \nproblem, but the evidence also indicates that Jamaica \nhas an independent police oversight body and that efforts \nare made to address gangs, corruption, and impunity for \npolice killings (Exh. 6 at pages 142-52, 158-64). Moreover, \nthe mother\u2019s affidavit does not demonstrate a likelihood \nof acquiescence simply because the police stated it would \nnot investigate threats from unknown persons against the \napplicant who currently is not in Jamaica (Exh. 6B). The \nmere existence of a pattern of human rights violations \nin a particular country does not constitute a sufficient \nground for finding that a person would more likely than \nnot be tortured. Nolasco v. Garland, 7 F.4th 180, 191 (4th \nCir. 2021).\n\nAppendix B\n13a\nThus, we conclude that the respondent\u2019s claim is \nbased on the stringing together of a series of suppositions \nand is not supported by sufficient objective evidence to \ncorroborate his speculative fear of torture by \n or \nthat the government will acquiesce in his torture. Matter \nof O-R-E-, 28 I&N Dec. 330, 350 (BIA 2021); Matter of \nJ-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917-18.2\nFor these reasons, we will reverse the Immigration \nJudge\u2019s determination that the applicant has demonstrated \nthat it is more likely than not that he would be subjected \nto torture inflicted by, or at the instigation of or with the \nconsent, acquiescence, or willful blindness of a Jamaican \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nfor purposes of deferral of removal under the CAT.\n2.\u2002  The applicant also alleges in his reply brief that the \nImmigration Judge did not consider, in the aggregate, the likelihood \nof torture because of his status as a criminal deportee and his long-\ntime residence in the United States (Respondent\u2019s Reply Br. at 22-\n24). However, the Immigration Judge found that the applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly (IJ at 7). The applicant \nstates he will be required to register with the government and wear \nan ankle monitor and cites evidence stating that criminal deportees \nare stigmatized (Exh. 6 at 263-303, 310-25). However, he has not \ncited specific evidence that police or other government officials \nsubject criminal deportees to extreme mistreatment, intentionally \ninflict torture on them, or that he personally faces a risk of torture \nby the government or with the consent or acquiescence of a public \nofficial. The evidence he cites does not mention torture of criminal \ndeportees, but rather discusses the difficulty criminal deportees \nhave reintegrating into society and the blame they experience by \nsociety and the government for rising crime rates (Exh. 6). Thus, \nwe find this claim to be without merit.\n\nAppendix B\n14a\nAccordingly, the following orders will be entered.\nORDER: The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \nappeal is sustained.\nFURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge\u2019s order \ndated July 27, 2021, granting deferral of removal under \nthe CAT is vacated, and the applicant is ordered removed \nfrom the United States to Jamaica.\n\nAppendix C\n15a\nAPPENDIX C \u2014 DECISION AND ORDER OF THE \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW, UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION \nCOURT, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA, \nDATED JULY 27, 2021\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nUNITED STATES IMMIGRATION COURT\nARLINGTON, VIRGINIA\nFile: A097-534-840\nIn the Matter of\nPIERRE YASSUE NASHUN RILEY\nApplicant\nIN WITHHOLDING ONLY PROCEEDINGS\nJuly 27, 2021\nCHARGES:\nAPPLICATIONS: \t For m I- 5 89, application for \nwithholding of removal under INA \nSection 241(b)(3), and under the \nConvention against Torture.\n\nAppendix C\n16a\nORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nApplicant is a native and citizen of Jamaica. He \nlast entered the United States on a visitor visa in 1995; \noverstayed. While in the United States he was arrested \ntwice. First in 1998 for marijuana possession as a minor, \nyouthful offender, and then in 2006 he was convicted for \ndistribution of marijuana and possession of a firearm in \nfurtherance of that distribution and then was sentenced to \n25 years\u2019 incarceration. Fast forward to 2021, the District \nCourt Judge signed an order authorizing compassionate \nrelease, and thereafter he was placed in ICE custody \nand was ordered removed pursuant to INA Section \n238(b). And then he claimed a reasonable fear which an \nImmigration Judge found to be reasonable and placed in \nthese proceedings.\nSUMMARY OF RELEVANT TESTIMONY\nApplicant was born on March 22, 1979, native and \ncitizen of Jamaica, lived in Kingston. He did use an alias, \nAdrian Francis for ID and to get into certain bars and \nclubs, what have you. He last entered the United States \nunder his real name on February 3, 1995 and never left. \nHe testified to having distributed marijuana in the past, \nacknowledged that he was convicted and sentenced to 25 \nyears. Ultimately he was released. He said if he returned \nto Jamaica he would be tortured and killed by a man \nnamed \n\nAppendix C\n17a\nThis person, \n he is from the \nneighborhood of Central Kingston, Jamaica, same \nneighborhood as the applicant. In fact, applicant said he \nknew \n His family knew him growing up. \nApplicant said that \n took over the neighborhood \nsometime in the 2000\u2019s. He was an ex-cop, supporter of the \nJLP Party, and after he took over the neighborhood he and \nhis supporters in the neighborhood would harm people and \nproperty. Applicant testified that at one point \n \neven came to the United States but he still had contacts \nin his old neighborhood in Jamaica, including authorities. \nApplicant testified that \n was deported back to \nJamaica from the United States sometime in 2016 or \n2017. He knows because the applicant\u2019s mother and sister \nstill live in Jamaica. They have seen \n Applicant \ntestified also that \n has an issue with his family. \nHe had killed two of the applicant\u2019s cousins, a person \nnamed O\u2019Neal, as well as a person named Darrel, and \nthen threatened all male relatives which includes the \napplicant, that he would kill them or threaten to kill them \nif they return or if he sees them in Jamaica. And this is \nbecause, according to the applicant, \n feels that \nthe relatives of the two people that he murdered would \nexact revenge for the murders against \n Now, \n wants to harm the applicant because he thinks \napplicant is going to seek revenge against him.\nRegarding these two cousins who died, one was \nO\u2019Neal, he died in 2008. He was actually somewhat \nassociated with \n He used to give money to him to \npay off groups, individuals and politics. But when O\u2019Neal \nwanted to quit doing this \n killed him because he \n\nAppendix C\n18a\ntook that as a sign of disrespect. Applicant said that the \npolice did nothing to investigate or solve O\u2019Neal\u2019s murder. \nAnd in fact, when his other cousin, Darrel Scott, tried to \nget the police to investigate further, \n ordered him \nkilled, according to word on the street. That was sometime \nin March 2011. The police, according to applicant, did not \ninvestigate Darrel\u2019s death.\nThe applicant, after serving 15 years in prison, \nwas released for his marijuana distribution conviction, \nfollowing a sentence reduction. Thereafter, his mother \nstarted receiving calls threatening to harm the applicant \nif he ever returned to Jamaica. Applicant said there was \neven a car with masked men who approached applicant\u2019s \nmother looking for the applicant in Jamaica. Applicant \ntestified that his mother then went to file a police report \nbut the police told applicant\u2019s mother that the applicant \nwas not even in Jamaica as among the reasons why they \nrefused to take the report. They also knew that the report \nwas against \n Applicant said that his \nmother was even approached at work by \n himself \nand threatened that he will kill the applicant. At this \npoint the applicant told his mother to stop reporting to \nthe police for fear of being killed. He said his sister also \nreceived communication from \n in Jamaica. They \nthreatened to harm the applicant. He said that the people \nwho approached his sister said they have the green light to \nmurder the applicant from \n Applicant \nalso testified as two other individuals who live in the same \nneighborhood as he did in Jamaica both died following \ndeportation back. He said he cannot relocate anywhere \nin Jamaica because Jamaican authorities force him to \n\nAppendix C\n19a\nregister upon his return, they would know where he is. \nThat would tie directly into \n and allow \n \nto easily become aware of where the applicant is located. \nThat and the entire country of Jamaica is about the size \nof New Jersey. It is fairly small.\nCross-examination he said at the interview that he \ngrew up in a neighborhood controlled by the JLP. But \nexplained that was just a point of fact, not like a choice that \nhe was making. He also clarified that he could be killed \nas a member or for being a supporter of the JLP because \nthat is just the way people are killed in Jamaica. There is \na lot of violence; a lot of it is political. And he indicated he \ndid not mean to claim that he was a member of the JLP \nor the family was a member of the JLP.\nLAW FINDINGS, ANALYSIS, CREDIBILITY, \nCORROBORATION\nWhen testimony is offered in support of an application \nfor relief the Court must consider whether such testimony \nis credible. INA Section 240(c)(4)(B). For applications filed \nafter May 11, 2005 provisions of the REAL ID Act govern \nthe credibility analysis. Making this determination the \nCourt considers the totality of the circumstances and \nall relevant factors. See id. Section 240(c)(4)(C). Matter \nof J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 2007). Generally, \nto be credible, testimony shall satisfactorily explain any \nmaterial discrepancies or omissions, INA Section 240(c)\n(4)(C). The Court may base a credibility determination \non the witness\u2019s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness, the \ninherent plausibility of his account. INA Section 240(c)\n\nAppendix C\n20a\n(4)(C). Other factors include the consistency between \nwritten and oral statements without regard to whether \ninconsistency goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. \nId.; Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. at 263-66.\nIn this case the Court listened carefully to the \napplicant\u2019s testimony. I observed the applicant very \ncarefully as he was answering questions, reviewed the \ndetailed affidavit and the Form I-589 as well as the \nbackground Country Reports from the Department of \nState and other background country evidence in this \ncase. Based on this Court\u2019s thorough review it will find \nthe applicant to be generally credible. The Court notes \napplicant did provide a very detailed application, Form \nI-589, affidavit. Lays out his history growing up. His \ncommission of the crime, his fear of return, who he fears \nreturn from. Harm that his family experienced as the \nbasis for his own fear. And testified in a manner that was \noverall consistent with his prior statements. The Court \nnotes that the evidence also independently corroborates \nthe identity of this individual named \n \nhis involvement with drugs, convictions here in the \nUnited States. There is a letter from family members \nthat also identify \n as being influential \nin the neighborhood having been the source of various \nthreats. There is also corroboration of the two cousins \nwho were killed, and clearly the death reports or the death \ncertificates are not going to indicate or point the finger at \nwho committed the offense. The applicant has himself filled \nin that gap at portion of the testimony to what the Court \nfinds to be credible just based on the information provided \nby the applicant, the manner in which he testified. And \n\nAppendix C\n21a\nthe Court\u2019s opinion that he was forthright and honest. He \nclarified some of the statements that he was confronted \nwith by the Government on cross-examination, namely, \nthat pertaining to questions of his involvement with the \nJLP Party or the opposition party to the JLP, initially it \nappeared that applicant was critical of the JLP Party with \nno indication that he was a member. The Government did \npoint to some questions and answers in the reasonable \nfear interview that would seem to indicate that he was \neither a member or supporter of the JLP Party. The \napplicant clarified that the way the question was asked \nand the way he answered that it was much more narrow \npoint that he was trying to make. That is that he grew up \nin a neighborhood that was controlled by the JLP Party. \nAgain, the applicant indicated that he presented this just \nas a matter of fact and not some choice that his family \nmade to join the JLP versus another party. He followed \nthat up with an explanation of his answers as to whether \nhe could be killed for being a member of the JLP Party. \nHis answer was in the affirmative, but he clarified that \nnot him as a member of the JLP Party but that this is \nwhat happens in Jamaica. Politics is violent. One could \nbe killed for simply being a member of the JLP Party or \nany other party. The Court accepts these explanations. \nThe Court notes that applicant had been in prison for 15 \nyears and is only questioned about his fear of return. It \nappears that the answers could be construed in several \ndifferent ways. The Court gives the applicant the benefit \nof the doubt and I would accept his explanations for why \nhe answers the questions in the manner he did. And with \nthat clarified the Court would find the applicant has put \nforth a credible claim.\n\nAppendix C\n22a\nDEFERRAL OF REMOVAL UNDER THE \nCONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE\nInitially, the Court notes that the applicant is not \neligible for asylum under INA Section 208 or withholding \nunder Section 241(b)(3) or withholding under the \nConvention against Torture for having been convicted of a \nparticularly serious crime, that pertaining to distribution \nof marijuana and then having been sentenced to 25 \nyears, reduced to 15. That leaves him eligible to apply for \nprotection from removal under the Convention against \nTorture or deferral of removal under the Convention \nagainst Torture. \nTo be extended protection under the Convention \nagainst Torture the applicant must establish that it is more \nlikely than not that he would be tortured if removed to his \nhome country. See 8 C.F.R. Section 208.16(c), and see also \nMatter of M-B-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 474, 477-78 (BIA 2002). \nTorture is defined in part as the intentional infliction of \nsevere physical or mental pain or suffering by or at the \ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a \npublic official or other person acting in an official capacity \nin the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. Section 1208.18(a)(1). \nTo meet his burden for CAT protection the applicant must \nmeet two distinct showings. First, he must demonstrate \nlikely future mistreatment in his home country that \nconstitutes severe pain or suffering that is intentionally \ninflicted. See Cruz-Quintanilla v. Whittaker, 914 F.3d 884, \n886 (4th Cir. 2019). And second, the applicant must show \nthe mistreatment will occur at the hands of government \nor with their consent or acquiescence. See id.\n\nAppendix C\n23a\nIn this case, the applicant testified that he fears \n and his associates. Applicant never \nmentioned that he fears the police directly. His only \ncomment about the police is that they will not do anything \nand that they did not do anything when his mother and \nhis cousin, two of whom are dead, but one of them went \nto the police and ended up dying. In neither of those \nincidents the police ever did anything. So the applicant \nmust demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the \npolice, the authorities in Jamaica would acquiesce to his \ntorture at the hands of \n or \n \nassociates. To prove this, applicant must do more than \nshow that the government is powerless to stop the \ntorture. He has to show that the public official would have \nawareness of or will remain willfully blind to the activity \nconstituting torture prior to its commission, and therefore \nbreach their responsibility to intervene to prevent such \nactivity. 8 C.F.R. Section 1208.18(a)(7); see also Suarez-\nValenzuela v. Holder, 714 F.3d 241, 245-46 (4th Cir. 2013). \nRelevant factors to assessing willful blindness include \nbut is not limited to, evidence of past torture, evidence \nof gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights, \ngeneral country conditions, and whether the applicant \ncould relocate to another part of the country where he or \nshe is unlikely to be tortured. See Suarez-Valenzuela v. \nHolder, 714 F.3d at 245.\nApplicant here has credibly testified, as previously \nmentioned, the existence of this individual named Andrew \n his Jamaican nationality, his involvement with \ndrugs, and credibility he testified as to his control over \nthe neighborhood in which applicant lived in which his \n\nAppendix C\n24a\nmother and sister continue to live. Applicant also credibly \ntestified as to \n biography. He is an \nex-cop. He is tied politically to the JLP Party which \ndominates his neighborhood in Jamaica. Applicant also \ncredibly testified as to the harm that \n caused \nhis two cousins, having killed one and then having killed \nthe other for trying to get police to investigate the killing \nof the first cousin. Applicant also credibly testified that \nthe police, when informed of threats of \n against \nhim, did not do anything, refused to do anything. And the \nCourt found all of the above credible, not just based on the \ndetailed testimony, but based on the background evidence \nin this case. The one that is very reliable is the U.S. \nDepartment of State Human Rights Report of Jamaica, \nthe most recent one coming from 2020. Right off the bat \non page one it states significant human rights include \nnumerous reports of unlawful and arbitrary killings by \ngovernment security forces, harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons and detention facilities, arbitrary \narrests and detentions, serious corruption by officials, \nlack of accountability for violence against vulnerable \npopulations. It also states the government took steps to \ninvestigate, prosecute officials, but there were credible \nreports that some officials alleged to have committed \nhuman rights abuses were not subject to full and swift \naccountability. The report goes on to discuss the number \nof people who have been killed, or examples of people who \nhave been killed by the government security forces. The \nincrease in the number of fatalities involving security \nforces in 2020 compared to 2019. Specific to torture, the \nDepartment of State states that there is no definition of \ntorture in Jamaica. That there were allegations of torture \n\nAppendix C\n25a\nespecially for people in police custody. Some examples of \nthese torture that resulting in death, injury, rape. States \nthat the government did not take sufficient action to \naddress abuse and unlawful killings by security forces. \nSays the government has mechanisms to investigate and \npunish the abuse, but they were not always employed. \nIn fact, it states fewer than ten percent of investigations \nof abuse resulted in recommendations for disciplinary \naction or criminal charges, and fewer than two percent \nled to a conviction. All of this is not inconsistent with the \napplicant\u2019s description of how police reacted to his cousin\u2019s \nattempt to find or to have police investigate the murder \nof the applicant\u2019s first cousin, O\u2019Neal, or the applicant\u2019s \ntestimony as to how his mother tried to get the police \ntake the report but they refused to do so. Based on the \napplicant\u2019s credible testimony which is consistent with the \nbackground information in this case, and the Court is not \neven going to go into, although it can, the various other \nbackground articles that were submitted in support of the \napplicant\u2019s case, which details gang violence, prevalence \nor the influence of gangs, the growing influence of gangs \nin Jamaica. There is also a detailed article on the growing \ninfluence of gangs and gang violence in Jamaica from \nAmnesty International. That is all under Exhibit 6, tabs F \nand G. And for these reason the Court finds the applicant \nhas done enough to demonstrate he faces a particularized \nrisk of torture. That being that he is a male member of his \nfamily who have all been threatened by \n who has \nkilled two male members of his family with the police not \ninvestigating the death of the cousins. Applicant has also \ncredibility testified as to the influence that this individual, \n has in the neighborhood and on police. That is \n\nAppendix C\n26a\nimportant for a variety of reasons, one of which is also \nthat applicant would be forced to register his return to \nJamaica and keep police informed of his movements which \nas counsel pointed out would allow \n to know the \napplicant\u2019s whereabouts. So based on the history of this \ncase and \n treatment of applicant\u2019s family the \nCourt find that the threats are real and it is more likely \nthan not that \n would harm the applicant if he \nreturns to Jamaica. Again, a small country with the \npolice knowing where the applicant is, and does not find \nit reasonable for the applicant to relocate and be safe. \nAnd therefore would find that the applicant is more likely \nthan not to be tortured through the acquiescence of and \ntherefore will grant applicant protection from removal \nunder the Convention against Torture.\nCONCLUSION AND ORDERS\nFor the reasons stated, the court enters the following \norders.\nIT IS ORDERED that the applicant be ordered \nremoved from the United States to Jamaica.\nFURTHER ORDERED that the applicant\u2019s \napplication for withholding of removal under Section \n241(b)(3) be denied.\nFURTHER ORDERED that the applicant\u2019s application \nfor withholding of removal under the Convention against \nTorture be denied.\n\nAppendix C\n27a\nFURTHER ORDERED that applicant\u2019s application \nfor deferral of removal under the Convention against \nTorture be granted.\nJuly 27, 2021\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nCHOI, RAPHAEL\nImmigration Judge\n\nAppendix C\n28a\nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION \nREVIEW\nARLINGTON IMMIGRATION COURT\nRespondent Name:\nRILEY, PIERRE YASSUE NASHUN\nTo:\nGeorgiev-Remmel, Dimitar Plamenov\n1220 N.

          "task_beliefs": "I have moved from a state of no knowledge to having a foundational understanding of the legal issues in *Riley v. Bondi*. My initial analysis has identified the two central legal questions presented to the Supreme Court:\n\n1.  **Jurisdictional vs. Claims-Processing Rule:** The first question concerns the nature of the 30-day filing deadline found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The Court must decide if this deadline is \"jurisdictional,\" meaning a failure to meet it permanently divests a court of the power to hear the case, or if it is a \"mandatory claims-processing rule,\" which is still a strict deadline but can be subject to waiver or forfeiture. The Supreme Court has shown a recent trend of classifying filing deadlines as non-jurisdictional claims-processing rules unless Congress has clearly stated otherwise.\n\n2.  **Reviewability of \"Withholding-Only\" Decisions:** The second, more complex question is whether a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in what is termed a \"withholding-only\" proceeding. These proceedings occur after a final order of removal has already been issued and deal solely with applications for protection from removal, such as under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The petitioner, Riley, filed his appeal within 30 days of the BIA's denial of his CAT claim.\n\nMy understanding of the case's procedural history is that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Riley's petition for lack of jurisdiction. It did so by relying on its own binding precedent, *Martinez v. Garland*, which held that a BIA order in a withholding-only proceeding is not a \"final order of removal\" under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and is therefore not directly reviewable by a court of appeals. This establishes the legal basis for the lower court's decision and frames the central conflict the petitioner must overcome. My next step is to investigate the petitioner's arguments, specifically looking for claims of a circuit split on this second question, which would be a strong signal for why the Supreme Court would agree to hear the case.",

          "task_beliefs": "My foundational understanding of the case's legal questions and procedural posture is now significantly enhanced by the petitioner's arguments in the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. My previous belief that a circuit split was a key factor has been confirmed and detailed.\n\nMy beliefs have been updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Confirmation and Detailing of Circuit Splits:** I have moved from anticipating a circuit split to having direct evidence of two distinct and entrenched splits, which the petitioner argues independently warrant the Court's review.\n    *   **Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** The petition confirms a split on whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1)'s 30-day deadline is jurisdictional. The Fourth Circuit, relying on the pre-1996 precedent of *Stone v. INS*, holds that it is. The petitioner argues this conflicts with the modern trend established by the Supreme Court in cases like *Santos-Zacaria v. Garland* and *Wilkins v. United States*, which treat such deadlines as non-jurisdictional claims-processing rules unless Congress provides a \"clear statement.\" The petition notes that the Fifth and Ninth Circuits have recently questioned the jurisdictional nature of the rule in light of these newer Supreme Court cases (*Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland* and *Alonso-Juarez v. Garland*, respectively), creating a clear conflict with the Fourth Circuit's rigid stance.\n    *   **Question 2 (Reviewability of Withholding-Only Decisions):** The petition details a deep 5-2 circuit split on this question. The Fourth Circuit (in *Martinez v. Garland*) and the Second Circuit (in *Bhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland*) form the minority, holding that a BIA decision in a withholding-only proceeding is *not* a \"final order of removal\" that can be appealed. This position is directly contradicted by the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, which all permit review in such circumstances. This deep, acknowledged split is a powerful signal that the Supreme Court will likely intervene to ensure uniformity in federal immigration law.\n\n2.  **Strengthened Understanding of Petitioner's Arguments:** I now have a clear view of the petitioner's core legal arguments, which strengthens my ability to predict the outcome.\n    *   The petitioner argues the Fourth Circuit's rule on withholding-only proceedings creates an impossible \"catch-22.\" A noncitizen must exhaust administrative remedies by waiting for the BIA to rule on their CAT claim, but by doing so, they miss the 30-day deadline calculated from the *initial* removal order, thereby losing their right to judicial review. This effectively nullifies the judicial review pathway for CAT claims (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4)) for an entire category of individuals, which seems contrary to congressional intent.\n    *   The petitioner's argument is textually grounded, pointing to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B), which states a removal order becomes \"final\" upon the BIA's final determination. This directly challenges the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that the order was final 16 months before the BIA ruled.\n\n3.  **Critical New Signal: The Government's Position:** A crucial new fact revealed in the petition is that the government (the respondent) did not defend the Fourth Circuit's jurisdictional ruling below. The petition states, \"The government urged the Fourth Circuit to hear the merits of the case\" and agreed with Riley that the 30-day deadline should be treated as a non-jurisdictional, waivable claims-processing rule. This is a significant signal. When the government itself disagrees with a lower court's jurisdictional dismissal and seeks a ruling on the merits, it strongly suggests the lower court's decision is an outlier and increases the likelihood that the Supreme Court will grant review and reverse.\n\nBased on this new information, my belief that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari has increased substantially. The combination of two clear circuit splits, the compelling \"catch-22\" argument, and the government's apparent agreement with the petitioner on the key jurisdictional question presents a classic case for Supreme Court intervention. My preliminary assessment of the merits now leans heavily in favor of the petitioner on both questions, given the recent trend in Supreme Court jurisprudence on filing deadlines and the severe procedural trap created by the Fourth Circuit's minority position.",

Acquiring this document will either confirm the petitioner's strong position (if the government's opposition is weak or waived) or fundamentally challenge it (if the opposition is strong), leading to a massive update in my predictive model. The Task EIG is 1.0 because no other action could more directly and completely resolve the acknowledged gaps in my knowledge. The Design EIG is also high (0.8) because this sequence (Petition -> Brief in Opposition) represents a foundational and highly effective strategy in SCOTUS prediction.

App. 1a\u20136a) is \nunpublished but available at 2024 WL 1826979.  The \ndecisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Pet. \nApp. 7a\u201314a) and the immigration judge (Pet. App. \n15a\u201327a) are unreported. \n\n2 \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court granted a timely certiorari petition \non November 4, 2024, and has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent provisions are reproduced in the appen-\ndix.  App. 1a\u201339a. \nSTATEMENT \nIndividuals who are not lawful permanent resi-\ndents and have been convicted of aggravated felonies \nare subject to summary administrative-removal pro-\ncesses.  See 8 U.S.C. 1228(b); 8 C.F.R. 1238.1.  They \nare generally barred from seeking relief from removal; \nbut may seek withholding or deferral, particularly un-\nder Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d or \u201cConvention\u201d).   \nThe Convention and U.S. domestic law prohibit the \nUnited States from deporting a noncitizen to a coun-\ntry where he is likely to face government-sponsored \ntorture (hereinafter simply \u201ctorture\u201d).  This prohibi-\ntion applies in all removal proceedings, including Sec-\ntion 1228(b) administrative-removal processes.  A per-\nson\u2019s reasonable fear of torture in the country desig-\nnated for deportation triggers a proceeding before an \nimmigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) to determine the person\u2019s en-\ntitlement to withholding or deferral of removal (here-\ninafter referred to solely as \u201cwithholding\u201d for brevity).  \nEither side\u2014government or noncitizen\u2014can then ap-\npeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d).  8 \nC.F.R. 1208.31(e), (g)(2)(ii).  The Board\u2019s decision de-\ntermines whether the noncitizen will be deported to \nthe country where the noncitizen fears torture.  The \n\n3 \nstakes are enormous, indeed life-or-death.  An errone-\nous denial of withholding, if uncorrected, leads the \nUnited States to contribute to an individual\u2019s persecu-\ntion or torture (sometimes his murder) by forcibly \nsending him to that fate.   \nThe questions in this case determine when\u2014and \nultimately whether\u2014a noncitizen in that situation \ncan obtain judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision.  The \nFourth Circuit holds its jurisdiction is predicated on \nthe filing of a petition for review within 30 days of an \nadministrative document issued by a Department of \nHomeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) immigration officer at the \noutset, not the Board\u2019s subsequent decision adjudicat-\ning withholding of removal.  The latter happens more \nthan 30 days after the immigration officer\u2019s decision\u2014\nin this case 15 months later\u2014so the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nholding effectively curtails judicial review of withhold-\ning claims after Section 1228(b) proceedings. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion is wrong on two \nfronts.  First, the 30-day deadline is not jurisdictional.  \nIt is a simple claims-processing rule, like myriad oth-\ners that the Court has clarified are not jurisdictional \nlimits.  Second, the 30-day clock starts upon issuance \nof a \u201cfinal\u201d removal order, and an agency order be-\ncomes \u201cfinal\u201d at the completion of administrative pro-\nceedings.  That occurred only when the Board issued \nits decision.  Nothing in the Immigration and Nation-\nality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) signals a different meaning for the \nfinality of removal orders.  The lower court misappre-\nhended Nasrallah, which held a denial of CAT relief \nis not itself an order of removal.  Nasrallah does not \nalter the ordinary meaning of finality for the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking regarding the order of removal.    \n\n4 \nWithholding of removal, for those who qualify, is \nmandatory.  No matter what misdeeds may cloud a \nperson\u2019s past, the United States maintains a solemn \ncommitment not to send the person to face torture or \ndeath at the hands of a lawless regime in another \ncountry.  Congress has repeatedly reaffirmed that \ncommitment by authorizing judicial review of CAT \nclaims as a backstop to prevent legal error.  Section \n1252 should not be interpreted, contrary to that com-\nmitment, to strip review from those whose claims to \nwithholding of removal are the most pressing. \nI. Legal Background \nA. Removal Proceedings \nNoncitizens previously convicted of aggravated fel-\nonies1 are \u201cpresumed to be deportable.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1228(c).  The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) may de-\ntermine a person\u2019s deportability through a hearing be-\nfore an IJ.  8 U.S.C. 1229a(a).  Or, if the person is not \na lawful permanent resident, an immigration officer \ncan determine his deportability, based on the aggra-\nvated-felony conviction, through an administrative or-\nder without an IJ.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(1)\u2013(2).   \nIn the second path\u2014Section 1228(b) administra-\ntive-removal proceedings\u2014the immigration officer is-\nsues a \u201cNotice of Intent.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 238.1(b).  The \nnoncitizen has 10 days to file a response.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(c)(1).  DHS can then, upon making the requisite \ndeterminations, issue a document titled a \u201cFinal Ad-\nministrative Removal Order\u201d (\u201cFARO\u201d).  8 C.F.R. \n1 \u201cAggravated felonies\u201d include, among others, peti-\ntioner\u2019s conviction under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43); 18 U.S.C. 924(c),  \n\n5 \n238.1(d).  The determinations at this stage can be \ncomplex, and the statute contemplates judicial review \nat the appropriate time.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(3), (4)(E).   \nThe FARO must \u201cdesignate the country of re-\nmoval.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(f)(2).  If the noncitizen ex-\npresses fear of returning to that country, an asylum \nofficer conducts \u201ca reasonable fear determination.\u201d  8 \nC.F.R. 1238.1(f)(3).   \nIf the noncitizen \u201chas a reasonable fear of persecu-\ntion or torture,\u201d2 an IJ adjudicates, under 8 C.F.R. \npart 1208 subpart A, the claim to withholding or de-\nferral of removal.  8 C.F.R. 1208.31(e).  During that \nprocess, the noncitizen cannot be deported.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.5(c).  Withholding refers to both a statutory bar \non deporting a noncitizen to a country where the per-\nson\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened . . . because \nof the [noncitizen\u2019s] race, religion,\u201d or other specified \ncauses, 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(A); and to the comparable \nprotection under CAT Article 3.  Deferral is CAT pro-\ntection for those individuals whose circumstances ren-\nder them ineligible for withholding.  See infra 47\u201349.  \n(As noted above, supra 2, for brevity this brief gener-\nally uses the term \u201cwithholding\u201d to refer to both forms \nof protection.)

Af-\nter the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a deci-\nsion reversing an immigration judge\u2019s grant of protec-\ntion, petitioner promptly sought review by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Although \nboth parties urged the court to decide the merits of the \ncase, the court of appeals dismissed the petition for \nlack of jurisdiction, citing 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), which \nstates \u201c[t]he petition for review must be filed not later \nthan 30 days after the date of the final order of re-\nmoval.\u201d  \nThe questions presented are: \n(1) Whether \nthe \n30-day \ndeadline \nin \n8 \nU.S.C. 1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review of an \norder of removal is jurisdictional. \n(2) Whether a noncitizen satisfies the deadline in \nSection 1252(b)(1) by filing a petition for review chal-\nlenging an agency order denying withholding of re-\nmoval or protection under the Convention Against \nTorture within 30 days of the issuance of that order.  \n\nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestions Presented ..................................................  \nTable of Authorities ................................................... iv \nOpinions Below ........................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ................................................................. 2 \nStatutory Provisions Involved ................................... 2 \nStatement ................................................................... 2 \nI. \nLegal Background ................................. 4 \nA. \nRemoval Proceedings ................. 4 \nB. \nThe Convention Against \nTorture ........................................ 6 \nC. \nJudicial Review .......................... 7 \nII. \nFactual and Procedural \nBackground ......................................... 10 \nSummary of Argument ............................................. 12 \nArgument .................................................................. 17 \nI. \nSection 1252(b)(1) does not state \na jurisdictional prerequisite. .............. 17 \nA. \nNo unmistakable evidence \nmarks Section 1252(b)(1) \nas jurisdictional ........................ 18 \nB. \nThis Court has not \ndefinitively interpreted \nSection 1252(b)(1) as \njurisdictional ............................ 21 \nII. \nPetitioner satisfied Section \n1252(b)(1) by filing in court \nwithin 30 days of the Board\u2019s \ndecision. ............................................... 28 \ni\n\niii \nA. \nUnder the ordinary \nmeaning of \u201cfinal,\u201d the \norder of removal does not \nreach that point until all \nagency proceedings \nconclude  ................................... 29 \nB. \nThe context confirms the \nordinary usage of \u201cfinal\u201d in \nSection 1252(b)(1) ..................... 34 \nC. \nNothing in Section 1252 \noverrides the presumption \nof judicial review ...................... 40 \nD. \nNasrallah does not require \nthe Court to reject the \nordinary meaning of \n\u201cfinal.\u201d ....................................... 45 \nE. \nGuzman Chavez did not \ndecide when an order of \nremoval is \u201cfinal\u201d for \npurposes of judicial review....... 49 \nF. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation of finality \nupends the orderly process \nof judicial review ...................... 51 \nConclusion ............................................................... 53 \nAppendix \nStatutory and Regulatory Provisions ............... 1a \n\n(iv) \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \n \nPage(s) \nCases \nAbramski v.

App. 1a\u20136a) is \nunpublished but available at 2024 WL 1826979.  The \ndecisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Pet. \nApp. 7a\u201314a) and the immigration judge (Pet. App. \n15a\u201327a) are unreported. \n\n2 \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 26, \n2024.  This Court granted a timely certiorari petition \non November 4, 2024, and has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent provisions are reproduced in the appen-\ndix.  App. 1a\u201339a. \nSTATEMENT \nIndividuals who are not lawful permanent resi-\ndents and have been convicted of aggravated felonies \nare subject to summary administrative-removal pro-\ncesses.  See 8 U.S.C. 1228(b); 8 C.F.R. 1238.1.  They \nare generally barred from seeking relief from removal; \nbut may seek withholding or deferral, particularly un-\nder Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \n(\u201cCAT\u201d or \u201cConvention\u201d).   \nThe Convention and U.S. domestic law prohibit the \nUnited States from deporting a noncitizen to a coun-\ntry where he is likely to face government-sponsored \ntorture (hereinafter simply \u201ctorture\u201d).  This prohibi-\ntion applies in all removal proceedings, including Sec-\ntion 1228(b) administrative-removal processes.  A per-\nson\u2019s reasonable fear of torture in the country desig-\nnated for deportation triggers a proceeding before an \nimmigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) to determine the person\u2019s en-\ntitlement to withholding or deferral of removal (here-\ninafter referred to solely as \u201cwithholding\u201d for brevity).  \nEither side\u2014government or noncitizen\u2014can then ap-\npeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d).  8 \nC.F.R. 1208.31(e), (g)(2)(ii).  The Board\u2019s decision de-\ntermines whether the noncitizen will be deported to \nthe country where the noncitizen fears torture.  The \n\n3 \nstakes are enormous, indeed life-or-death.  An errone-\nous denial of withholding, if uncorrected, leads the \nUnited States to contribute to an individual\u2019s persecu-\ntion or torture (sometimes his murder) by forcibly \nsending him to that fate.   \nThe questions in this case determine when\u2014and \nultimately whether\u2014a noncitizen in that situation \ncan obtain judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision.  The \nFourth Circuit holds its jurisdiction is predicated on \nthe filing of a petition for review within 30 days of an \nadministrative document issued by a Department of \nHomeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) immigration officer at the \noutset, not the Board\u2019s subsequent decision adjudicat-\ning withholding of removal.  The latter happens more \nthan 30 days after the immigration officer\u2019s decision\u2014\nin this case 15 months later\u2014so the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nholding effectively curtails judicial review of withhold-\ning claims after Section 1228(b) proceedings. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s conclusion is wrong on two \nfronts.  First, the 30-day deadline is not jurisdictional.  \nIt is a simple claims-processing rule, like myriad oth-\ners that the Court has clarified are not jurisdictional \nlimits.  Second, the 30-day clock starts upon issuance \nof a \u201cfinal\u201d removal order, and an agency order be-\ncomes \u201cfinal\u201d at the completion of administrative pro-\nceedings.  That occurred only when the Board issued \nits decision.  Nothing in the Immigration and Nation-\nality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) signals a different meaning for the \nfinality of removal orders.  The lower court misappre-\nhended Nasrallah, which held a denial of CAT relief \nis not itself an order of removal.  Nasrallah does not \nalter the ordinary meaning of finality for the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking regarding the order of removal.    \n\n4 \nWithholding of removal, for those who qualify, is \nmandatory.  No matter what misdeeds may cloud a \nperson\u2019s past, the United States maintains a solemn \ncommitment not to send the person to face torture or \ndeath at the hands of a lawless regime in another \ncountry.  Congress has repeatedly reaffirmed that \ncommitment by authorizing judicial review of CAT \nclaims as a backstop to prevent legal error.  Section \n1252 should not be interpreted, contrary to that com-\nmitment, to strip review from those whose claims to \nwithholding of removal are the most pressing. \nI. Legal Background \nA. Removal Proceedings \nNoncitizens previously convicted of aggravated fel-\nonies1 are \u201cpresumed to be deportable.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1228(c).  The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) may de-\ntermine a person\u2019s deportability through a hearing be-\nfore an IJ.  8 U.S.C. 1229a(a).  Or, if the person is not \na lawful permanent resident, an immigration officer \ncan determine his deportability, based on the aggra-\nvated-felony conviction, through an administrative or-\nder without an IJ.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(1)\u2013(2).   \nIn the second path\u2014Section 1228(b) administra-\ntive-removal proceedings\u2014the immigration officer is-\nsues a \u201cNotice of Intent.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 238.1(b).  The \nnoncitizen has 10 days to file a response.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(c)(1).  DHS can then, upon making the requisite \ndeterminations, issue a document titled a \u201cFinal Ad-\nministrative Removal Order\u201d (\u201cFARO\u201d).  8 C.F.R. \n1 \u201cAggravated felonies\u201d include, among others, peti-\ntioner\u2019s conviction under the Controlled Substances \nAct.  8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43); 18 U.S.C. 924(c),  \n\n5 \n238.1(d).  The determinations at this stage can be \ncomplex, and the statute contemplates judicial review \nat the appropriate time.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(3), (4)(E).   \nThe FARO must \u201cdesignate the country of re-\nmoval.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 1238.1(f)(2).  If the noncitizen ex-\npresses fear of returning to that country, an asylum \nofficer conducts \u201ca reasonable fear determination.\u201d  8 \nC.F.R. 1238.1(f)(3).   \nIf the noncitizen \u201chas a reasonable fear of persecu-\ntion or torture,\u201d2 an IJ adjudicates, under 8 C.F.R. \npart 1208 subpart A, the claim to withholding or de-\nferral of removal.  8 C.F.R. 1208.31(e).  During that \nprocess, the noncitizen cannot be deported.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.5(c).  Withholding refers to both a statutory bar \non deporting a noncitizen to a country where the per-\nson\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened . . . because \nof the [noncitizen\u2019s] race, religion,\u201d or other specified \ncauses, 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(A); and to the comparable \nprotection under CAT Article 3.  Deferral is CAT pro-\ntection for those individuals whose circumstances ren-\nder them ineligible for withholding.  See infra 47\u201349.  \n(As noted above, supra 2, for brevity this brief gener-\nally uses the term \u201cwithholding\u201d to refer to both forms \nof protection.)  The noncitizen is not allowed to contest \nremovability before the IJ.  8 C.F.R. 1208.2(c)(3)(i).  \nBut the procedures are the same as for ordinary re-\nmoval proceedings.  8 C.F.R. 1208.2(c)(3) (incorporat-\n2 If the asylum officer determines the noncitizen lacks \nreasonable fear, the person can request IJ review on \nthat point.  8 C.F.R. 1208.31(e), (g).  If the IJ\u2019s decision \nis also negative, that decision is susceptible to judicial \nreview. \n\n6 \ning \u201cthe same rules of procedure as proceedings con-\nducted under 8 C.F.R. part 1240, subpart A\u201d).  An IJ\u2019s \norder granting withholding must include an order \nthat the noncitizen be removed to a specific country, \nfor which removal is withheld.  Matter of I-S & C-S-, \n24 I. & N. Dec. 432, 434 (BIA 2008). \nThe noncitizen or DHS can appeal the IJ\u2019s decision \nto the Board.  8 C.F.R. 1208.31(e).  A removal order \ncannot be executed while the appeal is pending.  8 \nC.F.R. 1003.6(a).  \nB. The Convention Against Torture \nUnder CAT Article 3, \u201c[n]o State Party shall expel, \nreturn (\u2018refouler\u2019) or extradite a person to another \nState where there are substantial grounds for believ-\ning that he would be in danger of being subjected to \ntorture.\u201d  Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-\nment, Art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u2013\n20, 1465 U.N.T.S. 113.  Article 3 is absolute.  Even \n\u201cpersons who pose a danger to the security of the \nUnited States\u201d are protected.  64 Fed. Reg. 8,478, \n8,479 (Feb. 19, 1999).  That protection, where it ap-\nplies, is mandatory.  8 C.F.R. 1208.16(d), 1208.17(a) \n(if eligibility is proved, relief \u201cshall be granted\u201d).  \nMoncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 187, n.1 (2013) \n(government \u201chas no discretion to deny relief to a \nnoncitizen who establishes his eligibility\u201d).   \nThe Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \n(\u201cFARRA\u201d) called for regulations to implement CAT \nArticle 3.  Pub. L. 105-277, \u00a7 2242(b), 112 Stat. 2681-\n822.  DOJ\u2019s 1999 rule incorporated CAT claims into \nthe framework described above.  64 Fed. Reg. at 8,479.  \n\n7 \nTo address an instruction in FARRA, \u00a7 2242(c), to ex-\nclude certain categories of noncitizens from protection \nto the extent permitted by CAT Article 3, DOJ estab-\nlished two tiers of relief.  A noncitizen who is not dis-\nqualified by a circumstance such as a prior felony sen-\ntence would receive \u201cwithholding\u201d of removal.3  A \nnoncitizen who is disqualified would, instead, receive \n\u201cdeferral.\u201d  Id. at 8,480.  (As noted above, p.2 supra, \nthis brief generally uses the term \u201cwithholding\u201d to en-\ncompass both forms of protection.)  Both outcomes \nblock DHS from removing the noncitizen to the coun-\ntry where he would likely be tortured.  Id.  They differ \nin various administrative details, such as \u201cthe mode \nof termination\u201d of the protection if circumstances \nchange.  Id. at 8,481\u20138,482.   \nC. Judicial Review \nIn 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Im-\nmigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. 104-\n208, \u00a7\u00a7 301\u2013388, 110 Stat. 3009-575, \u201crepealed the old \njudicial-review scheme . . . and instituted a new (and \nsignificantly more restrictive) one.\u201d  Reno v. Ameri-\ncan-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, \n475 (1999).  One restriction was a \u201czipper\u201d clause, un-\nder which \u201c[j]udicial review of all questions of law and \nfact, . . . arising from any . . . proceeding brought to \n3 Besides CAT article 3, 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3) also pre-\nscribes withholding to prevent persecution.  The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s conclusions about the 30-day dead-\nline apply for this protection too.  A noncitizen who \nreceived a sentence over five years for an aggravated \nfelony can only receive deferral, not CAT withholding \nor statutory withholding.  Id.   \n\n8 \nremove [a noncitizen] . . . shall be available only in ju-\ndicial review of a final order under this section.\u201d  8 \nU.S.C. 1252(b)(9).  A further limitation tightened ju-\ndicial review standards for factual determinations.  8 \nU.S.C. 1252(b)(4).  IIRIRA also barred judicial review \nof \u201cany final order of removal against [a noncitizen] \nwho is removable\u201d because of a prior aggravated fel-\nony conviction.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(C). \nIn 2001, this Court held the new restrictions did \nnot preclude writs of habeas corpus, preserving that \nmechanism for contesting removal orders.  INS v. St. \nCyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001).  Subsequently, given the en-\ntitlement of some noncitizens to CAT protection under \nFARRA and its implementing regulations, lower \ncourts entertained claims in habeas challenging deni-\nals of CAT protection.  E.g., Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, 329 \nF.3d 191, 202 (1st Cir. 2003); Ogbudimkpa v. Ashcroft, \n342 F.3d 207, 222 (3d Cir. 2003).   \nIn 2005, the REAL ID Act, Pub. L. 109-13, \u00a7 106, \n119 Stat. 310, amended Section 1252 to bar habeas \ncases yet ensure that circuit-court review would be an \n\u201cadequate substitute.\u201d  Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, \n589 U.S. 221, 232\u2013233 (2020); see also Nasrallah v. \nBarr, 590 U.S. 573, 580 (2020).  To that end, Section \n1252 now allows \u201creview of constitutional claims or \nquestions of law raised upon a petition for review . . . \nin accordance with this section,\u201d even for those with \ncriminal convictions.  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(D).  In addi-\ntion, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law \n(statutory or nonstatutory), . . . a petition for review \n. . . in accordance with this section shall be the sole \nand exclusive means for judicial review of any cause \nor claim under [CAT].\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4).  \n\n9 \nCircuit courts generally understood new Section \n1252(a)(4) allowed judicial review of CAT claims even \nafter administrative-removal processes.  See, e.g., \nJean-Pierre v. U.S. Attorney General, 500 F.3d 1315, \n1316\u20131317 (11th Cir. 2007); Owino v. Holder, 575 F.3d \n956, 958 (9th Cir. 2009).  Courts also recognized that \nthe 30-day filing deadline, from Section 1252(b)(1), \nstarts at the true conclusion of administrative pro-\nceedings: the Board\u2019s decision (where Board appeal is \navailable).  E.g., Eke v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 372, 377\u2013\n378 (7th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[T]he immigration authorities \nwere not finished with Eke\u2019s case until the [Board\u2019s] \nfinal decision.\u201d).   \nNasrallah held a Board denial of CAT withholding \nis not in itself an \u201corder of removal,\u201d so that the juris-\ndictional bars at Section 1252(a)(2)(B)\u2013(C) do not pre-\nclude judicial review of factual issues regarding CAT \nprotection.  590 U.S. 573.  Nasrallah noted that Sec-\ntion 1252(a)(4), added by the REAL ID Act, \u201cprovides \nfor direct review of CAT orders in the courts of ap-\npeals,\u201d and consequently \u201cour decision does not affect \nthe authority of the courts of appeals to review CAT \norders.\u201d  Id. at 585.   \nThe topic here is whether that review can be ob-\ntained by a petition filed (like petitioner\u2019s) within 30 \ndays of the Board\u2019s decision about withholding.  The \nlower court concluded that because denying CAT pro-\ntection is not itself an order of removal, the final order \nof removal must have been the FARO issued over a \nyear before the Board\u2019s decision, before the adjudica-\ntion of withholding even began.  The Fourth Circuit \nalso deems that 30-day deadline a jurisdictional re-\nquirement.  The questions of when the 30-day clock \n\n10 \nstarts, and whether it is a jurisdictional limitation, de-\ntermine whether the Fourth Circuit can hear peti-\ntioner\u2019s case. \nII. Factual and Procedural Background \nPetitioner was born in Jamaica.  His father, a U.S. \ncitizen, brought petitioner here in 1995 as a minor on \na tourist visa.  App. 12a.  Since then, petitioner has \nlived continuously in New York City, believing he was \na U.S. citizen.4  He has seven children here, all U.S. \ncitizens. \nIn 2006, petitioner was convicted of drug distribu-\ntion and firearm possession and sentenced to 25 years\u2019 \nimprisonment.  App. 1a.  In January 2021, the district \ncourt granted compassionate release, finding he had \nreceived sufficient punishment.  App. 3a\u20135a.  \nDHS served petitioner a Notice of Intent on Janu-\nary 27, 2021, and issued a FARO the following day.  \nApp. 52a\u201355a, 7a\u20138a.  The FARO stated that peti-\ntioner would be deported to Jamaica.  App. 8a.  Peti-\ntioner immediately asserted he feared persecution \nand torture there.  App. 55a.  An IJ found petitioner \nhad reasonable fear and undertook to determine his \neligibility for CAT protection.  App. 9a\u201310a, 59a.  \nAt the ensuing hearing, petitioner testified that a \ndrug kingpin with ties to the Jamaican government \nordered the murder of several of petitioner\u2019s relatives, \nincluding having one of petitioner\u2019s cousins killed for \nasking police to investigate another relative\u2019s murder.  \nApp. 23a\u201327a.   \n4 While this brief uses the term \u201cnoncitizen,\u201d peti-\ntioner does not waive any potential claim he may have \nto citizenship. \n\n11 \nThe kingpin has vowed to kill every male member \nof petitioner\u2019s family for at least a decade, and has \nspecifically threatened to kill petitioner if he returns \nto Jamaica.  App. 21a\u201323a, 66a\u201367a.  The situation \nhas escalated as news of petitioner\u2019s release from \nprison spread.  App. 21a.  The kingpin and his gang \nhave told petitioner\u2019s family members both here and \nin Jamaica\u2014in no uncertain terms and on multiple \noccasions\u2014that the kingpin will kill petitioner as soon \nas he arrives in Jamaica.  App. 21a, 30a\u201335a.  Jamai-\ncan police said they could not and would not intervene \nto prevent petitioner\u2019s murder.  App. 31a\u201332a. \nPetitioner explained the kingpin\u2019s association with \nthe Jamaican government. App. 15a\u201318a. 35a.  Peti-\ntioner also presented documentary evidence, includ-\ning affidavits from relatives; corroboration for the nar-\nrative about the kingpin; and \u201ccountry conditions\u201d ev-\nidence about Jamaica\u2019s government.  See App. 18a.  \nHe further explained that upon return to Jamaica, he \nwill be unable to hide from the kingpin, because the \nJamaican government requires the registration and \ntracking of deportees like petitioner.  App. 37a. \nThe IJ found petitioner credible, and determined \nhis murder, with the acquiescence of Jamaican au-\nthorities associated with the kingpin, is more likely \nthan not if petitioner returns to Jamaica.  Pet. App. \n20a\u201321a.  The IJ therefore granted his application for \nCAT protection.  Pet. App. 27a.  \nDHS appealed that decision.  App. 91a.  The Board \nthen (improperly) reweighed the evidence and con-\ncluded that to show his murder would be more likely \nthan not, petitioner first had to reach that same \nthreshold of proof for each of the kingpin\u2019s murders of \npetitioners\u2019 relatives.  Pet. App. 8a\u201313a.  The Board \n\n12 \nthen reversed the IJ\u2019s grant of protection.  The result-\ning order stated:  \u201c[T]he applicant is ordered removed \nfrom the United States to Jamaica.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  A \nnotice accompanying the Board\u2019s order informed peti-\ntioner that any petition for review . . . must be filed \n. . . within 30 days of the date of the [attached] deci-\nsion.\u201d  App. 44a.  \nPetitioner promptly petitioned for judicial review, \nApp. 42a.  He requested a stay of removal pending the \nappeal, explaining he would be killed if he returned to \nJamaica.  Pet. C.A. Mot. for Stay 17.  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit granted that request.  No. 22-1609 (4th Cir. July \n5, 2022).  The parties fully briefed the merits, but \nwhile the case was pending the Fourth Circuit decided \nin Martinez v. Garland, 86 F.4th 561 (4th Cir. 2023), \nthat a Board decision resolving only a disputed with-\nholding claim is not a final removal order, and the 30-\nday clock starts at some earlier point.  The Fourth Cir-\ncuit then dismissed petitioner\u2019s case for lack of juris-\ndiction, over the objections of both petitioner and the \ngovernment.  Pet. App. 6a.  The court withheld its \nmandate pending this Court\u2019s disposition of the case, \nso petitioner\u2019s removal to Jamaica currently remains \nstayed.  No. 22-1609 (4th Cir. June 5, 2024). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nThis case presents two related questions concern-\ning 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), which requires a petition for \njudicial review to be filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe date of the final order of removal.\u201d  The first ques-\ntion concerns whether that deadline is jurisdictional; \nthe second, when the 30-day period starts.   \n\n13 \nA.  Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline is not jurisdic-\ntional.  The Court has clarified the standard for ele-\nvating a statutory requirement to a jurisdictional pre-\nrequisite:  It will \u201ctreat a rule as jurisdictional \u2018only if \nCongress clearly states that it is.\u2019\u201d  Santos-Zacaria v. \nGarland, 598 U.S. 411, 416 (2023).  Absent \u201cunmis-\ntakabl[e]\u201d evidence of such intent, a rule is presumed \nto be nonjurisdictional.  Id. at 417. \nThere is no such evidence for Section 1252(b)(1).  \nAs observed in Santos-Zacaria, some provisions \nwithin Section 1252 clearly address jurisdiction, by \nusing that word.  The lack of such language in subsec-\ntion (d)(1), considered in Santos-Zacaria, and in sub-\nsection (b)(1) here, indicates these provisions are not \nintended to be jurisdictional.  The text of subsection \n(b)(1) is similar to provisions the Court has held non-\njurisdictional; and subsection (b)(1) is placed along-\nside several other nonjurisdictional requirements. \nThe Fourth Circuit erroneously relies on Stone v. \nINS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995).  That case predated the \nCourt\u2019s clarification of what it means for a require-\nment to be \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d  Stone was not truly about \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  Rather, the Court ad-\ndressed whether a motion to reopen tolls the time for \nseeking judicial review of the underlying Board deci-\nsion.  Stone\u2019s passing reference to time limits as juris-\ndictional was just the sort of \u201cdrive-by\u201d that the Court \nhas said will not rank as precedent against its more \nrecent explication of how to identify truly jurisdic-\ntional limitations.  That dictum cannot stand against \nthe mass of decisions reiterating that time limits are \nusually not jurisdictional.   \nB.  Nor should the petition have been rejected as \nuntimely.  The Section 1252(b)(1) deadline runs from \n\n14 \nthe date of a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d  Here, that date \nwas May 31, 2022, when the Board issued its decision \nboth denying Petitioner protection under CAT and \nterminating agency proceedings.  Petitioner timely \nfiled for judicial review just four days later.  The \nFARO issued in January 2021 was not \u201cfinal\u201d for these \npurposes until the Board resolved petitioner\u2019s claim \nfor CAT protection; and the Board\u2019s decision itself also \nconstituted an \u201corder of removal\u201d that was \u201cfinal.\u201d \nThis Court has a well-developed understanding, \nbased on ordinary English usage, of what it means for \nan order to be \u201cfinal.\u201d  An order is not \u201cfinal\u201d until all \npending proceedings before the decisionmaker have \nconcluded.  The language and context of Section \n1252(b)(1) incorporate that ordinary meaning of \u201cfi-\nnal.\u201d  That ordinary meaning was settled for judicial \nreview under the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. 2341\u20132351, \nand under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), \n5 U.S.C. 551\u2013559.  The use of \u201cfinal order\u201d in Section \n1252(b)(1) presumably carries those traditional un-\nderstandings.  Congress reaffirmed its incorporation \nof established meanings by explicitly invoking the \nHobbs Act as the source of procedures in Section 1252.   \nThe context confirms that the Board\u2019s decision, in \npetitioner\u2019s situation, was the moment of the \u201cfinal or-\nder of removal,\u201d because only that interpretation is \nconsistent with Section 1252\u2019s other provisions.  First, \nthe requirement to exhaust all administrative reme-\ndies, 8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1), presupposes that a nonciti-\nzen is able to attempt those remedies before the order \nof removal reaches finality.  Second, the zipper clause, \n8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9), requires consolidation of all ques-\ntions arising from \u201cany . . . proceeding brought to re-\nmove an alien,\u201d into \u201cjudicial review of a final order \n\n15 \nunder this section.\u201d  Apart from one explicit exception \n(involving a motion to reopen a Board decision, inap-\nplicable here), a given removal proceeding must be \npresumed to generate only one occasion for judicial re-\nview.  That Congress also expressly authorized review \nof CAT claims in that context indicates Congress un-\nderstood a removal order becomes final alongside the \nCAT order.   \nContrary to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s suggestion, no \nother statute, and no decision of this Court, suggests \na departure from the settled approach to finality. \nThe Fourth Circuit erroneously relies on 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(47)(B), which identifies two particular cir-\ncumstances making an \u201corder of deportation\u201d final: a \nBoard decision \u201caffirming\u201d such an order or the expi-\nration of the deadline for appealing to the Board.  On \nits face, Section 1101(a)(47)(B) does not actually de-\nfine finality for all purposes.  Indeed, it cannot.  A Sec-\ntion 1228(b) administrative-removal order does not \ngenerate a Board appeal right, so neither situation \nidentified in paragraph (a)(47)(B) ever occurs.  Final-\nity must therefore be governed by the ordinary and \ntraditional meaning of the term \u201cfinal.\u201d \nThe Fourth Circuit also misinterpreted this \nCourt\u2019s recent decisions in Nasrallah and Guzman \nChavez.  Nasrallah did not address when an order of \nremoval becomes \u201cfinal.\u201d  Nor did it hold that an order \nresolving a claim for withholding of removal cannot \nalso include a removal order, or render a removal or-\nder final.  \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez addressed a different \nprovision that uses different language to address a dif-\n\n16 \nferent situation. The Court held a request for with-\nholding does not prevent a removal order from being \n\u201cadministratively final\u201d for purposes of detention un-\nder 8 U.S.C. 1231.  594 U.S. 523, 540 (2021).  The \nCourt acknowledged Section 1252(b)(1)\u2014the provi-\nsion at issue here\u2014uses \u201cdifferent language,\u201d and \u201cex-\npress[ed] no view\u201d about the proper interpretation \nthat provision.  Id. at 535, n.6. \nA FARO cannot be executed as written until the \nagency proceedings have concluded.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.5(a); 8 C.F.R. 1003.6(a).  (A noncitizen can, by \nstatute, be deported to another country besides the \none identified in the FARO, but that cannot happen \nwhile DOJ is adjudicating claims to protection against \nremoval to the designated country.)  It is on hold until \nthat point; so only at the end of that administrative \nprocess does it become \u201cfinal\u201d in the Section 1252(b)(1) \nsense.  The Board order itself, by releasing the hold on \nremoval, constitutes an \u201corder of removal\u201d that is \u201cfi-\nnal.\u201d  And the Board order in petitioner\u2019s case explic-\nitly ordered petitioner removed, Pet. App. 14a, \nthereby constituting an \u201corder of removal\u201d that was, \nof course, \u201cfinal.\u201d  Thus, although the substance of the \nBoard\u2019s decision concerned petitioner\u2019s claim for CAT \nprotection, the issuance of that order also marked a \nfinal order of removal.   \nConcluding otherwise would effectively bar review \nof claims to withholding of removal, because the \nBoard\u2019s order necessarily comes more than 30 days af-\nter the immigration officer\u2019s initial order.  Such a re-\nsult would run contrary to the general presumption of \njudicial review and the explicit grant of judicial review \nfor CAT claims in Section 1252.   \n\n17 \nARGUMENT \nThe petition should not have been dismissed for \nlack of jurisdiction, because the 30-day deadline is not \njurisdictional.  Nor should it have been rejected as un-\ntimely, because the 30 days started upon the Board\u2019s \ndecision.   \nI. Section 1252(b)(1) does not state a jurisdic-\ntional prerequisite. \nThe Court \u201ctreat[s] a rule as jurisdictional \u2018only if \nCongress clearly states that it is.\u2019\u201d  Santos-Zacaria, \n598 U.S. at 416 (citation omitted).  The Court \u201cadopted \nthis clear-statement principle in Arbaugh [v. Y & H \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500 (2006)]\u201d because \u201c[h]arsh conse-\nquences attend the jurisdictional brand,\u201d as the Court \nhas detailed multiple times.  598 U.S. at 416.  Those \nconsequences include a court\u2019s inability to \u201cgrant eq-\nuitable exceptions to jurisdictional rules,\u201d the fact \nthat jurisdictional objections \u201ccan be raised at any \ntime in the litigation,\u201d and the mandate to \u201cenforce ju-\nrisdictional rules sua sponte, even in the face of a liti-\ngant\u2019s forfeiture or waiver.\u201d  Id.  The Arbaugh princi-\nple \u201censure[s] that courts impose such harsh jurisdic-\ntional consequences only when Congress unmistaka-\nbly has so instructed.\u201d  Id. at 416\u2013417. \n\u201cCongress need not \u2018incant magic words,\u2019 . . . but \nthe \u2018traditional tools of statutory construction must \nplainly show that Congress imbued a procedural bar \nwith jurisdictional consequences.\u2019\u201d  Boechler, P.C. v. \nCommissioner of Internal Revenue, 596 U.S. 199, 203 \n(2022).   \n\n18 \nA. No unmistakable evidence marks Section \n1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional. \n\u201cTime and again, [the Court] ha[s] described filing \ndeadlines as \u2018quintessential claim-processing rules,\u2019 \nwhich \u2018seek to promote the orderly progress of litiga-\ntion,\u2019 but do not deprive a court of authority to hear a \ncase.\u201d  United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, \n410 (2015).  \u201c[M]ost time bars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d \nid.\u2014for example the two-year and six-month bars in \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, id.; the 12-year limit in \nthe Quiet Title Act, Wilkins v. United States, 598 U.S. \n152 (2023); the 30-day deadline for seeking Tax Court \nreview of a seizure, Boechler, 596 U.S. 199; the 60-day \ndeadline for review of a Merit Systems Protection \nBoard decision, Harrow v. Department of Defense, 601 \nU.S. 480 (2024); and the 120-day deadline to appeal a \ndenial of veterans\u2019 benefits, Henderson ex rel. Hender-\nson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428 (2011).  \nSection 1252(b)(1) is textually similar to those \nother timing rules.  The structure of Section 1252 sig-\nnals the nonjurisdictional character of subsection \n(b)(1) by separating it from statements about jurisdic-\ntion.  And subsection (b)(1) is located near, and paral-\nlel to, a provision the Court already held is nonjuris-\ndictional. \nFirst, the text \u201clacks plainly jurisdictional lan-\nguage.\u201d  Alonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, \n1047 (9th Cir. 2023).  \u201cThe petition for review must be \nfiled not later than 30 days after the date of the final \norder of removal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1).  That sentence \ndoes not \u201cexpressly refer to subject-matter jurisdiction \nor speak in jurisdictional terms.\u201d  Musacchio v. United \nStates, 577 U.S. 237, 246 (2016).  It does not state any \n\n19 \n\u201cbounds of the \u2018court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u2019\u201d San-\ntos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416.  The words are like those \nconsidered in Henderson, where the provision said a \npetitioner \u201cshall file a notice of appeal . . . within 120 \ndays after the date\u201d of notice of the agency\u2019s decision, \n562 U.S. at 438 (quoting 38 U.S.C. 7266(a)).  The word \n\u201cmust\u201d does not convey a jurisdictional intent; \u201c[not] \n\u2018all mandatory prescriptions, however emphatic, are \n. . . properly typed jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d  Henderson, 562 \nU.S. at 439 (omission in original).  Nothing else about \nSection 1252(b)(1) speaks of jurisdiction any more \nthan the Henderson provision did.  It \u201c\u2018reads like an \nordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations,\u2019 \nspelling out a litigant\u2019s filing obligations without re-\nstricting a court\u2019s authority.\u201d  Wong, 575 U.S. at 411.   \nSecond, paragraph (b)(1) is one of nine \u201crequire-\nments\u201d for \u201creview of an order of removal.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1).  Most of those requirements are obviously \nnot jurisdictional.  For example, paragraph (2) identi-\nfies the proper venue, a matter \u201crelate[d] to the con-\nvenience of litigants\u201d that has a \u201cbasic difference \n[from] the court\u2019s power.\u201d  Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem \nShipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S. 165, 168 (1939).  Para-\ngraph (4) says the court \u201cshall decide the petition only \non the administrative record,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A), \na provision that logically cannot be a jurisdictional \nprerequisite.  Paragraph (3)(C) states a time limit, af-\nter the court\u2019s receipt of the administrative record, for \nthe noncitizen\u2019s opening brief.  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(3)(C).  \nThat deadline cannot be jurisdictional because \u201cthe ju-\nrisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things \nat the time of the action brought.\u201d  Grupo Dataflux v. \nAtlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 570 (2004).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019s separation of a filing deadline from a ju-\nrisdictional grant often indicates that the time bar is \n\n20 \nnot jurisdictional.\u201d  Wong, 575 U.S. at 412.  Position-\ning (b)(1) alongside multiple plainly non-jurisdictional \nprovisions is an even stronger sign. \nTrue, paragraph (b)(9) says:  \u201cExcept as otherwise \nprovided in this section, no court shall have jurisdic-\ntion . . . to review such an order.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9).  \nPlacement in the same subsection cannot support a \n\u201cproximity-related\u201d inference that paragraph (b)(1) is \njurisdictional; \u201c[a] requirement we would otherwise \nclassify as nonjurisdictional . . . does not become juris-\ndictional simply because it is placed in a section of a \nstatute that also contains jurisdictional provisions.\u201d  \nSebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S. \n145, 155 (2013).  Auburn held that jurisdictional sta-\ntus for paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) within 42 U.S.C. \n1395oo would not confer jurisdictional character for a \nneighboring paragraph (a)(3) deadline.  Id.  The sepa-\nration and distinction between paragraphs (b)(1) and \n(9) here are even clearer.  Nor does paragraph (9), by \nlimiting jurisdiction \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in \nthis section,\u201d elevate all requirements in Section 1252 \nto jurisdictional status.  \u201c[A] nonjurisdictional provi-\nsion does not metamorphose into a jurisdictional lim-\nitation by cross-referencing a jurisdictional provi-\nsion,\u201d Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U.S. 541, 551, \nn.8 (2019), nor by being \u201ccross-referenced,\u201d Gonzalez\nv. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 145 (2012).  Harrow rejected \nan argument that by conferring jurisdiction for peti-\ntions filed \u201cpursuant to\u201d a given statutory section, \nCongress converted that section\u2019s procedural require-\nments into jurisdictional prerequisites.  \u201c[W]e . . . \ncould say that Harrow filed his appeal \u2018pursuant to\u2019 \n\u00a7 7703(b)(1) even though he failed to satisfy that sec-\ntion\u2019s time bar.\u201d  601 U.S. at 487.   \n\n21 \nThird, Santos-Zacaria decided that a neighboring \nprocedural requirement in the same statute, subsec-\ntion (d)(1), is nonjurisdictional. 598 U.S. at 416.  Two \nobservations were particularly salient to the Court\u2019s \nanalysis.  The Court noted the (d)(1) requirement\u2014\nexhaustion of administrative remedies\u2014is a \u201cquintes-\nsential claim-processing rule\u201d and \u201croutinely . . . \u2018non-\njurisdictional.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 417.  And the expressly juris-\ndictional language in paragraph (b)(9) affirmatively \nsuggests paragraph (d)(1) is nonjurisdictional:  Para-\ngraph (d)(1)\u2019s \u201clanguage differs substantially from \nmore clearly jurisdictional language in related statu-\ntory provisions.\u201d  Id. at 418.  Both observations are \nequally true for subsection (b)(1).  \u201cNo jurisdictional \nlanguage is present in the [(b)(1)] provision even \nthough Congress clearly provided for jurisdictional \ntreatment elsewhere.\u201d  Inestroza-Tosta v. Attorney \nGeneral, 105 F.4th 499, 511 (3d Cir. 2024).  And filing \ndeadlines are also \u201cquintessential claims-processing \nrules,\u201d Wong, 575 U.S. at 410.  Santos-Zacaria held \nthat \u201cto be confident Congress took th[e] unexpected \ntack\u201d of \u201cattach[ing] jurisdictional consequences to a \nrequirement that usually exists as a claims-pro-\ncessing rule,\u201d \u201cwe would need unmistakable evidence, \non par with express language addressing the court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  598 U.S. at 418.  There is no evidence of \nthat sort for paragraph (b)(1), any more than for (d)(1). \nB. This Court has not definitively inter-\npreted Section 1252(b)(1) as jurisdictional. \nThe Court has \u201cstated it would treat a requirement \nas \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 when \u2018a long line of [Supreme] \nCour[t] decisions left undisturbed by Congress\u2019 at-\ntached a jurisdictional label to the prescription.\u201d  Fort \nBend County, 587 U.S. at 548 (alterations in original).  \n\n22 \nBut such cases are \u201cexceptional.\u201d  Harrow, 601 U.S. at \n488.  \n1. Stone does not dictate the interpreta-\ntion of Section 1252(b)(1). \nThis Court has never addressed whether Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional\u2014Stone considered the pre-\nIIRIRA statute, with substantially different judicial \nreview provisions\u2014so there is no \u201clong line\u201d of such \ndecisions from this Court.  In theory, a decision about \na predecessor provision could provide the requisite \nprecedent.  See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United \nStates, 552 U.S. 130 (2008) (adhering to old precedent \ntreating as jurisdictional the statute of limitations for \ndamages against the government).  But Stone does not \npass muster as a jurisdictional decision under the \nCourt\u2019s post-Arbaugh rubric. \n\u201c[C]ourts, including this Court, have more than oc-\ncasionally misused the term \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 to refer to \nnonjurisdictional prescriptions.\u201d  Wilkins, 598 U.S. at \n159.  \u201cTo separate the wheat from the chaff, this Court \nhas asked if the prior decision addressed whether a \nprovision is \u2018technically jurisdictional\u2019\u2014whether it \ntruly operates as a limit on a court\u2019s subject-matter \njurisdiction\u2014and whether anything in the decision \n\u2018turn[ed] on that characterization.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 160 (alter-\nation in original).  \u201cThe mere existence of a decision \nemploying the term jurisdiction without elaboration \ndoes not show Congress adopted that view.\u201d  Id. at \n165.   \nBy that standard, Stone is not a jurisdictional prec-\nedent about the 30-day deadline.  Stone decided \nwhether a motion for reconsideration rendered an im-\n\n23 \nmigration order non-final, thus tolling the filing dead-\nline triggered by the order.  514 U.S. at 389\u2013390.  In \npassing, the Court said the applicable filing deadline \n(under an earlier version of the INA), which might \nhave been tolled by a reconsideration motion had the \nCourt\u2019s interpretation gone the other way, is \u201cmanda-\ntory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Id. at 405.  This Court has \nspecifically characterized the Stone statement as \n\u201cwithout elaboration,\u201d Henderson, 562 U.S. at 437, ex-\nactly the sort of passing remark that Wilkins said \nwould not count.   \nIn Stone, the government consistently argued that \nthe noncitizen\u2019s petition was untimely against the \noriginal order.  Rejecting the petition was warranted \nwhether on jurisdictional or merely procedural \ngrounds.  The court of appeals denominated its action \nas a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, Stone, 514 U.S. \nat 389; but \u201c[i]f a decision simply states that \u2018the court \nis dismissing for lack of jurisdiction\u2019\u201d it is understood \nas a \u2018drive-by jurisdictional rulin[g]\u2019 that receives \u2018no \nprecedential effect.\u2019\u201d  Wilkins, 598 U.S. at 160 (altera-\ntion in original).   \nNothing in Stone turned on its characterization of \nthe 30-day deadline as jurisdictional.  The Court re-\nlied primarily on an INA provision requiring review of \na motion to reconsider to be consolidated with review \nof the underlying order, thus indicating each order \nneeded its own petition.  514 U.S. at 393\u2013394.  The \nCourt\u2019s mention of the 30-day deadline as jurisdic-\ntional appears in a short penultimate paragraph, not-\ning the Court\u2019s interpretation was supported by the \nprinciple that \u201c[j]udicial review provisions . . . are ju-\nrisdictional in nature and must be construed with \nstrict fidelity to their terms.\u201d  Id. at 405.  Nothing in \n\n24 \nStone suggests the Court would have been less faith-\nful to the statutory text with those provisions deemed \nnon-jurisdictional.  \nStone\u2019s statement that \u201cjudicial review provisions\u201d \nare \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is a sterling example of what Wil-\nkins said would not detract from the Arbaugh clear-\nstatement rule.  Provisions about appeal to a court \nfrom an agency are not presumptively jurisdictional; \nthey are governed by the Arbaugh principle.  Harrow, \n601 U.S. at 489.  While Stone said time limits are \n\u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d 514 U.S. at 405, call-\ning a time limit \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional\u201d is not \nnecessarily a reference to subject-matter jurisdiction.  \nKontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 454\u2013455 (2004) \n(\u201c[C]lassify[ing] time prescriptions, even rigid ones, \nunder the heading \u2018subject matter jurisdiction\u2019 can be \nconfounding.\u201d) (alteration in original).   \nFurthermore, \nSantos-Zacaria \nalready \nfound \nStone\u2019s judicial characterization lacking.  Santos-Zac-\naria construed a judicial review provision that is, as \nnoted, in the same section of the same statute as Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1).  Were the Stone observation about \u201cju-\ndicial review provisions\u201d binding, Santos-Zacaria\ncould not have found Section 1252(d)(1) nonjurisdic-\ntional.  Instead, the Court conducted the same analy-\nsis that Wilkins described.  It rejected Stone because \n(a) Stone did not \u201cattend[] to the distinction between \n\u2018jurisdictional\u2019 rules . . . and nonjurisdictional but \nmandatory ones,\u201d and (b) \u201cwhether the provision[] \nw[as] jurisdictional \u2018was not central to the case.\u2019\u201d  598 \nU.S. at 421.  \n\n25 \n2. Had Stone decided the judicial-review \ndeadline was truly jurisdictional, the \nCourt should overrule that decision. \nEven if the foregoing analysis were incorrect, the \n\u201cprinciples of stare decisis,\u201d Wilkins, 598 U.S. at 159, \nwould call for rejecting the Stone observation.   \nWhen \u201cdeciding whether to overrule a past deci-\nsion,\u201d the Court considers factors that include (1) \u201cthe \nquality of [the precedent\u2019s] reasoning\u201d; (2) \u201cthe work-\nability of the rule it established\u201d; (3) the precedent\u2019s \n\u201cconsistency with other related decisions\u201d; (4) \u201cdevel-\nopments since the decision was handed down\u201d; and (5) \n\u201creliance on the decision.\u201d  Janus v. State, County, and \nMunicipal Employees, 585 U.S. 878, 917 (2018) (alter-\nation in original).  Those factors disfavor Stone\u2019s ob-\nservation about the 30-day deadline.  \na. Stone provided no reasoning about whether the \ndeadline is jurisdictional; it simply recited that time \nlimits are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  The Court \nhas described such statements as \u201cconfounding\u201d and a \n\u201c[mis]use[]\u201d of the terms.  Scarborough v. Principi, 541 \nU.S. 401, 413\u2013414 (2004) (quoting Kontrick, 540 U.S. \nat 454\u2013455) (alteration in original); see also Eberhart\nv. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 16 (2005) (\u201crecent deci-\nsions have attempted to brush away confusion intro-\nduced by our earlier opinions\u201d about which prescrip-\ntions are jurisdictional).   \nb.  The Stone observation is not \u201cworkab[le].\u201d  San-\ntos-Zacaria reiterated that treating a procedural re-\nquirement as limiting judicial authority is problem-\natic because of the \u201charsh consequences.\u201d  598 U.S. at \n416.   \n\n26 \nc.  The Stone observation is inconsistent with other \nrelated decisions.  If Stone governed the Court\u2019s deci-\nsion today, Section 1252(b)(1) would stand nearly \nalone as a time limit with jurisdictional consequences.  \nThe jurisdictional time limits regarding judicial ap-\npeals, Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), are \n\u201cstatutory deadlines to appeal \u2018from one Article III \ncourt to another\u2019\u201d; \u201c[a]s to all other time bars,\u201d includ-\ning appeal \u201cfrom an agency,\u201d \u201cwe now demand a \u2018clear \nstatement.\u2019\u201d  Harrow, 601 U.S. at 489.   \nd.  The government has not relied on the Stone ob-\nservation, but, rather, agrees Section 1252(b)(1) is not \njurisdictional.  Br. in Opp. 7\u20139. \ne.  Developments have fatally undercut Stone\u2019s ju-\nrisdictional observation.  The Court has adopted the \nArbaugh principle since then, and also established \nthat time limits are ordinarily not jurisdictional.  \nMoreover, Congress substantially amended the INA \njust a year after Stone.  Pub. L. 104-208, \u00a7\u00a7 301\u2013388, \n110 Stat. 3009-575.  IIRIRA was no mere recodifica-\ntion; it \u201crepealed the old judicial-review scheme . . . \nand instituted a new (and significantly more restric-\ntive) one.\u201d  American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525 U.S. at 475; see also Calcano-Martinez v. \nINS, 533 U.S. 348, 350 (2001) (describing IIRIRA\u2019s \n\u201cnew provisions governing the judicial review of immi-\ngration orders\u201d).  The statutory context and structure \nare different from what Stone considered.   \n3. Hobbs Act decisions from lower courts \ndo not show Congress meant Section \n1252(b)(1) to be jurisdictional. \nIn Henderson, the government contended the \ndeadline for petitions to the Veterans Court should be \n\n27 \njurisdictional because \u201clower court decisions have uni-\nformly held that the Hobbs Act\u2019s 60-day time limit for \nfiling a petition for review of certain final agency de-\ncisions, 28 U.S.C. 2344, is jurisdictional.\u201d  562 U.S. at \n437.  But this Court has not decided whether the \nHobbs Act time limit is jurisdictional.  For overcoming \nthe Arbaugh principle, \u201clower court opinions\u201d cannot \n\u201cstand in for a ruling of this Court.\u201d  Wilkins, 598 U.S. \nat 165.  Boechler too rejected the argument that lower-\ncourt decisions suffice for the \u201clong line\u201d of precedents \nto displace the Arbaugh presumption.  596 U.S. at \n208.  Moreover, lower-court doctrines about the Hobbs \nAct deadline generally \u201cpredate this Court\u2019s effort to \n\u2018bring some discipline\u2019 to the use of the term \u2018jurisdic-\ntional.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435).  \n\u201c[P]re-Arbaugh lower court cases interpreting a re-\nlated provision are not enough to make clear that a \nrule is jurisdictional.\u201d  Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at \n422.   \nIf this Court considered the Hobbs Act deadline to-\nday, that deadline would likely be non-jurisdictional.  \nIts separation from the pertinent jurisdiction-confer-\nring provision is particularly stark.  One section, enti-\ntled \u201cJurisdiction of court of appeals,\u201d states that a cir-\ncuit court \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction . . . to determine \nthe validity of\u201d certain agency orders.  28 U.S.C. 2342.  \nThe deadline appears in a different section, entitled \n\u201cReview of orders; time; notice; contents of petition; \nservice.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  The heading groups the \ntime limit with other procedural requirements, treat-\ning them all as ordinary claims-processing rules.  That \norganization and the separation from the jurisdic-\ntional provision make it particularly unlikely the \n\n28 \nCourt would conclude, under Arbaugh and its prog-\neny, that the Hobbs Act time limit was clearly in-\ntended to rank as jurisdictional. \nIn sum, Section 1252(b)(1) is plainly not a jurisdic-\ntional limitation in light of the Court\u2019s precedents over \nthe last two decades.  Stone, which made a passing \nobservation about the time limit in the pre-IIRIRA \nstatute, is not a precedent the Court must or should \nrespect on that point. \nII. Petitioner satisfied Section 1252(b)(1) by fil-\ning in court within 30 days of the Board\u2019s \ndecision. \nCongress explicitly authorized judicial review for \nclaims under CAT Article 3 (as implemented in \nFARRA and DOJ regulations).  Section 1252(a)(4) \nsays circuit courts review \u201ccause[s] or claim[s] under \nthe [CAT].\u201d  Nasrallah explained this provision \u201cpro-\nvides for direct review of CAT orders in the courts of \nappeals.\u201d  590 U.S. at 585.  \n\u201cWith respect to review of an order of removal . . . \n[t]he petition for review must be filed not later than \n30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d  8 \nU.S.C. 1252(b)(1).  That sentence does not explicitly \naddress review of CAT orders.  But the zipper clause \nsays \u201c[j]udicial review . . . shall be available only in ju-\ndicial review of a final order under this section.\u201d  8 \nU.S.C. 1252(b)(9).  Lower courts take for granted that \nfor judicial review of a CAT order, the petition must \nbe filed within 30 days of a final order of removal. \nPetitioner\u2019s was, because under the ordinary \nmeaning of \u201cfinal,\u201d his removal order was not final un-\ntil the termination of agency proceedings resolving all \nremaining outstanding issues.  That is the concept of \n\n29 \nfinality in ordinary English, and multiple features of \nSection 1252 confirm that usage in this context.  \u201cIn \nstatutory interpretation disputes, a court\u2019s proper \nstarting point lies in a careful examination of the or-\ndinary meaning and structure of the law itself.\u201d  Food \nMarketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. \n427, 436 (2019).  The relevant words are to be read \n\u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the statutory \ncontext, \u2018structure, history, and purpose.\u2019\u201d  Abramski\nv. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (citation \nomitted).  Further, DOJ\u2019s regulations implementing \nCAT Article 3 are in line with petitioner\u2019s understand-\ning; and treating an earlier order of an official subor-\ndinate in the process as the \u201cfinal order\u201d would con-\ntravene the presumption of judicial review.  The text, \ncontext, structure, and purpose all yield the same an-\nswer:  The Board decision marked the point in time of \na \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d in petitioner\u2019s case, even \nthough the issue directly addressed was about CAT \nprotection. \nA. Under the ordinary meaning of \u201cfinal,\u201d \nthe order of removal does not reach that \npoint until all agency proceedings con-\nclude. \n\u201cFinal\u201d refers to an event \u201cconstituting the end re-\nsult of a succession or process,\u201d the \u201cultimate\u201d out-\ncome.  American Heritage College Dictionary 510 (3d \ned. 1993).  The \u201cfinal\u201d decision \u201ccom[es] at the end: be-\ning the last in a series, process, or progress.\u201d  \nWebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 628 (10th ed. 1993).  \nA \u201cfinal order,\u201d according to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \nis one that \u201cterminates the litigation\u201d [and] \u201cleaves \nnothing to be done.\u201d (6th ed. 1993). \u201c[U]nless other-\nwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their \n\n30 \nordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u2019\u201d Sandifer\nv. United States Steel Corp., 571 U.S. 220, 227 (2014) \n(citation omitted).5\nThe Court has understood finality this way for dec-\nades.  In 1948, the Court explained that a particular \ndecision by the Civil Aeronautics Board was not final \nbecause it was not the \u201cconsummation of the adminis-\ntrative process.\u201d  Chicago & Southern Air Lines v. Wa-\nterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948).  Con-\nversely, in 1970, in holding a different agency\u2019s deci-\nsion was final for purposes of review, the Court said \none of the two \u201crelevant considerations in determining \nfinality [is] whether the process of administrative de-\ncisionmaking has reached a stage where judicial re-\nview will not disrupt the orderly process of adjudica-\ntion.\u201d  Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. \nRederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62, 71 \n(1970).  Lower courts uniformly apply such standards \nunder the Hobbs Act.  \u201c[I]n an adjudication a final or-\nder is one that disposes of all issues as to all parties.\u201d  \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. NRC, 680 \nF.2d 810, 815 (D.C. Cir. 1982).   \nBennett v. Spear applied these concepts for inter-\npreting the word \u201cfinal\u201d in the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d):  \u201c[F]or agency action to be \u2018final\u2019,\u201d \n\u201cthe action must mark the \u2018consummation\u2019 of the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.\u201d  520 U.S. 154, 177\u2013\n5 The statutory definition of \u201corder of deportation\u201d is \nfollowed by a list of two situations in which such an \norder becomes final.  That does not mandate an un-\nderstanding of finality different from the ordinary \nmeaning.  See infra at 38\u201339 (discussing 8 U.S.C. \n1101(a)(47)). \n\n31 \n178 (1997).  See also Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assns., \n531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001) (same for direct circuit-court \nreview of EPA Clean Air Act rules).  Smith v. Berryhill\nheld that given the plain meaning of \u201cfinal,\u201d \u201cthe \nphrase \u2018final decision\u2019 [in the Social Security Act] \nclearly denotes some kind of terminal event.\u201d  587 U.S. \n471, 479 (2019).  \nThe Court\u2019s understanding of what makes a dis-\ntrict-court judgment \u201cfinal\u201d is similar.  \u201cA \u2018final deci-\nsion\u2019 is typically one \u2018by which a district court disasso-\nciates itself from a case.\u2019\u201d  Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. \nCarpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106 (2009). \nUnder the ordinary meaning of \u201cfinal,\u201d there was \nno \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d in petitioner\u2019s case until \nthe Board\u2019s decision.  That decision constituted the \n\u201cend result\u201d of the administrative process, and it com-\npleted the administrative work by accomplishing the \n\u201cdisposit[ion] of the entire case.\u201d \nThe Board\u2019s order was also \u201cfinal\u201d according to this \nCourt\u2019s elaboration of finality for judicial review.  The \nadministrative process was not \u201cconsummat[ed]\u201d until \nthat point; as the course of the proceedings show, \nthere was more work for administrative adjudicators \nto do.  Neither DOJ nor DHS \u201cdissociated\u201d itself from \nthe case; both continued to engage in administrative \nprocess\u2014DOJ as adjudicator, and DHS by filing and \nprosecuting the Board appeal.  Port of Boston asks \nwhether judicial review at an earlier point would \u201cdis-\nrupt the ordinary process of adjudication.\u201d  It surely \nwould have done so here:  Had petitioner sought judi-\ncial review earlier, DOJ would have defended some \nprior intermediate order in court while simultane-\nously acting as an administrative tribunal in the same \nproceeding. \n\n32 \nWith respect to the FARO, the Board\u2019s decision \nmarks the point of finality.  This Court has \u201clong \ntaken\u201d a \u201cpragmatic\u2019 approach\u201d regarding finality.  \nArmy Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, \n599 (2016).  The FARO could not be executed as writ-\nten until the completion of further administrative pro-\ncesses.  DHS and DOJ regulations bar a person\u2019s de-\nportation \u201cbefore a decision is rendered on [the] asy-\nlum application,\u201d and while a Board appeal is pend-\ning.  8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a);6 see also 8 C.F.R. 1003.6(a).  \nWhatever removal might eventually be carried out \nmight well change depending on what the Board de-\ncides about withholding:  If a noncitizen receives with-\nholding, DHS might then designate a different depor-\ntation destination (to the extent 8 U.S.C. 1231(b) per-\nmits), and would revise the FARO accordingly.  More-\nover, the FARO specifically ordered petitioner \u201cre-\nmoved from the United States to Jamaica.\u201d  App. 8a.  \nThat order could not be carried out before DOJ com-\npleted its review of petitioner\u2019s contentions that he \nwould be killed upon his forced return to Jamaica.   \nThis understanding of the finality of the FARO is \nsimilar to how lower courts understand the review of \nordinary removal proceedings.  After an IJ determines \nremovability, the Board\u2019s decision starts the 30-day \nclock, because, by finishing the agency appeal, the \nBoard\u2019s decision \u201celiminates the impediments to re-\nmoval.\u201d  Solano-Chicas v. Gonzales, 440 F.3d 1050, \n1054 (8th Cir. 2006); Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, 450 \nF.3d 596, 600\u2013601 (5th Cir. 2006) (agreeing with \nSolano-Chicas).  The Board\u2019s order renders the IJ\u2019s or-\n6 The term \u201casylum application\u201d includes a request for \nwithholding.  8 C.F.R. 1208.1(a)(1). \n\n33 \nder final by \u201celiminating the impediment to that or-\nder\u2019s enforcement.\u201d  Lolong v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d \n1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, \u201calthough a \nCAT order does not determine whether a noncitizen \ncan be removed, it does determine where that noncit-\nizen can be sent.\u201d  F.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th 620, \n634 (7th Cir. 2024).  \u201cThe indeterminacy of where . . . \nsuggests that the [removal] order might yet leave \nsomething \u2018to be looked for or expected,\u2019 subject to pos-\nsible alteration.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, had petitioner\u2019s case re-\nsulted in deferral of removal, an immigration officer \nmight then have designated a different country (if \nthere is some other permissible destination).7  \u201cConse-\nquently, the plain meaning of \u2018final\u2019 points us toward \nthe conclusion that a [removal] order does not become \nfinal for purposes of judicial review until the agency \nhas also concluded withholding proceedings.\u201d  Id.\nGiven the indeterminacy of where the noncitizen will \nbe removed, a noncitizen\u2019s \u201crights, obligations, and \n[the order\u2019s] legal consequences\u201d are \u201cnot fully deter-\nmined until the reasonable fear and withholding of re-\nmoval proceedings are complete.\u201d  Luna-Garcia v. \nHolder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 (10th Cir. 2015).  Simi-\nlarly, agency action is ordinarily not final if it is only \n\u201cthe ruling of a subordinate official.\u201d  Franklin v. Mas-\nsachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992).  That there are \nadministrative bodies\u2014the IJ and then the Board\u2014\nwhose activities bar enforcement of the FARO as writ-\nten shows the immigration officer is \u201csubordinate\u201d in \nthat sense. \n7 8 U.S.C. 1231(b) details where a noncitizen can be \ndeported.   \n\n34 \nIn petitioner\u2019s case, the Board actually ordered re-\nmoval itself.  The Board\u2019s order says so on its face:  \n\u201c[T]he applicant is ordered removed from the United \nStates to Jamaica.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  That was an \u201corder \nof removal.\u201d  And it was the last such order that could \nor would be issued in petitioner\u2019s proceeding, the \u201clast \nin a series\u201d and last in the \u201cprocess.\u201d   \nB. The context confirms the ordinary usage \nof \u201cfinal\u201d in Section 1252(b)(1). \n1. Congress understood the traditional \nconcept of finality from decades of prec-\nedent. \nThe consistency with which this Court has under-\nstood the concept of finality, across many different \ncontexts\u2014appellate review of district courts, circuit-\ncourt review of agency orders, the APA\u2014goes beyond \nestablishing a body of precedent governing the Court\u2019s \ninterpretation of \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d today.  That \nbody of law informed Congress when it used the term \nin IIRIRA. \n\u201cWhen a statutory term is \u2018obviously transplanted \nfrom another legal source,\u2019 it \u2018brings the old soil with \nit.\u2019\u201d  Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. 554, 560 (2019).  \nTaggart used that principle to conclude that a provi-\nsion stating a bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge order \u201cop-\nerates as an injunction\u201d carried with it the \u201c\u2018potent \nweapon\u2019 of civil contempt\u201d and the \u201ctraditional stand-\nards in equity\u201d for civil contempt.  Id. at 560\u2013561.  \nHall v. Hall used the same principle to import, into \nthe word \u201cconsolidate\u201d in the Federal Rules, pre-Rules \ndoctrines about consolidation.  584 U.S. 59, 72\u201373 \n(2018).   \n\n35 \nSimilarly, what makes a decision \u201cfinal\u201d was well-\nunderstood, through cases like Chicago Southern and \nPort of Boston, when Congress enacted Section \n1252(b)(1).  Indeed, just one year before IIRIRA, the \nCourt issued an extensive discussion of the concept of \nfinality in the INA.  Stone, 514 U.S. at 395\u2013396.  Stone\ndiscussed whether a motion for reconsideration ren-\nders an agency decision nonfinal, and explained that \nthe traditional answer is yes under both the APA and \nthe Hobbs Act.  Id. at 392\u2013393.  The Court further \nnoted that because the INA generally incorporates \nHobbs Act procedures, the traditional answer would \napply were there no \u201cfurther qualification\u201d in the stat-\nute.  Id.  There was a \u201cfurther qualification\u201d as to re-\nconsideration.  Id. at 395\u2013396.  But Congress was on \nnotice that absent such qualification, traditional \nHobbs Act principles (which are consistent with APA \nfinality) would govern interpretations of the INA. \nTaggart teaches that in IIRIRA, Congress presum-\nably intended a term like \u201cfinal\u201d to carry the meaning \nthat was well-established in Hobbs Act and APA \ncases.  IIRIRA confirms that teaching:  After Stone in-\nvoked Hobbs Act principles, IIRIRA included lan-\nguage expressly invoking the Hobbs Act.  8 U.S.C. \n1252(a)(1).  And the post-1996 INA contains no quali-\nfication pointing away from the traditional meaning \nof \u201cfinal.\u201d    \n2. The structure of Section 1252 confirms \nCongress meant \u201cfinal order\u201d in the or-\ndinary sense. \nFirst, Section 1252(d) specifies that \u201c[a] court may \nreview a final order of removal only if . . . the alien has \nexhausted all administrative remedies.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1252(d)(1).  It would make no sense to require a \n\n36 \nnoncitizen to exhaust administrative remedies if the \norder becomes final before that exhaustion can be \ncompleted.  Rather, Congress must have expected that \nthe order becomes final only after the noncitizen has \nthe opportunity to attempt administrative remedies.  \nThat understanding is consistent with the ordinary \nmeaning of finality, in which the order becomes final \nat the end of the administrative process.   \nWhen petitioner received the FARO, administra-\ntive remedies were available to him, namely request-\ning adjudication of his fear of torture.8  While the IJ \nfound him removable, the IJ provided the protection \nhe requested and the FARO remained on hold while \nDHS appealed the IJ\u2019s decision.  Had Congress in-\ntended the FARO to count as \u201cfinal\u201d while further ad-\nministrative process remained available, Section 1252 \nwould be internally incoherent. \nSecond, the zipper clause requires all judicial re-\nview, in \u201cany . . . proceeding brought to remove [a \nnoncitizen],\u201d to be conducted through \u201cjudicial review \nof a final order under this section.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(9).  This provision means \u201ca noncitizen\u2019s vari-\nous challenges arising from the removal proceeding \nmust be \u2018consolidated in a petition for review.\u2019\u201d  \nNasrallah, 590 U.S. at 580.  \u201cCongress intended the \n8 Paragraph (d)(1) demands exhaustion of \u201call admin-\nistrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d  \nIt does not limit or qualify that scope to remedies al-\ntering the conclusion as to removability or affecting \nthe validity of the removability decision.  \u201cAll\u201d is an \nencompassing word; and seeking CAT relief was an \nadministrative remedy available to petitioner by \nright. \n\n37 \nzipper clause to \u2018consolidate judicial review of immi-\ngration proceedings into one action in the court of ap-\npeals.\u2019\u201d  Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 230.  Since \nCongress has also said that CAT claims are to be re-\nviewed as part of the \u201creview of a final order of re-\nmoval,\u201d FARRA \u00a7 2242(d), it surely contemplated that \nthe order of removal and the CAT order would become \nfinal at the same time.  Otherwise, the zipper clause \nand the judicial review prescribed by section (a)(4) \nwould be mutually incompatible.  DOJ could simply \nissue a CAT-only decision more than 30 days after the \nlast decision with a removability dispute,9 so that ei-\nther there would have to be two separate cases\u2014un-\ndermining the zipper clause\u2014or alternatively the zip-\nper clause would defeat judicial review of the CAT de-\ncision.  Congress could not have intended that result, \ngiven the REAL ID Act simultaneously amended the \nzipper clause to block habeas cases and clarified that \ncircuit courts review CAT decisions alongside removal \norders.   \nThird, after Stone alerted Congress that Hobbs Act \ndoctrines would apply to the INA absent contrary in-\ndications, IIRIRA reiterated Congress\u2019s reference to \nthe Hobbs Act and identified specific exceptions.  Per \nSection 1252(a)(1), the Hobbs Act generally governs \nreview of final orders of removal, \u201cexcept as provided \nin subsection (b).\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1).  Subsection (b) \nalters the Hobbs Act timeline for judicial review (30 \ndays after the final order); it changes the venue and \nthe means for service upon the government; it adjusts \nthe standard of review; and it mandates consolidating \n9 This would be possible for any case, not just for a \nnoncitizen undergoing Section 1228 removal, such as \nso-called \u201cmixed cases.\u201d See infra n.11.  \n\n38 \na petition from a motion to reconsider with the peti-\ntion from the original order, repeating the qualifica-\ntion on which Stone relied.  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1)\u2013(4), \n(6).  Nothing in subsection (b) signals other changes to \nwhat constitutes a final order.   \nParticularly, neither subsection (b) nor anything \nelse in Section 1252 establishes an exception to final-\nity for Section 1228(b) proceedings, comparable to the \n(b)(6) alteration for reconsideration motions ad-\ndressed in Stone.  Congress could, for example, have \nsaid review of a CAT order \u201cshall be consolidated\u201d \nwith review of an administrative-removal order, thus \nsignaling these are two petitions filed at different \ntimes.  But Congress chose differently, and \u201cit is not \nfor us to rewrite the statute,\u201d Hall v. United States, \n566 U.S. 506, 523 (2012). \nCongress specified how Section 1252 deviates from \nHobbs Act principles and said those were the only de-\npartures.  So the traditional, ordinary concept of final-\nity is all the more imperative.   \n3. The definition of \u201corder of deportation\u201d \ndoes not displace the ordinary meaning \nof \u201cfinal.\u201d \nThat Section 1101 says an \u201corder of deportation\u201d \n\u201cshall become final\u201d\u2019 upon a Board decision \u201caffirming \nsuch order\u201d or the expiration of a noncitizen\u2019s time to \nseek Board appeal, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47)(B), does not \nalter this conclusion.  The paragraph (47)(B) state-\nment is consistent with ordinary principles of finality \nand does not necessitate a departure from them.  The \n\n39 \nBoard is the final decisionmaking body in many re-\nmoval proceedings, so naturally an order becomes fi-\nnal upon the Board\u2019s decision.10\nWhile statutory definitions are \u201cvirtually conclu-\nsive,\u201d Garland v. Cargill, 602 U.S. 406, 428, n.9 \n(2024), paragraph (47)(B) is not actually a definition.  \nUnlike most other clauses in Section 1101, (47)(B) \ndoes not say a term \u201cmeans\u201d something or \u201cincludes\u201d \na set of things.  Indeed, paragraph (47)(B) stands next \nto (47)(A) that says \u201corder of deportation\u201d \u201cmeans\u201d a \ncertain type of order, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47)(A), yet \n(47)(B) does not use the \u201cmeans\u201d formulation.  \n\u201c[W]here [a] document has used one term in one place, \nand a materially different term in another, the pre-\nsumption is that the different term denotes a different \nidea.\u201d  Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, \n457\u2013458 (2022) (citation omitted).  That presumption \nis all the stronger here, because \u201cCongress well knows \nthe difference\u201d between a definition and a substantive \nprovision.  Cyan v. Beaver County Employees Retire-\nment Fund, 583 U.S. 416, 418 (2018).  Thus, while par-\nagraph (47)(A) defines the term \u201corder of deportation,\u201d \nclause (B) simply mandates two circumstances in \nwhich such an order becomes final.  It does not pur-\nport to define finality for judicial-review purposes.  In \nfact, it cannot because the two circumstances identi-\nfied\u2014a Board decision \u201caffirming\u201d or the expiration of \n10 These realities do not make paragraph (47) super-\nfluous.  If nothing else, regulations, not statutes cre-\nated the Board, 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(a); so absent para-\ngraph (47), DOJ could eliminate the Board and render \nthe next lower decisionmaker final.   \n\n40 \nthe deadline without an appeal\u2014do not cover situa-\ntions (such as this case) when the noncitizen prevails \nbefore the IJ and DHS appeals and obtains a reversal. \nC. Nothing in Section 1252 overrides the \npresumption of judicial review. \n\u201cCongress rarely intends to prevent courts from \nenforcing its directives to federal agencies.\u201d  Mach \nMining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. 480, 486 (2015).  Con-\nsequently \u201c[t]his Court has long recognized a \u2018strong \npresumption\u2019 in favor of judicial review of final agency \naction.\u201d  American Hospital Assn. v. Becerra, 596 U.S. \n724, 733 (2022).  Because that presumption is \u201c\u2018well-\nsettled,\u2019 . . . the Court assumes that \u2018Congress legis-\nlates with knowledge of\u2019 the presumption.\u201d  Kucana v. \nHolder, 558 U.S. 233, 251\u2013252 (2010).  \u201c[T]he burden \nfor rebutting it is heavy,\u201d Smith, 587 U.S. at 483, and \nit \u201ccan only be overcome by \u2018clear and convincing evi-\ndence\u2019 of congressional intent to preclude judicial re-\nview.\u201d  Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229.  The Court \nhas \u201cconsistently applied that interpretive guide to \nlegislation regarding immigration, and particularly to \nquestions concerning the preservation of federal-court \njurisdiction.\u201d  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 251.   \nThus, Congress intended courts to review the exec-\nutive branch\u2019s decisions about eligibility for CAT pro-\ntection.  There is unquestionably a \u201cmeaningful stand-\nard\u201d to be reviewed, cf. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United \nStates Fish and Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018) \n(holding APA exception for \u201cmatters committed to \nagency discretion\u201d is \u201cread . . . quite narrowly\u201d).  If a \nnoncitizen proves he will likely be tortured in the des-\nignated country of removal, FARRA and DOJ regula-\ntions prohibit deporting him there.  8 C.F.R. \n1208.16(d), 1208.17(a).  DOJ \u201chas no discretion to \n\n41 \ndeny [CAT] relief to a noncitizen who establishes his \neligibility.\u201d  Moncrieffe, 569 U.S. at 187, n.1.  Conse-\nquently, a determination that a noncitizen failed the \nlegal test is \u201cthe sort of routine dispute that federal \ncourts regularly review.\u201d  Weyerhaeuser, 586 U.S. at \n23.   \n\u201cIndependent judicial review\u201d is particularly justi-\nfied \u201cin an area where administrative decisions can \nmean the difference between freedom and oppression \nand, quite possibly, life and death.\u201d  Rodriguez-Roman\nv. INS, 98 F.3d 416, 432 (9th Cir. 1996) (Kozinski, J., \nconcurring).  Administrative errors do occur.  Over \n10,500 Board decisions have been remanded by circuit \ncourts since 2014.  Adjudication Statistics: Circuit \nCourt Remands Filed, Executive Office for Immigra-\ntion Review (July 19, 2024).  Argueta-Hernandez v.\nGarland, 87 F.4th 698 (5th Cir. 2023), corrected an er-\nror about CAT protection, because the Board disre-\ngarded \u201csustained\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d death threats.  Id. \nat 708.  The Fourth Circuit too has found errors in \nCAT decisions.  E.g., Zavaleta-Policiano v. Sessions, \n873 F.3d 241, 248 (4th Cir. 2017) (\u201c[T]he IJ and \n[Board] failed to appreciate, or even address, critical \nevidence in the record.\u201d).  Such errors, when uncor-\nrected, place the United States in violation of its in-\nternational obligations under CAT and of Congress\u2019s \nstated policy against delivering individuals to face tor-\nture.  For issues \u201ccritical to determining whether the \nnoncitizen is likely to be tortured if returned, it makes \nsome sense that Congress would provide an oppor-\ntunity for judicial review.\u201d  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at 586.\nThere is no indication\u2014much less \u201cclear and con-\nvincing evidence\u201d\u2014that Congress intended to bar \nsuch review.  In fact, Congress twice said the opposite.  \n\n42 \n\u201cSection 2242(d) of FARRA . . . expressly provides for \njudicial review of CAT claims together with the review \nof final orders of removal.\u201d  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n586.  Then the REAL ID Act \u201cprovide[d] for direct re-\nview of CAT orders in the courts of appeals.\u201d  Id.  Sec-\ntion 1252 restricts judicial review in other ways.  8 \nU.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A), (B), (D).  \u201cIt would be easy \nenough for Congress to preclude judicial review\u201d of \nwithholding decisions, just as it imposed those other \nrestrictions.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at 583.  Congress \n\u201chas not done so,\u201d id., and the Court must therefore \ninterpret Section 1252 to allow judicial review of those \ndecisions. \nInterpreting \u201cfinal order of removal\u201d to occur be-\nfore the completion of the administrative process \nwould contravene the presumption by \u201cforeclosing re-\nview of CAT orders\u201d for whole categories of removal \ncases, particularly for noncitizens who are ineligible \nfor other relief or protection.  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 635. \nIt would make the \u201cpromise of judicial review of \nagency action\u201d \u201cillusory\u201d given the structure of the ad-\nministrative proceedings which make it \u201cimpossible\u201d \nto seek review within 30 days of the FARO.  See Ines-\ntroza-Tosta, 105 F.4th at 514.  Once a FARO is issued \nand a noncitizen expresses a fear of returning to the \ndesignated country, the immigration officer has 10 \ndays to carry out the reasonable-fear interview.  8 \nC.F.R. 1208.31(a)\u2013(b), (g).  So there can easily be 10 \ndays from the FARO before the IJ hearing even starts.  \nAfter the IJ, either party can appeal to the Board, and \nthat appeal must be filed within 30 days.  8 C.F.R. \n1003.3(a)(1)\u2013(2), 1003.38(b).  After the Board receives \nthe IJ\u2019s record, DHS and the noncitizen have 21 days \nto file their briefs.  8 C.F.R. 1003.3(c)(1).  This sched-\n\n43 \nule makes it impossible to have a decision about with-\nholding, to be judicially reviewed, within 30 days of \nthe FARO.  And that leaves out the time for the Board \nto decide the appeal.   \nMoreover, as a practical matter \u201cwithholding and \nCAT proceedings often take months or even years to \nconclude,\u201d so that many noncitizens \u201ccannot obtain ju-\ndicial review\u201d under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach.  \nMartinez, 86 F.4th at 574 (Floyd, J., concurring).  Pe-\ntitioner\u2019s case illustrates the timelines.  He received \nthe FARO on January 28, 2021.  The IJ granted CAT \nprotection on July 27, six months later; and DHS filed \nits appeal on August 25.  The Board\u2019s decision was 10 \nmonths later, on May 31, 2022.  That timeframe was \nquite ordinary.  For example, in Tadeo v. Garland, the \nBoard\u2019s decision came 11 months after the FARO.  No. \n22-60462, 2024 WL 2780230, at *1 (5th Cir. May 30, \n2024).  In Sanabria Morales v. Barr, the gap was 26 \nmonths.  967 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 2020).  Thus, con-\ncluding that an order of removal becomes \u201cfinal\u201d when \nDHS issues the FARO would preclude judicial review \nof the decision that the Board subsequently makes \nabout withholding.11\n11 Interpreting finality to occur before completion of \nthe administrative process would create problems in \nmany other circumstances.  For example, the Board \nsometimes affirms the conclusion that a noncitizen is \nremovable but remands to the IJ for further proceed-\nings on withholding of removal.  See, e.g., Chupina v. \nHolder, 570 F.3d 99, 103\u2013104 (2d Cir. 2009) (per cu-\nriam).  Necessarily, the Board\u2019s decision about with-\nholding would come after the conclusion of the remand \n\n44 \nThis Court has repeatedly applied the presump-\ntion of judicial review to ensure \u201cmeaningful judicial \nreview\u201d before the removal of noncitizens.  Guerrero-\nLasprilla, 589 U.S. 230.  Guerrero-Lasprilla inter-\npreted \u201cquestions of law\u201d to encompass mixed ques-\ntions of law and fact.  589 U.S. 221.  The Court did so \nbecause \u201cinterpreting the Limited Review Provision to \nexclude mixed questions would effectively foreclose ju-\ndicial review of the Board\u2019s determinations so long as \nit announced the correct legal standard.\u201d  Id. at 229\u2013\n230.  Kucana explained that \u201c[s]eparation-of-powers \nconcerns . . . caution us against reading legislation, \nabsent clear statement, to place in executive hands \nauthority to remove cases from the Judiciary\u2019s do-\nmain.\u201d  558 U.S. at 237.  Interpreting \u201cfinal order of \nremoval\u201d to mean an early stage of the administrative \nprocess would run against these teachings.  A with-\nholding claim presents a dispute about the application \nof a binding legal standard to a given individual\u2019s \ncase.  Congress did not intend to eliminate judicial re-\nview on such matters simply because DOJ regula-\ntions\u2014or even agency workload\u2014cause this dispute \nto take longer than the 30-day deadline for seeking re-\nview.  \nproceeding.  If the Board\u2019s remand order (the last de-\ncision with a removability dispute) were the \u201cfinal or-\nder of removal,\u201d the subsequent withholding decision \nwould be more than 30 days later.  The Court should \n\u201chesitate before finding that Congress vested the ex-\necutive branch with the authority to shape the scope \nof . . . review so drastically.\u201d  F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 637, \nn.10. \n\n45 \nD. Nasrallah does not require the Court to \nreject the ordinary meaning of \u201cfinal.\u201d \nWhile most lower courts have applied the ordinary \nmeaning of \u201cfinal\u201d to determine when the 1252(b)(1) \nclock starts, the Fourth Circuit rejected that approach \nbased on a misinterpretation of Nasrallah.  Nothing \nin Nasrallah supports, much less requires, treating an \nintermediate, inferior agency decision as the final or-\nder of removal. \n1. An order can mark the final removal \norder while also deciding CAT protec-\ntion. \nNasrallah explained the difference between an \u201cor-\nder of removal\u201d and a CAT order.  An \u201corder of re-\nmoval\u201d is an order \u201cconcluding that the alien is deport-\nable or ordering deportation.\u201d 590 U.S. at 581 (citing \n8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47)(A)).12  A CAT order, by contrast, \n12 Nasrallah also said \u201cfinal orders of removal encom-\npass only the rulings made by the immigration judge \nor Board of Immigration Appeals that affect the valid-\nity of the final order of removal.\u201d  590 U.S. at 582.  \nThis sentence is circular and cannot logically be a \nholding about what constitutes a final order of re-\nmoval.  \u201c\u2018[T]he language of an opinion is not always to \nbe parsed as though we were dealing with language of \na statute,\u2019\u201d but rather must be \u201cread with a careful eye \nto context\u201d about what \u201cdiscrete case[] or con-\ntrovers[y]\u201d was addressed.  National Pork Producers \nCouncil v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 373\u2013374 (2023).  \nNasrallah was explaining the difference between re-\nmoval and CAT orders, rather than determining what \nmakes an order final or ruling that only an IJ or the \nBoard can issue a final order of removal. \n\n46 \n\u201cmeans only that . . . the noncitizen may not be re-\nmoved to the designated country of removal, at least \nuntil conditions change.\u201d Id. at 582.  In that respect, \nthe two types of decision do not merge for purposes of \nthe Section 1252(a)(2)(C) limitation on judicial review. \nIbid; see also Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 539 (ex-\nplaining removal and withholding are \u201cdistinct ques-\ntions\u201d that \u201cend in two separate orders\u201d). \nThat these two orders are \u201cseparate\u201d in a logical \nsense does not mean a document denying CAT protec-\ntion cannot also include or coincide with a \u201cfinal order \nof removal.\u201d  The Fourth Circuit thinks a given deci-\nsion must be either a final removal order or a CAT or-\nder, but not both. That false dichotomy contradicts \nboth Nasrallah\u2019s reasoning and DOJ\u2019s protocols. \nIndeed, Nasrallah rejected the contention that a \nsingle document must be one thing or the other.  The \nCourt analogized removal and withholding proceed-\nings to a criminal case.  That both the conviction and \nthe sentence must be completed before the defendant \ncan appeal does not mean the conviction is the same \nas the sentence.  590 U.S. at 583.  A conviction and \nsentence are finalized in a single document of judg-\nment; in the same way, DOJ determinations on re-\nmovability and withholding do not merge but may be \ncontained in a single document. \nThat functional approach is borne out by DOJ reg-\nulations and protocol.  In full-dress removal proceed-\nings, the adjudicator\u2019s decisions with respect to both \nremovability and CAT withholding (if requested) are \ndetailed in a single order that is both a \u201cfinal order of \nremoval\u201d and a CAT order.  See generally 8 C.F.R. \n1240.11; 8 C.F.R. 1240.15.  Board precedent requires \n\n47 \nthat an order of removal accompany a withholding de-\ncision.  Matter of I-S- & C-S-, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 434 \n(\u201c[W]hen an Immigration Judge decides to grant with-\nholding of removal, an explicit order of removal must \nbe included in the decision.\u201d). \n2. The resolution of a withholding claim \nalso marks the final removal order. \nAn immigration officer issues a FARO that \n(1) finds the noncitizen removable, and (2) \u201cdesig-\nnate[s] the country of removal.\u201d  8 C.F.R. 238.1(f)(2).  \nThat second aspect of the FARO triggers the process \nto request withholding or deferral as to the designated \ncountry.  That application halts the order and entitles \nthe noncitizen to a proceeding before an IJ and poten-\ntially before the Board.  8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a) (noncitizen \n\u201cshall not be excluded, deported, or removed before a \ndecision is rendered on his or her asylum applica-\ntion\u201d); 8 C.F.R. 1003.6(a) (no decision \u201cshall . . . be ex-\necuted while an appeal is pending\u201d before the Board).  \nGuzman Chavez observed that during this process a \nFARO \u201cremains in full force,\u201d and DHS retains the \nstatutory authority to eventually deport a noncitizen \nto a different country.  594 U.S. at 536; 8 C.F.R. \n1208.16(f) (grant of withholding or deferral does not \n\u201cprevent [DHS] from removing\u201d to a different country \nnot covered by the withholding or deferral).  But the \nFARO, though in force, is on hold, 8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a); \nand before removing to a different country DHS would \nneed to amend the FARO or otherwise designate that \nother country, 8 C.F.R. 238.1(f)(2) (thus ensuring the \nnoncitizen\u2019s opportunity to raise grounds for with-\nholding or deferral about that country).  \nIf the process ends in a denial of CAT relief, that \noutcome allows the removal to proceed.  While that \n\n48 \ndenial is not itself a decision about the validity of re-\nmoval, it is, in such cases, a necessary predicate for \nthe removal to be carried out as ordered.  A removal \norder that cannot be carried out because of ongoing \nadministrative adjudication is not \u201cfinal,\u201d any more \nthan a conviction is \u201cfinal\u201d before the sentence is de-\ncided. \nDOJ followed precisely that process in petitioner\u2019s \ncase.  The immigration officer issued a FARO ordering \npetitioner removed to Jamaica.  App. 7a.  Petitioner \nthen applied for withholding, which halted the order \nof removal under 8 C.F.R. 1208.5(a).  The IJ granted \npetitioner\u2019s request for deferral under CAT; but on ap-\npeal the Board reversed and \u201cordered [petitioner] re-\nmoved from the United States to Jamaica.\u201d  Pet. App. \n14a. \nConsistent with Nasrallah, the Board\u2019s order was \na single document that encompassed both removal \nand withholding.  It was the agency\u2019s final decision on \nCAT protection.  At the same time, the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion rendered the original order of removal (the \nFARO) \u201cfinal,\u201d because the Board\u2019s decision was the \nnecessary step to bring the FARO to fruition.  The \nBoard\u2019s order was also itself an \u201corder of removal\u201d be-\ncause it was a document \u201cordering deportation,\u201d 590 \nU.S. at 581 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47)(a)).  It did so \nexplicitly.  But even without that language, the re-\nmoval order would still be implicit, because the \nBoard\u2019s decision ended the stay of petitioner\u2019s removal \nunder 8 C.F.R. 1003.6(a).  There is no inconsistency in \nholding there was no final order of removal until this \npoint even though the denial of CAT protection was \nnot, in itself, such an order.   \n\n49 \nE. Guzman Chavez did not decide when an \norder of removal is \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \njudicial review. \nThe Fourth Circuit leans heavily on Guzman \nChavez in concluding that DHS administrative orders \nare \u201cfinal\u201d upon issuance.  Martinez, 86 F.4th at 569.  \nThat reliance is erroneous because Guzman Chavez\nexpressly disclaimed any position about Section 1252 \nand interpreted a term different from \u201cfinal order of \nremoval.\u201d \nGuzman Chavez decided which of two statutes gov-\nerns the detention of noncitizens subject to reinstated \nremoval orders who then pursue withholding-only re-\nlief.  The Court chose 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B), which \n\u201cauthorizes detention \u2018when [a noncitizen] is ordered \nremoved\u201d and the order has \u201cbecome[] administra-\ntively final.\u2019\u201d 594 U.S. at 533.  The reinstated removal \norder is \u201cadministratively final\u201d because the nonciti-\nzen is not entitled to contest removal further. Id.\nThe Court acknowledged the phrase \u201cadministra-\ntively final\u201d is \u201cdifferent language\u201d from what appears \nin Section 1252, and addresses a different function, \nnamely detention rather than judicial review.  594 \nU.S. at 535, n.6.  Consequently, the Court said it \u201cex-\npress[ed] no view\u201d about the proper interpretation of \n\u201cfinal order of removal\u201d in Section 1252.  Id.\n\u201cHolding that a reinstated removal order is final \nfor purposes of an IJ\u2019s consideration of detention does \nnot answer whether it is final for purposes of circuit \ncourt review of the outcome of withholding-only pro-\nceedings.\u201d  Arostegui-Maldonado v. Garland, 75 F.4th \n1132, 1143 (10th Cir. 2023).  The difference in statu-\n\n50 \ntory language suggests the opposite.  The word \u201cad-\nministratively\u201d in Section 1231(a)(1)(B) must have \nmeaning.  \u201cEquating finality in \u00a7 1231 with \n\u00a7 1252(b)(1) renders \u2018administratively\u2019 superfluous.\u201d  \nF.J.A.P., 94 F.4th at 632.  Conversely, under the \n\u201cmeaningful-variation canon,\u201d Congress\u2019s deliberate \nomission of \u201cadministratively\u201d in Section 1252 neces-\nsarily \u201cdenotes a different idea.\u201d  See Southwest Air-\nlines, 596 U.S. at 457\u2013458.   \nThe notion that a decision can be \u201cadministratively \nfinal\u201d without being final for judicial review is famil-\niar in administrative law.  For example, Fritsch v. ICC\nconsidered an agency decision that was \u201cadministra-\ntively final\u201d but was subject to a request for reopening.  \n59 F.3d 248, 250 (D.C. Cir. 1995).  That reopening re-\nquest made the case non-final for purposes of judicial \nreview under this Court\u2019s precedents, and the D.C. \nCircuit held that it could review the substance of the \ndecision on reopening.  Id. at 252.  Thus, \u201cadministra-\ntively final\u201d was a status within the administrative \nprocess, not a determination about finality for judicial \nreview.  Guzman Chavez said the same about Section \n1231(a)(1)(B):  \u201cBy using the word \u2018administratively,\u2019 \nCongress focused our attention on the agency\u2019s review \nproceedings, separate and apart from any judicial re-\nview proceedings that may occur in a court.\u201d  594 U.S. \nat 534.  By contrast, \u201c[w]hether an administrative de-\ncision is final\u201d for purposes of judicial review \u201cis deter-\nmined not \u2018by the administrative agency\u2019s characteri-\nzation of its action, but rather by a realistic assess-\nment of the nature and effect of the order sought to be \nreviewed,\u2019\u201d Adenariwo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, \n808 F.3d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2015)\u2014an assessment gov-\nerned by the traditional understanding of finality in \nthis Court\u2019s precedents.  \n\n51 \nA FARO is \u201cadministratively final\u201d in that the \nagencies have concluded a pertinent stage in their ad-\nministrative process.  It is not final for judicial review \nbecause there are, nonetheless, further administra-\ntive processes to be carried out. \nF. The Fourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of fi-\nnality upends the orderly process of judi-\ncial review. \nNoncitizens could attempt to preserve judicial re-\nview of withholding/deferral claims by first filing a \nplaceholder petition for review within 30 days of the \ninitial administrative order, which the court could \nthen hold in abeyance, then filing a second petition af-\nter the Board decision on withholding, and later seek-\ning to consolidate the second petition with the first.  \nOr a noncitizen could, upon receiving a decision deny-\ning withholding, file a request that DHS reissue the \nadministrative-removal order, so as to retrigger the \n30-day clock for the Fourth Circuit.   \nEven assuming a noncitizen can obtain judicial re-\nview by these techniques, these would be absurdly in-\nefficient if pursued across the board.  \u201cIt would lead to \nan increase in filings, as petitioners would inevitably \nhave to file a petition for review to preserve the \npossibility of judicial review, even when unsure if they \nwould need to, or even choose to, challenge the \ndecision in the future,\u201d which in turn \u201cwould require \n[the courts of appeals] to dedicate resources to \ntracking and closing moot or abandoned petitions\u201d \nand \u201cto establish a system of holding petitions for \nreview in abeyance for years at a time.\u201d  Alonso-Jua-\nrez, 80 F.4th at 1053. \n\n52 \nThe REAL ID Act was supposed to make judicial \nreview more efficient, not less.  See Guerrero-\nLasprilla, 589 U.S. at 235\u2013236.  Congress wanted one \nconsolidated review of all issues at the end of a given \nremoval proceeding.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at 580.  An \ninterpretation that requires premature placeholder \nappeals or widespread motions to reissue administra-\ntive orders undermines that legislative goal and \n\u201cwould be immensely resource intensive\u201d for the judi-\nciary, the government, and noncitizens.  Alonso-Jua-\nrez, 80 F.4th at 1053.13  Indeed, that model raises \nmany of the same concerns as the government\u2019s pro-\nposal (on a different issue) that Santos-Zacaria re-\njected:  It \u201cpresents a world of administrability head-\naches for courts, traps for unwary noncitizens, and \nmountains of [petitions] for the [courts of appeals] \n(filed out of an abundance of caution by noncitizens \nunsure of the need to [petition for appeal]).\u201d  598 U.S. \nat 430.  Congress mandated that review of CAT orders \nshould be available.  The Court should eschew a con-\nstruction of Section 1252 that respects that mandate \nonly by massively multiplying the nation\u2019s immigra-\ntion dockets. \n13 Nor is there evidence that Congress intended to im-\npose this process.  Section 1252 points the opposite di-\nrection, expressly calling for separate petitions, then \nto be consolidated, for one particular administrative \ncircumstance (a motion to reopen). Had Congress \nwanted piecemeal review petitions from other stages \nin the administrative process, Section 1252 would \nhave said so. \n\n53 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \njudgment and remand for further proceedings. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nKEITH BRADLEY\n Counsel of Record\nKAYLA MARIE MENDEZ\n717 17th Street, Suite 1825 \nDenver, CO 80202 \n(303) 830-1776 \nkeith.bradley@squirepb.com\nCHRISTOPHER F.

Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 \n(1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, provides, in relevant part: \n* * * \nArticle 3  \n \n1. No State Party shall expel, return (\u201crefouler\u201d) \nor extradite a person to another State where there are \nsubstantial grounds for believing that he would be in \ndanger of being subjected to torture.   \n \n \n\n2a \n8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(47), Definitions, provides: \n(a) As used in this chapter\u2014 \n(47) \n(A) The term \u201corder of deportation\u201d means the \norder of the special inquiry officer, or other such \nadministrative officer to whom the Attorney Gen-\neral has delegated the responsibility for determin-\ning whether an alien is deportable, concluding \nthat the alien is deportable or ordering deporta-\ntion. \n(B) The order described under subparagraph \n(A) shall become final upon the earlier of\u2014 \n(i) a determination by the Board of Immi-\ngration Appeals affirming such order; or \n(ii) the expiration of the period in which \nthe alien is permitted to seek review of such \norder by the Board of Immigration Appeals. \n \n \n\n3a \nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Re-\nsponsibility Act of 1996, Section 309(d), 110 Stat. \n3009-627 (1996), provides:  \n(d) Transitional References.  \u2014 For purposes \nof carrying out the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nas amended by this subtitle\u2014 \n(1) any reference in section 212(a)(1)(A) of \nsuch Act to the term \u201cinadmissible\u201d is deemed to \ninclude a reference to the term \u201cexcludable\u201d, and \n(2) any reference in law to an order of removal \nshall be deemed to include a reference to an order \nof exclusion and deportation or an order of depor-\ntation. \n \n\n4a \n8 U.S.C. 1228, Expedited removal of aliens convicted \nof committing aggravated felonies, provides: \n(a) Removal of criminal aliens \n(1) In general.  The Attorney General shall \nprovide for the availability of special removal pro-\nceedings at certain Federal, State, and local cor-\nrectional facilities for aliens convicted of any crim-\ninal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), \n(B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered \nby section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which \nboth predicate offenses are, without regard to the \ndate of their commission, otherwise covered by \nsection 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title.  Such proceed-\nings shall be conducted in conformity with section \n1229a of this title (except as otherwise provided in \nthis section), and in a manner which eliminates \nthe need for additional detention at any pro-\ncessing center of the Service and in a manner \nwhich assures expeditious removal following the \nend of the alien's incarceration for the underlying \nsentence.  Nothing in this section shall be con-\nstrued to create any substantive or procedural \nright or benefit that is legally enforceable by any \nparty against the United States or its agencies or \nofficers or any other person. \n(2) Implementation.  With respect to an al-\nien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken \ninto custody by the Attorney General pursuant to \nsection 1226(c) of this title, the Attorney General \nshall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain \nany such felon at a facility at which other such al-\niens are detained. In the selection of such facility, \nthe Attorney General shall make reasonable ef-\nforts to ensure that the alien's access to counsel \n\n5a \nand right to counsel under section 1362 of this ti-\ntle are not impaired. \n(3) Expedited proceedings \n(A) Notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, the Attorney General shall provide for \nthe initiation and, to the extent possible, the \ncompletion of removal proceedings, and any \nadministrative appeals thereof, in the case of \nany alien convicted of an aggravated felony \nbefore the alien's release from incarceration \nfor the underlying aggravated felony. \n(B) Nothing in this section shall be con-\nstrued as requiring the Attorney General to \neffect the removal of any alien sentenced to ac-\ntual incarceration, before release from the \npenitentiary or correctional institution where \nsuch alien is confined. \n(4) Review \n(A) The Attorney General shall review \nand evaluate removal proceedings conducted \nunder this section. \n(B) The Comptroller General shall moni-\ntor, review, and evaluate removal proceedings \nconducted under this section. Within 18 \nmonths after the effective date of this section, \nthe Comptroller General shall submit a report \nto such Committees concerning the extent to \nwhich removal proceedings conducted under \nthis section may adversely affect the ability of \nsuch aliens to contest removal effectively. \n \n \n\n6a \n(b) Removal of aliens who are not permanent \nresidents \n(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of \nan alien described in paragraph (2), determine the \ndeportability \nof \nsuch \nalien \nunder \nsection \n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to convic-\ntion of an aggravated felony) and issue an order of \nremoval pursuant to the procedures set forth in \nthis subsection or section 1229a of this title. \n(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if \nthe alien- \n(A) was not lawfully admitted for perma-\nnent residence at the time at which proceed-\nings under this section commenced; or \n(B) had permanent resident status on a \nconditional basis (as described in section \n1186a of this title) at the time that proceed-\nings under this section commenced. \n(3) The Attorney General may not execute any \norder described in paragraph (1) until 14 calendar \ndays have passed from the date that such order \nwas issued, unless waived by the alien, in order \nthat the alien has an opportunity to apply for ju-\ndicial review under section 1252 of this title. \n(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General \nunder this subsection shall be in accordance with \nsuch regulations as the Attorney General shall \nprescribe. The Attorney General shall provide \nthat- \n(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of \nthe charges and of the opportunity described \nin subparagraph (C); \n\n7a \n(B) the alien shall have the privilege of be-\ning represented (at no expense to the govern-\nment) by such counsel, authorized to practice \nin such proceedings, as the alien shall choose; \n(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity \nto inspect the evidence and rebut the charges; \n(D) a determination is made for the record \nthat the individual upon whom the notice for \nthe proceeding under this section is served (ei-\nther in person or by mail) is, in fact, the alien \nnamed in such notice; \n(E) a record is maintained for judicial re-\nview; and \n(F) the final order of removal is not adju-\ndicated by the same person who issues the \ncharges. \n(5) No alien described in this section shall be \neligible for any relief from removal that the Attor-\nney General may grant in the Attorney General's \ndiscretion. \n(c)1 Presumption of deportability.  An alien \nconvicted of an aggravated felony shall be conclusively \npresumed to be deportable from the United States. \n* * *  \n \n \n1 So in original.  Two subsecs.

The alien shall serve \nand file a brief in connection with a petition \nfor judicial review not later than 40 days after \nthe date on which the administrative record is \navailable, and may serve and file a reply brief \nnot later than 14 days after service of the brief \nof the Attorney General, and the court may \nnot extend these deadlines except upon mo-\ntion for good cause shown.

If the validity of an \norder of removal has not been judicially \ndecided, a defendant in a criminal pro-\nceeding charged with violating section \n1253(a) of this title may challenge the va-\nlidity of the order in the criminal proceed-\ning only by filing a separate motion before \n\n15a \ntrial. The district court, without a jury, \nshall decide the motion before trial. \n(B) Claims of United States na-\ntionality.  If the defendant claims in the \nmotion to be a national of the United \nStates and the district court finds that\u2014 \n(i) no genuine issue of material \nfact about the defendant\u2019s nationality \nis presented, the court shall decide the \nmotion only on the administrative rec-\nord on which the removal order is \nbased and the administrative findings \nof fact are conclusive if supported by \nreasonable, substantial, and proba-\ntive evidence on the record considered \nas a whole; or \n(ii) a genuine issue of material \nfact about the defendant\u2019s nationality \nis presented, the court shall hold a \nnew hearing on the nationality claim \nand decide that claim as if an action \nhad been brought under section 2201 \nof title 28. \nThe defendant may have such na-\ntionality claim decided only as pro-\nvided in this subparagraph. \n(C) Consequence of invalidation.  \nIf the district court rules that the removal \norder is invalid, the court shall dismiss \nthe indictment for violation of section \n1253(a) of this title.

The defendant in a criminal \nproceeding under section 1253(a) of this ti-\ntle may not file a petition for review under \nsubsection (a) during the criminal pro-\nceeding. \n(8) Construction.  This subsection\u2014 \n(A) does not prevent the Attorney \nGeneral, after a final order of removal has \nbeen issued, from detaining the alien un-\nder section 1231(a) of this title; \n(B) does not relieve the alien from \ncomplying with section 1231(a)(4) of this \ntitle and section 1253(g)\u202f[1] of this title; \nand \n(C) does not require the Attorney \nGeneral to defer removal of the alien. \n(9) Consolidation of questions for ju-\ndicial review.  Judicial review of all ques-\ntions of law and fact, including interpretation \nand application of constitutional and statu-\ntory provisions, arising from any action taken \nor proceeding brought to remove an alien from \nthe United States under this subchapter shall \nbe available only in judicial review of a final \norder under this section.

A court may review \na final order of removal only if\u2014 \n(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative \nremedies available to the alien as of right, and \n(2) another court has not decided the validity \nof the order, unless the reviewing court finds that \nthe petition presents grounds that could not have \nbeen presented in the prior judicial proceeding or \nthat the remedy provided by the prior proceeding \nwas inadequate or ineffective to test the validity \nof the order. \n* * * \n \n \n\n18a \nThe Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998 (FARRA), Pub.

Except as provided \nin paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an application \nfor withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) \nof the Act or under the Convention Against Tor-\nture shall be denied if the applicant falls within \nsection 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act or, for applications \nfor withholding of deportation adjudicated in pro-\nceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997, within \nsection 243(h)(2) of the Act as it appeared prior to \nthat date.  For purposes of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) \nof the Act, or section 243(h)(2)(B) of the Act as it \nappeared prior to April 1, 1997, an alien who has \nbeen convicted of a particularly serious crime \nshall be considered to constitute a danger to the \ncommunity.  If the evidence indicates the applica-\nbility of one or more of the grounds for denial of \nwithholding enumerated in the Act, the applicant \nshall have the burden of proving by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that such grounds do not ap-\nply.   \n* * *  \n \n\n31a \n(f) Removal to third country. \n(1) Nothing in this section or \u00a7 1208.17 shall \nprevent the Department of Homeland Security \nfrom removing an alien requesting protection to a \nthird country other than a country to which re-\nmoval is currently withheld or deferred. \n(2) If an alien requests withholding or deferral \nof removal to the applicable home country or an-\nother specific country, nothing in this section or \u00a7 \n1208.17 precludes the Department of Homeland \nSecurity from removing the alien to a third coun-\ntry prior to a determination or adjudication of the \nalien's initial request for withholding or deferral \nof removal if, after being notified of the identity of \nthe prospective third country of removal and pro-\nvided an opportunity to demonstrate that he or \nshe is more likely than not to be tortured in that \nthird country, the alien fails to establish that they \nare more likely than not to be tortured there.  \nHowever, such a removal shall be executed only if \nthe alien was: \n(i) Advised at the time of requesting with-\nholding or deferral of removal of the possibil-\nity of being removed to a third country prior to \na determination or adjudication of the same \nunder the conditions set forth in this para-\ngraph, and \n(ii) Provided, but did not accept, an oppor-\ntunity to withdraw the request for withhold-\ning or deferral of removal in order to prevent \nsuch removal and, instead, proceed to removal \npursuant to section 241(b) of the Act, as ap-\npropriate. \n\n32a \n8 C.F.R. 1208.17, Deferral of removal under the Con-\nvention Against Torture, provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Grant of deferral of removal.  An alien \nwho: has been ordered removed; has been found \nunder \u00a7 1208.16(c)(3) to be entitled to protection \nunder the Convention Against Torture; and is sub-\nject to the provisions for mandatory denial of with-\nholding of removal under \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2) or (d)(3), \nshall be granted deferral of removal to the country \nwhere he or she is more likely than not to be tor-\ntured. \n(b) Notice to alien. \n(1) After an immigration judge orders an \nalien described in paragraph (a) of this section \nremoved, the immigration judge shall inform \nthe alien that his or her removal to the coun-\ntry where he or she is more likely than not to \nbe tortured shall be deferred until such time \nas the deferral is terminated under this sec-\ntion.  The immigration judge shall inform the \nalien that deferral of removal: \n(i) Does not confer upon the alien any \nlawful or permanent immigration status \nin the United States; \n(ii) Will not necessarily result in the \nalien being released from the custody of \nthe Service if the alien is subject to such \ncustody; \n(iii) Is effective only until terminated; \nand \n(iv) Is subject to review and termina-\ntion if the immigration judge determines \n\n33a \nthat it is not likely that the alien would be \ntortured in the country to which removal \nhas been deferred, or if the alien requests \nthat deferral be terminated. \n(2) The immigration judge shall also inform \nthe alien that removal has been deferred only \nto the country in which it has been determined \nthat the alien is likely to be tortured, and that \nthe alien may be removed at any time to an-\nother country where he or she is not likely to \nbe tortured.   \n* * *  \n \n\n34a \n8 C.F.R. 1208.18, Implementation of the Convention \nAgainst Torture, establishes, in relevant part: \n* * *  \n(e) Judicial review of claims for protection \nfrom removal under Article 3 of the Convention \nAgainst Torture \n(1) Pursuant to the provisions of section 2242(d) \nof the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act \nof 1998, there shall be no judicial appeal or review of \nany action, decision, or claim raised under the Con-\nvention [Against Torture] or that section, except as \npart of the review of a final order of removal pursuant \nto section 242 of the [Immigration and Nationality] \nAct. \n \n \n\n35a \n8 C.F.R. 1208.31, Reasonable fear of persecution or \ntorture determinations involving noncitizens ordered \nremoved under section 238(b) of the Act and nonciti-\nzens whose removal is reinstated under section \n241(a)(5) of this Act, effective January 11, 2021 to De-\ncember 26, 2024, provides:  \n(a) Jurisdiction.  This section shall apply to any \nalien ordered removed under section 238(b) of the Act \nor whose deportation, exclusion, or removal order is \nreinstated under section 241(a)(5) of the Act who, in \nthe course of the administrative removal or reinstate-\nment process, expresses a fear of returning to the \ncountry of removal.  The Service has exclusive juris-\ndiction to make reasonable fear determinations, and \nEOIR has exclusive jurisdiction to review such deter-\nminations. \n(b) Initiation of reasonable fear determina-\ntion process.  Upon issuance of a Final Administra-\ntive Removal Order under \u00a7 238.1 of this chapter, or \nnotice under \u00a7 1241.8(b) of this chapter that an alien \nis subject to removal, an alien described in paragraph \n(a) of this section shall be referred to an asylum officer \nfor a reasonable fear determination.  In the absence of \nexceptional circumstances, this determination will be \nconducted within 10 days of the referral. \n(c) Interview and procedure.  The asylum of-\nficer shall conduct the interview in a non-adversarial \nmanner, separate and apart from the general public.  \n* * * The asylum officer shall create a written record \nof his or her determination, including a summary of \nthe material facts as stated by the applicant, any ad-\nditional facts relied on by the officers, and the officer's \ndetermination of whether, in light of such facts, the \nalien has established a reasonable fear of persecution \n\n36a \nor torture.  The alien shall be determined to have a \nreasonable fear of persecution or torture if the alien \nestablishes a reasonable possibility that he or she \nwould be persecuted on account of his or her race, re-\nligion, nationality, membership in a particular social \ngroup or political opinion, or a reasonable possibility \nthat he or she would be tortured in the country of re-\nmoval.  For purposes of the screening determination, \nthe bars to eligibility for withholding of removal under \nsection 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act shall not be considered. \n(d) Authority.  Asylum officers conducting \nscreening determinations under this section shall \nhave the authority described in \u00a7 1208.9(c). \n(e) Referral to Immigration Judge.  If an asy-\nlum officer determines that an alien described in this \nsection has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, \nthe officer shall so inform the alien and issue a Form \nI\u2013863, Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge, \nfor full consideration of the request for withholding of \nremoval only.  Such cases shall be adjudicated by the \nimmigration judge in accordance with the provisions \nof \u00a7 1208.16.  Appeal of the immigration judge's deci-\nsion shall lie to the Board of Immigration Appeals. \n(f) Removal of aliens with no reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture.  If the asylum officer de-\ntermines that the alien has not established a reason-\nable fear of persecution or torture, the asylum officer \nshall inform the alien in writing of the decision and \nshall inquire whether the alien wishes to have an im-\nmigration judge review the negative decision, using \nthe Record of Negative Reasonable Fear Finding and \nRequest for Review by Immigration Judge, on which \nthe alien must indicate whether he or she desires such \nreview.  If the alien refuses to make an indication, \n\n37a \nDHS shall consider such a response as a decision to \ndecline review. \n(g) Review by Immigration Judge.  The asy-\nlum officer's negative decision regarding reasonable \nfear shall be subject to review by an immigration \njudge upon the alien's request.  If the alien requests \nsuch review, the asylum officer shall serve him or her \nwith a Notice of Referral to the Immigration Judge.  \nThe record of determination, including copies of the \nNotice of Referral to the Immigration Judge, the asy-\nlum officer's notes, the summary of the material facts, \nand other materials upon which the determination \nwas based shall be provided to the immigration judge \nwith the negative determination.  In the absence of \nexceptional circumstances, such review shall be con-\nducted by the immigration judge within 10 days of the \nfiling of the Notice of Referral to the Immigration \nJudge with the immigration court.  Upon review of the \nasylum officer's negative reasonable fear determina-\ntion: \n(1) If the immigration judge concurs with the \nasylum officer's determination that the alien does \nnot have a reasonable fear of persecution or tor-\nture, the case shall be returned to DHS for re-\nmoval of the alien.  No appeal shall lie from the \nimmigration judge's decision. \n(2) If the immigration judge finds that the al-\nien has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture, \nthe alien may submit an Application for Asylum \nand for Withholding of Removal.  Such application \nshall be considered de novo in all respects by an \nimmigration judge regardless of any determina-\ntion made under this paragraph. \n\n38a \n(i) The immigration judge shall consider \nonly the alien's application for withholding of \nremoval under 8 CFR 1208.16 and shall deter-\nmine whether the alien's removal to the coun-\ntry of removal must be withheld or deferred. \n(ii) Appeal of the immigration judge's de-\ncision whether removal must be withheld or \ndeferred lies with the Board of Immigration \nAppeals.  If the alien or DHS appeals the im-\nmigration judge's decision, the Board shall re-\nview only the immigration judge's decision re-\ngarding the alien's eligibility for withholding \nor deferral of removal under 8 CFR 1208.16. \n \n \n\n39a \n8 C.F.R. 1238.1(f), Proceedings under section 238(b) of \nthe Act, establishes:  \n(f) Executing final removal order of deciding \nService officer\u2014 \n(1) Time of execution.  Upon the issuance of \na Final Administrative Removal Order, the Ser-\nvice shall issue a Warrant of Removal in accord-\nance with \u00a7 1241.2 of this chapter; such warrant \nshall be executed no sooner than 14 calendar days \nafter the date the Final Administrative Removal \nOrder is issued, unless the alien knowingly, vol-\nuntarily, and in writing waives the 14\u2013day period. \n(2) Country to which alien is to be re-\nmoved.  The deciding Service officer shall desig-\nnate the country of removal in the manner pre-\nscribed by section 241 of the Act. \n(3) Withholding of removal.  If the alien \nhas requested withholding of removal under \u00a7 \n1208.16 of this chapter, the deciding officer shall, \nupon issuance of a Final Administrative Removal \nOrder, immediately refer the alien's case to an \nasylum officer to conduct a reasonable fear deter-\nmination in accordance with \u00a7 1208.31 of this \nchapter.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be built upon the petitioner's arguments, but this is now tempered by a crucial meta-level insight: my current knowledge is entirely one-sided. While the evidence from the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari strongly favors the petitioner, I now explicitly recognize the need to acquire the respondent's counterarguments to form a robust predictive model.\n\nMy beliefs, therefore, remain stable in their content but are now qualified by this new awareness of uncertainty:\n\n1.  **Stable Belief in Entrenched Circuit Splits:** My belief, derived from the petitioner's cert petition, that two significant circuit splits exist remains unchanged.\n    *   **Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** The conflict persists between the Fourth Circuit's rigid jurisdictional view of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) and the modern, non-jurisdictional \"claims-processing\" approach favored by other circuits and recent Supreme Court precedent (*Santos-Zacaria*, *Wilkins*). The petitioner's citation of the Fifth and Ninth Circuits questioning the old rule remains a key piece of evidence.\n    *   **Question 2 (Reviewability of Withholding-Only Decisions):** The deep 5-2 split, with the Fourth and Second Circuits in the minority, remains a powerful indicator for Supreme Court intervention. The majority of circuits (Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth) permit review of BIA decisions in withholding-only proceedings, directly contradicting the Fourth Circuit's ruling in this case.\n\n2.  **Stable Understanding of Petitioner's Core Arguments:** The petitioner's framing of the issues remains central to my analysis.\n    *   The \"catch-22\" argument\u2014whereby exhausting administrative remedies for a CAT claim makes it impossible to meet the deadline for judicial review of the underlying removal order\u2014continues to appear as a potent argument against the Fourth Circuit's procedural framework. It suggests a potential frustration of congressional intent to provide for judicial review of CAT claims.\n    *   The textual argument based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(47)(B), defining a removal order as \"final\" only after the BIA's determination, remains a strong counterpoint to the Fourth Circuit's logic.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluation of the Government's Position:** The petitioner's claim that the government conceded the jurisdictional point in the lower court remains a critical signal. However, my new observation forces me to treat this with caution. While it is a strong indicator, it is still a claim made by the petitioner. I must verify this and understand the government's current stance before the Supreme Court. It is possible the government might change its position or argue that its concession below is not relevant to the cert-worthiness of the question.\n\n4.  **Newly Articulated Uncertainty:** My primary belief update is the formal acknowledgment that my perspective is incomplete. I have identified the \"Brief in Opposition\" as the next critical piece of evidence. My key uncertainties, which I expect that document to resolve, are:\n    *   **Will the government oppose certiorari?** Given its alleged concession below, it might waive its right to respond or even agree that review is warranted. Conversely, it might oppose cert by arguing the splits are not as clear-cut as the petitioner claims or that this case is a poor vehicle to resolve them.\n    *   **How will the government frame the merits?** I need to see the government's substantive defense of the Fourth Circuit's minority position on the reviewability of withholding-only orders. There may be a compelling textual or structural argument I have not yet considered.\n    *   **Will the government's position on the jurisdictional deadline remain consistent?** Its stance before the Supreme Court on whether \u00a7 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional is a crucial variable that will significantly influence the Court's decision to grant review and the likely outcome on the merits of that question.\n\nIn essence, my belief that the petitioner has a strong case for reversal is now a well-supported but provisional hypothesis. My confidence is high based on the available evidence, but it is constrained by the absence of any counterarguments from the respondent.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs have been substantially updated by the observation that the Supreme Court has granted certiorari and the case is now at the merits stage. The central uncertainty about whether the Court would hear the case is resolved, confirming my prior assessment that the identified circuit splits were significant. My knowledge is now deeply informed by the petitioner's merits brief, though it remains one-sided pending the respondent's arguments.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Cert-Worthiness and Shift to Merits:** The most critical update is the Court's decision to grant certiorari on November 4, 2024. This action validates my prior belief that the two legal questions\u2014the jurisdictional nature of the filing deadline and the reviewability of withholding-only decisions\u2014represent entrenched and important circuit splits requiring resolution. My task has now shifted from predicting a cert grant to predicting the final outcome on the merits. The absence of a \"Brief in Opposition\" in my search results, while not definitive, strengthens the possibility that the government did not strongly oppose certiorari, potentially aligning with the petitioner's claim of a concession in the lower court.\n\n2.  **Deepened Understanding of Petitioner's Argument on Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** The petitioner's merits brief provides a robust, two-pronged attack on the Fourth Circuit's position that the 30-day deadline in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.\n    *   **Reliance on Modern Precedent:** The argument is firmly anchored in the Court's recent, consistent jurisprudence requiring a \"clear statement\" to deem a rule jurisdictional. The brief's heavy reliance on *Santos-Zacaria v. Garland*, *Wilkins v. United States*, and the very recent *Harrow v. Department of Defense* (2024) shows a strategy of aligning with the Court's current textualist and procedural-rule framework.\n    *   **Neutralizing Contrary Precedent:** The petitioner directly confronts *Stone v. INS* (1995), the likely cornerstone of the government's counterargument. They argue that *Stone*'s jurisdictional language has been superseded by the modern framework established in cases from *Arbaugh* to *Santos-Zacaria*, effectively rendering it obsolete on this point. This preemptive move is a key signal of their legal strategy.\n\n3.  **Deepened Understanding of Petitioner's Argument on Question 2 (Finality and Reviewability):** The petitioner's argument that the 30-day clock starts only after the BIA's decision in the withholding-only proceeding is now fully fleshed out.\n    *   **Textualism and Ordinary Meaning:** The core of the argument is that an order cannot be \"final\" under \u00a7 1252(b)(1) until the agency has completed all proceedings related to it. They argue this aligns with the ordinary meaning of administrative finality, citing cases like *Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic*.\n    *   **Statutory Structure and Presumption of Review:** The brief invokes the strong presumption of judicial review, especially for CAT claims, which Congress has explicitly provided for. They argue the Fourth Circuit's interpretation creates a procedural trap that thwarts this congressional intent, citing *Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr*. This \"catch-22\" is framed as upending the \"orderly process of judicial review\" by forcing premature and piecemeal litigation.\n    *   **Distinguishing Unfavorable Precedent:** The petitioner proactively distinguishes two key cases. They argue that *Nasrallah v. Barr* (holding a CAT denial is not *itself* a final order of removal) does not answer the separate question of *when* the underlying removal order becomes final for judicial review. They also cabin *Johnson v. Guzman Chavez* to its specific statutory context of detention, arguing it does not control the timing of petitions for review.\n\n4.  **Refined and Focused Uncertainty:** My primary belief update is the shift in what I need to know. The grant of certiorari has eliminated the largest uncertainty. My predictive model is now highly detailed on the petitioner's side but still lacks the respondent's counter-narrative. The critical missing evidence is no longer the Brief in Opposition, but the **Respondent's Merits Brief**. My key uncertainties are now:\n    *   **How will the government defend the jurisdictional nature of the deadline?** Will they argue that *Stone v. INS* remains good law and is distinguishable from the *Santos-Zacaria* line of cases?\n    *   **How will the government define \"final order of removal\"?** Will they argue that *Nasrallah* and *Guzman Chavez* compel the Fourth Circuit's reading? How will they counter the petitioner's \"ordinary meaning\" and \"presumption of review\" arguments?\n    *   **Will the government maintain its alleged prior concession on the jurisdictional question?** Its stance in the merits brief will be a powerful signal for predicting the outcome of the first question presented.\n\nIn summary, my belief is that the petitioner has presented a powerful, well-reasoned case for reversal that is closely aligned with the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence on both jurisdictional rules and judicial review. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner has increased significantly, but it remains provisional until I can analyze the government's substantive defense of the Fourth Circuit's minority-view holdings.",

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENT \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-6a) \nis not published in the Federal Reporter but is available \nat 2024 WL 1826979.  The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (Pet. App. 7a-14a) and the immigra-\ntion judge (Pet. App. 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 26, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 31, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., a noncitizen may be subject \nto abbreviated removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \n1228 when the noncitizen has been convicted of an ag-\n\n2 \n \ngravated-felony offense.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b).1  When a \nnoncitizen is ordered removed under that process, he is \nineligible for any form of \u201crelief from removal that the \nAttorney General may grant in the Attorney General\u2019s \ndiscretion.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(5).  But a noncitizen who \nis statutorily barred from obtaining categorical relief \nfrom removal may still pursue \u201cwithholding-only relief \nto prevent [the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS)] from executing his removal to the particular \ncountry designated in his reinstated removal order.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 530 (2021); \nsee ibid. (recognizing that noncitizens who are barred \nfrom obtaining relief from removal under Section \n1231(a)(5) are still eligible for withholding of removal).  \nA withholding-only proceeding cannot result in a \ncomplete bar on a noncitizen\u2019s removal; instead, it may \nprevent him from being removed to a specific country in \nwhich he is likely to be persecuted or tortured.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 531-532.  Statutory with-\nholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \n1231(b)(3)(A), which prohibits removal to a country \nwhere the noncitizen\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threat-\nened\u201d because of \u201crace, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d  \nWithholding or deferral of removal is also available un-\nder regulations implementing the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment (Convention or CAT), adopted Dec. 10, \n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  The Convention \u201cprohibits \n \n1 This brief uses the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statu-\ntory term \u201calien.\u201d  See Barton v. Barr, 590 U.S. 222, 226 n.2 (2020) \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)). \n\n3 \n \nremoval of a noncitizen to a country where the nonciti-\nzen likely would be tortured.\u201d  Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 \nU.S. 573, 580 (2020).   \nb. When a noncitizen is subject to abbreviated re-\nmoval procedures under Section 1228(b), he generally \ndoes not appear before an immigration judge (IJ) or \nhave a right to an administrative appeal before the Board \nof Immigration Appeals (Board).  See 8 C.F.R. 238.1.  \nInstead, regulations provide that an immigration officer \nshall conduct written removal proceedings.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(a)-(c).  If the officer finds that the noncitizen is \neligible for removal under Section 1228(b), he issues a \n\u201cFinal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(d).   \nThe regulations, however, provide an exception for \nnoncitizens who seek withholding of removal.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(f\u200a).  When a noncitizen \u201chas requested withholding \nof removal,\u201d he will receive a reasonable-fear interview \nwith an asylum officer.  8 C.F.R. 238.1(f\u200a)(3); see 8 C.F.R. \n208.31(b).  If the asylum officer finds that the noncitizen \nhas no reasonable fear and an IJ sustains that finding, \nthe noncitizen will be deemed ineligible for withholding.  \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(f\u200a) and (g)(1).  But if the asylum officer \nor the IJ finds that the noncitizen has a reasonable fear, \nthen the noncitizen is entitled to full withholding-only \nproceedings before an IJ and an appeal to the Board.   \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(e) and (g)(2).   \nAn order denying withholding of removal \u201cmay not \nbe reviewed in [the] district courts, even via habeas cor-\npus,\u201d and must instead \u201cbe reviewed only in the courts \nof appeals\u201d under 8 U.S.C. 1252.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n580-581.  And under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), \u201c[t]he petition \nfor review must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d   \n\n4 \n \n2. Petitioner is a native and citizen of Jamaica.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.  He entered the United States in 1995 as a \ntourist and overstayed his visa.  Ibid.  In 2006, he was \nconvicted in federal court of multiple firearm and drug-\ntrafficking offenses and sentenced to a 25-year term of \nimprisonment.  Id. at 2a.  In January 2021, he was \ngranted compassionate release.  Ibid.  He was then \ntaken into custody by DHS and found removable under \nSection 1228(b)\u2019s abbreviated proceedings for nonciti-\nzens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.  \nIbid.  On January 26, 2021, an immigration officer is-\nsued a Final Administrative Removal Order.  Ibid.  Af-\nter petitioner expressed a fear of returning to Jamaica, \nhe was interviewed by an immigration officer who de-\ntermined that he had not established a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture in Jamaica.  Id. at 2a-3a.  But \nan IJ disagreed and placed petitioner in withholding-\nonly proceedings.  Ibid. \nDuring the withholding-only proceedings, petitioner \nconceded that, in light of his prior convictions, he was \neligible solely for deferral of removal under the CAT.  \nPet. App. 3a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ \ngranted petitioner\u2019s application for CAT deferral, id. at \n15a-27a, but DHS appealed that decision to the Board, \nid. at 3a.  On May 31, 2022, the Board issued a decision \nvacating the IJ\u2019s order granting CAT protection, and \nthe Board ordered petitioner removed to Jamaica.  Id. \nat 7a-14a.  Four days later, on June 3, 2022, petitioner \nfiled a petition for review in the court of appeals.  Id. at \n3a.   \n3. On April 26, 2024, the court of appeals issued an \nunpublished decision dismissing the petition for review \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 2a-6a.  The court \nfound that its decision was controlled by Martinez v. \n\n5 \n \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024).  Pet. \nApp. 4a-6a.   \nIn Martinez, the Fourth Circuit held that it lacked \njurisdiction to consider a petition for review of an order \ndenying withholding and CAT protection because the \npetition was filed more than 30 days after the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s prior order of removal was reinstated under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  86 F.4th at 571.  In reaching that hold-\ning, the court first found that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-\nday filing deadline is jurisdictional.  Id. at 566-567 & n.3.  \nIt then determined that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline \ncannot be triggered by a withholding order because it is \nnot a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d  Id. at 567.   \nMartinez assumed that a reinstatement order under \nSection 1231(a)(5) can qualify as a \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval\u201d but\u2014relying on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nBhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022)\u2014\nMartinez held that a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final as soon as the immigration officer makes his \ndecision, regardless of the pendency of any withholding-\nonly proceedings.  86 F.4th at 568-572.  Accordingly, \nMartinez found that a petition for review of a post- \nreinstatement order denying withholding or CAT pro-\ntection is untimely if it is filed more than 30 days after \nthe immigration officer\u2019s reinstatement determination \nbecomes final, even if the withholding-only proceedings \nare still ongoing at that time.  Id. at 571.    \nIn the decision below, the court of appeals found \nthat, under Martinez, Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a.  And the court \nfurther found that, under Martinez, the 30-day deadline \nbegan to run as soon as the immigration officer ordered \npetitioner removed under Section 1228(b), even though \n\n6 \n \nthe withholding-only proceedings were still pending.  \nIbid.  The court explained that it could \u201cdiscern no rea-\nson\u201d to \u201cdifferentiat[e] between\u201d reinstatement deter-\nminations under Section 1231(a)(5) and administrative \nremoval orders under Section 1228(b).  Id. at 5a.   \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 15-19) that the court of ap-\npeals erred in holding that the deadline in 8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review of an order of \nremoval is jurisdictional.  Petitioner is correct, and \nthere is division in the circuits regarding whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing deadline is jurisdictional.  But \nplenary review of that question would be premature be-\ncause this Court recently held that an analogous statu-\ntory filing deadline is not jurisdictional, and it empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms.\u201d  Harrow v. Depart-\nment of Def., 601 U.S. 480, 484 (2024) (citations omit-\nted).  Because Harrow was decided after the court of \nappeals\u2019 proceedings in this case had concluded, this \nCourt should grant certiorari, vacate the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remand for further proceedings in \nlight of Harrow\u2019s guidance regarding when a time limit \nmay be deemed jurisdictional.2   \nPetitioner also contends (Pet. 19-26) that the court of \nappeals erred in holding that a petition for review must \nbe filed within 30 days of the underlying administrative \nremoval determination, rather than within 30 days of \n \n2  Two other pending petitions for writs of certiorari seek review \nof the same or related questions, and the government is urging the \nsame disposition for those petitions in responses being filed at the \nsame time as this one.  See Martinez v. Garland, No. 23-7678 (filed \nMay 29, 2024); Miranda Sanchez v. Garland, No. 24-11 (filed July \n3, 2024).   \n\n7 \n \nthe issuance of the order denying CAT protection.  Pe-\ntitioner is correct, but again, review by this Court would \nbe premature.  The court of appeals reached its errone-\nous holding in reliance on its precedent regarding the \ntimeliness of petitions for review of orders denying \nwithholding of removal or CAT protection after previ-\nous orders of removal have been reinstated under  \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  That precedent was in turn based \non the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022).  But the Second Circuit \nordered supplemental briefing on the continued vitality \nof Bhaktibhai-Patel in a pair of cases that are still pend-\ning, suggesting that the issue is not yet ripe for the \nCourt\u2019s review.  Moreover, if the case is remanded in \nlight of Harrow and the court of appeals appropriately \ndetermines that the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1) is \nnonjurisdictional, the government intends to waive the \napplication of the 30-day deadline, which could prevent \npetitioner from being affected by the court of appeals\u2019 \nerroneous understanding of when a petition for review \nmust be filed.   \n1. The court of appeals erred in holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  That holding cannot be rec-\nonciled with Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 \n(2023), and Harrow, supra.  But because the court of \nappeals addressed the issue without the benefit of Har-\nrow, this Court should grant, vacate, and remand for \nfurther consideration in light of that decision.  \na.  Section 1252(b)(1) provides that a \u201cpetition for re-\nview must be filed not later than 30 days after the date \nof the final order of removal.\u201d  That text does not clearly \nindicate that the provision is intended to govern the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 subject-matter jurisdiction, but until \nrecently, the courts of appeals and the government \n\n8 \n \ncharacterized the time limit as jurisdictional based on \nthis Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386.3  \nIn Stone, the Court described a prior version of the \nINA\u2019s filing deadline, 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)(6) (Supp. V \n1993), as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d  514 U.S. at 405 (citation omit-\nted).  The Court reasoned that \u201c[\u200aj]udicial review provi-\nsions  * * *  are jurisdictional in nature,\u201d and this was \n\u201call the more true of statutory provisions specifying the \ntiming of review, for those time limits are, as we have \noften stated, \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted).   \nYet this Court\u2019s more recent decisions have made \nclear that Stone cannot be used to establish that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  In Santos-Zacaria, supra, \nthe Court rejected the government\u2019s reliance on Stone \nto support its argument that the INA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement, 8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1), is jurisdictional.  598 \nU.S. at 421.  The Court explained that, while Stone \u201cde-\nscribed portions of the [INA] that contained [Section] \n1252(d)(1)\u2019s predecessor as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Stone \nCourt had not \u201cattend[ed] to the distinction between \u2018ju-\nrisdictional\u2019 rules (as we understand them today) and \nnonjurisdictional but mandatory ones.\u201d  Ibid.  More-\nover, \u201cwhether the provisions were jurisdictional \u2018was \nnot central to the case.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  In \nrecognizing that Stone did not use the term \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction and did \nnot focus on the question of subject-matter jurisdiction \nat all, Santos-Zacaria severely undermined continued \n \n3 See, e.g., Mendias-Mendoza v. Sessions, 877 F.3d 223, 227 (5th \nCir. 2017); Chavarria-Reyes v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 275, 277 (7th Cir. \n2016); Hurtado v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir. 2016); Skurtu v. \nMukasey, 552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008). \n\n9 \n \nreliance on Stone to establish the jurisdictional status \nof the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1).   \nThe Court\u2019s more recent decision in Harrow makes \nit even more clear that Section 1252(b)(1) cannot be \ndeemed jurisdictional.  In Harrow, the Court held that \nthe \u201c60-day statutory deadline\u201d in 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(1) \nfor filing a petition for review of a veterans\u2019 benefits de-\ntermination in the Federal Circuit is not a \u201cjurisdic-\ntional requirement.\u201d  601 U.S. at 483 (citation omitted).  \nIn reaching that holding, the Court repeatedly empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional.\u201d  Id. at \n484 (citation omitted); see id. at 489 n.* (\u201ctime limits[,]  \n* * *  we repeat, are generally non-jurisdictional\u201d).   \nThe Court in Harrow further explained that, even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms,\u201d time bars should \nnot be deemed jurisdictional unless the \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory construction  * * *  plainly show that \nCongress imbued [the rule] with jurisdictional conse-\nquences.\u201d  601 U.S. at 484-485 (citations omitted; brack-\nets in original).  And the Court recognized that statu-\ntory time limits are generally not jurisdictional when \nthey appear alongside other procedural requirements \nthat are plainly nonjurisdictional.  Id. at 488 (finding \nthat the statutory deadline could not be deemed juris-\ndictional in part because it appeared as part of \u201ca bevy \nof procedural rules,\u201d concerning things like the manner \nof \u201cservice and other forms\u201d).   \nb. In light of those precedents, the court of appeals \nerred in holding that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Santos- \nZacaria and Harrow demonstrate that Stone was not \nusing the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to refer to subject- \nmatter jurisdiction when it stated that \u201cstatutory provi-\nsions specifying the timing of review\u201d are \u201c\u200a\u2018mandatory \n\n10 \n \nand jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Stone, 514 U.S. at 405 (citation \nomitted).  Further, while Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s text re-\nflects that the INA\u2019s deadline is mandatory, the provi-\nsion does not reference jurisdiction or otherwise \u201cset[] \nthe bounds of the \u2018court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nSantos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 (citation omitted).  And \nSection 1252(b)(1) appears as part of a list of procedural \nrules for petitions for review\u2014governing things like the \nmanner of \u201c[s]ervice\u201d and whether the record must be \n\u201ctypewritten,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2) and (3)\u2014that Con-\ngress is unlikely to have intended to imbue with juris-\ndictional significance.   \nAccordingly, after Santos-Zacaria, both the govern-\nment and several courts of appeals reconsidered their \nearlier position that Section 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional \nand recognized that the provision is more appropriately \ncharacterized as a mandatory claims-processing rule.  \nSee Alonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1047 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023); Inestroza-Tosta v. Garland, 105 \nF.4th 499, 509-512 (3d Cir. 2024).  The Fourth Circuit \nand the Seventh Circuit have declined to revisit their \nprecedent in light of Santos-Zacaria.  See Martinez v. \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566-567 (4th Cir. 2023), petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024); \nF.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th 620, 634 (7th Cir. 2024).  \nBut those decisions preceded Harrow\u2019s clear emphasis \nof the principle that time bars are generally nonjuris-\ndictional.   \nc. The court of appeals did not have the benefit of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Harrow when it decided Mar-\ntinez or when it applied the holding in Martinez to this \ncase.  This Court should therefore grant the petition for \n\n11 \n \na writ of certiorari, vacate the decision below, and re-\nmand for further proceedings in light of Harrow.   \n2. The court of appeals also erred in holding that the \npetition for review in this case was untimely under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1), even though it was filed within 30 days \nof the Board\u2019s order denying CAT protection.  Pet. App. \n4a-5a.  But again this Court\u2019s intervention would be \npremature because the Second Circuit appears to be re-\nconsidering the precedent on which the Fourth Circuit \nrelied, and the importance of the question will be dimin-\nished if the court of appeals holds on remand that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is not jurisdictional.  \na. Until 2022, the courts of appeals agreed that a re-\nmoval determination is not final for purposes of seeking \njudicial review until any withholding-only proceedings \nassociated with the reinstatement are completed.4  That \nunderstanding accords with the traditional rule that an \nadministrative decision is not final for purposes of judi-\ncial review until the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s de-\ncisionmaking process\u201d\u2014that is, not until all of the ad-\nministrative proceedings arising from the agency action \n(including withholding-only proceedings) have been \ncompleted.  Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997)).   \nPursuant to that understanding, the administrative \nremoval determination and the related withholding or \n \n4 See, e.g., Ponce-Osorio v. Johnson, 824 F.3d 502 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182 (10th Cir. \n2015); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2012).  Al-\nthough each of those decisions involved a reinstatement determina-\ntion under Section 1231(a)(5) rather than an administrative removal \norder under Section 1228(b), the court of appeals found that distinc-\ntion immaterial when it found that its Section 1231(a)(5) precedent \ncontrolled the outcome of this case.  Pet. App. 5a.   \n\n12 \n \nCAT order become final at the same time, thereby en-\nsuring that they may be re\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENT \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. 1a-6a) \nis not published in the Federal Reporter but is available \nat 2024 WL 1826979.  The decisions of the Board of Im-\nmigration Appeals (Pet. App. 7a-14a) and the immigra-\ntion judge (Pet. App. 15a-27a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 26, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 31, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., a noncitizen may be subject \nto abbreviated removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \n1228 when the noncitizen has been convicted of an ag-\n\n2 \n \ngravated-felony offense.  8 U.S.C. 1228(b).1  When a \nnoncitizen is ordered removed under that process, he is \nineligible for any form of \u201crelief from removal that the \nAttorney General may grant in the Attorney General\u2019s \ndiscretion.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1228(b)(5).  But a noncitizen who \nis statutorily barred from obtaining categorical relief \nfrom removal may still pursue \u201cwithholding-only relief \nto prevent [the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS)] from executing his removal to the particular \ncountry designated in his reinstated removal order.\u201d  \nJohnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523, 530 (2021); \nsee ibid. (recognizing that noncitizens who are barred \nfrom obtaining relief from removal under Section \n1231(a)(5) are still eligible for withholding of removal).  \nA withholding-only proceeding cannot result in a \ncomplete bar on a noncitizen\u2019s removal; instead, it may \nprevent him from being removed to a specific country in \nwhich he is likely to be persecuted or tortured.  See \nGuzman Chavez, 594 U.S. at 531-532.  Statutory with-\nholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \n1231(b)(3)(A), which prohibits removal to a country \nwhere the noncitizen\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threat-\nened\u201d because of \u201crace, religion, nationality, member-\nship in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d  \nWithholding or deferral of removal is also available un-\nder regulations implementing the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture \nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment (Convention or CAT), adopted Dec. 10, \n1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 20, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 114.  The Convention \u201cprohibits \n \n1 This brief uses the term \u201cnoncitizen\u201d as equivalent to the statu-\ntory term \u201calien.\u201d  See Barton v. Barr, 590 U.S. 222, 226 n.2 (2020) \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3)). \n\n3 \n \nremoval of a noncitizen to a country where the nonciti-\nzen likely would be tortured.\u201d  Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 \nU.S. 573, 580 (2020).   \nb. When a noncitizen is subject to abbreviated re-\nmoval procedures under Section 1228(b), he generally \ndoes not appear before an immigration judge (IJ) or \nhave a right to an administrative appeal before the Board \nof Immigration Appeals (Board).  See 8 C.F.R. 238.1.  \nInstead, regulations provide that an immigration officer \nshall conduct written removal proceedings.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(a)-(c).  If the officer finds that the noncitizen is \neligible for removal under Section 1228(b), he issues a \n\u201cFinal Administrative Removal Order.\u201d  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(d).   \nThe regulations, however, provide an exception for \nnoncitizens who seek withholding of removal.  8 C.F.R. \n238.1(f\u200a).  When a noncitizen \u201chas requested withholding \nof removal,\u201d he will receive a reasonable-fear interview \nwith an asylum officer.  8 C.F.R. 238.1(f\u200a)(3); see 8 C.F.R. \n208.31(b).  If the asylum officer finds that the noncitizen \nhas no reasonable fear and an IJ sustains that finding, \nthe noncitizen will be deemed ineligible for withholding.  \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(f\u200a) and (g)(1).  But if the asylum officer \nor the IJ finds that the noncitizen has a reasonable fear, \nthen the noncitizen is entitled to full withholding-only \nproceedings before an IJ and an appeal to the Board.   \n8 C.F.R. 208.31(e) and (g)(2).   \nAn order denying withholding of removal \u201cmay not \nbe reviewed in [the] district courts, even via habeas cor-\npus,\u201d and must instead \u201cbe reviewed only in the courts \nof appeals\u201d under 8 U.S.C. 1252.  Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at \n580-581.  And under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1), \u201c[t]he petition \nfor review must be filed not later than 30 days after the \ndate of the final order of removal.\u201d   \n\n4 \n \n2. Petitioner is a native and citizen of Jamaica.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.  He entered the United States in 1995 as a \ntourist and overstayed his visa.  Ibid.  In 2006, he was \nconvicted in federal court of multiple firearm and drug-\ntrafficking offenses and sentenced to a 25-year term of \nimprisonment.  Id. at 2a.  In January 2021, he was \ngranted compassionate release.  Ibid.  He was then \ntaken into custody by DHS and found removable under \nSection 1228(b)\u2019s abbreviated proceedings for nonciti-\nzens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.  \nIbid.  On January 26, 2021, an immigration officer is-\nsued a Final Administrative Removal Order.  Ibid.  Af-\nter petitioner expressed a fear of returning to Jamaica, \nhe was interviewed by an immigration officer who de-\ntermined that he had not established a reasonable fear \nof persecution or torture in Jamaica.  Id. at 2a-3a.  But \nan IJ disagreed and placed petitioner in withholding-\nonly proceedings.  Ibid. \nDuring the withholding-only proceedings, petitioner \nconceded that, in light of his prior convictions, he was \neligible solely for deferral of removal under the CAT.  \nPet. App. 3a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ \ngranted petitioner\u2019s application for CAT deferral, id. at \n15a-27a, but DHS appealed that decision to the Board, \nid. at 3a.  On May 31, 2022, the Board issued a decision \nvacating the IJ\u2019s order granting CAT protection, and \nthe Board ordered petitioner removed to Jamaica.  Id. \nat 7a-14a.  Four days later, on June 3, 2022, petitioner \nfiled a petition for review in the court of appeals.  Id. at \n3a.   \n3. On April 26, 2024, the court of appeals issued an \nunpublished decision dismissing the petition for review \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 2a-6a.  The court \nfound that its decision was controlled by Martinez v. \n\n5 \n \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566 (4th Cir. 2023), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024).  Pet. \nApp. 4a-6a.   \nIn Martinez, the Fourth Circuit held that it lacked \njurisdiction to consider a petition for review of an order \ndenying withholding and CAT protection because the \npetition was filed more than 30 days after the nonciti-\nzen\u2019s prior order of removal was reinstated under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  86 F.4th at 571.  In reaching that hold-\ning, the court first found that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-\nday filing deadline is jurisdictional.  Id. at 566-567 & n.3.  \nIt then determined that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s deadline \ncannot be triggered by a withholding order because it is \nnot a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d  Id. at 567.   \nMartinez assumed that a reinstatement order under \nSection 1231(a)(5) can qualify as a \u201cfinal order of re-\nmoval\u201d but\u2014relying on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nBhaktibhai-Patel v. Garland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022)\u2014\nMartinez held that a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final as soon as the immigration officer makes his \ndecision, regardless of the pendency of any withholding-\nonly proceedings.  86 F.4th at 568-572.  Accordingly, \nMartinez found that a petition for review of a post- \nreinstatement order denying withholding or CAT pro-\ntection is untimely if it is filed more than 30 days after \nthe immigration officer\u2019s reinstatement determination \nbecomes final, even if the withholding-only proceedings \nare still ongoing at that time.  Id. at 571.    \nIn the decision below, the court of appeals found \nthat, under Martinez, Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a.  And the court \nfurther found that, under Martinez, the 30-day deadline \nbegan to run as soon as the immigration officer ordered \npetitioner removed under Section 1228(b), even though \n\n6 \n \nthe withholding-only proceedings were still pending.  \nIbid.  The court explained that it could \u201cdiscern no rea-\nson\u201d to \u201cdifferentiat[e] between\u201d reinstatement deter-\nminations under Section 1231(a)(5) and administrative \nremoval orders under Section 1228(b).  Id. at 5a.   \nDISCUSSION \nPetitioner contends (Pet. 15-19) that the court of ap-\npeals erred in holding that the deadline in 8 U.S.C. \n1252(b)(1) for filing a petition for review of an order of \nremoval is jurisdictional.  Petitioner is correct, and \nthere is division in the circuits regarding whether Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1)\u2019s filing deadline is jurisdictional.  But \nplenary review of that question would be premature be-\ncause this Court recently held that an analogous statu-\ntory filing deadline is not jurisdictional, and it empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional,\u201d even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms.\u201d  Harrow v. Depart-\nment of Def., 601 U.S. 480, 484 (2024) (citations omit-\nted).  Because Harrow was decided after the court of \nappeals\u2019 proceedings in this case had concluded, this \nCourt should grant certiorari, vacate the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision, and remand for further proceedings in \nlight of Harrow\u2019s guidance regarding when a time limit \nmay be deemed jurisdictional.2   \nPetitioner also contends (Pet. 19-26) that the court of \nappeals erred in holding that a petition for review must \nbe filed within 30 days of the underlying administrative \nremoval determination, rather than within 30 days of \n \n2  Two other pending petitions for writs of certiorari seek review \nof the same or related questions, and the government is urging the \nsame disposition for those petitions in responses being filed at the \nsame time as this one.  See Martinez v. Garland, No. 23-7678 (filed \nMay 29, 2024); Miranda Sanchez v. Garland, No. 24-11 (filed July \n3, 2024).   \n\n7 \n \nthe issuance of the order denying CAT protection.  Pe-\ntitioner is correct, but again, review by this Court would \nbe premature.  The court of appeals reached its errone-\nous holding in reliance on its precedent regarding the \ntimeliness of petitions for review of orders denying \nwithholding of removal or CAT protection after previ-\nous orders of removal have been reinstated under  \n8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(5).  That precedent was in turn based \non the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Bhaktibhai-Patel v. \nGarland, 32 F.4th 180 (2022).  But the Second Circuit \nordered supplemental briefing on the continued vitality \nof Bhaktibhai-Patel in a pair of cases that are still pend-\ning, suggesting that the issue is not yet ripe for the \nCourt\u2019s review.  Moreover, if the case is remanded in \nlight of Harrow and the court of appeals appropriately \ndetermines that the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1) is \nnonjurisdictional, the government intends to waive the \napplication of the 30-day deadline, which could prevent \npetitioner from being affected by the court of appeals\u2019 \nerroneous understanding of when a petition for review \nmust be filed.   \n1. The court of appeals erred in holding that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  That holding cannot be rec-\nonciled with Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411 \n(2023), and Harrow, supra.  But because the court of \nappeals addressed the issue without the benefit of Har-\nrow, this Court should grant, vacate, and remand for \nfurther consideration in light of that decision.  \na.  Section 1252(b)(1) provides that a \u201cpetition for re-\nview must be filed not later than 30 days after the date \nof the final order of removal.\u201d  That text does not clearly \nindicate that the provision is intended to govern the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 subject-matter jurisdiction, but until \nrecently, the courts of appeals and the government \n\n8 \n \ncharacterized the time limit as jurisdictional based on \nthis Court\u2019s 1995 decision in Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386.3  \nIn Stone, the Court described a prior version of the \nINA\u2019s filing deadline, 8 U.S.C. 1105a(a)(6) (Supp. V \n1993), as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d  514 U.S. at 405 (citation omit-\nted).  The Court reasoned that \u201c[\u200aj]udicial review provi-\nsions  * * *  are jurisdictional in nature,\u201d and this was \n\u201call the more true of statutory provisions specifying the \ntiming of review, for those time limits are, as we have \noften stated, \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted).   \nYet this Court\u2019s more recent decisions have made \nclear that Stone cannot be used to establish that Section \n1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional.  In Santos-Zacaria, supra, \nthe Court rejected the government\u2019s reliance on Stone \nto support its argument that the INA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement, 8 U.S.C. 1252(d)(1), is jurisdictional.  598 \nU.S. at 421.  The Court explained that, while Stone \u201cde-\nscribed portions of the [INA] that contained [Section] \n1252(d)(1)\u2019s predecessor as \u2018jurisdictional,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Stone \nCourt had not \u201cattend[ed] to the distinction between \u2018ju-\nrisdictional\u2019 rules (as we understand them today) and \nnonjurisdictional but mandatory ones.\u201d  Ibid.  More-\nover, \u201cwhether the provisions were jurisdictional \u2018was \nnot central to the case.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  In \nrecognizing that Stone did not use the term \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction and did \nnot focus on the question of subject-matter jurisdiction \nat all, Santos-Zacaria severely undermined continued \n \n3 See, e.g., Mendias-Mendoza v. Sessions, 877 F.3d 223, 227 (5th \nCir. 2017); Chavarria-Reyes v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 275, 277 (7th Cir. \n2016); Hurtado v. Lynch, 810 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir. 2016); Skurtu v. \nMukasey, 552 F.3d 651, 658 (8th Cir. 2008). \n\n9 \n \nreliance on Stone to establish the jurisdictional status \nof the deadline in Section 1252(b)(1).   \nThe Court\u2019s more recent decision in Harrow makes \nit even more clear that Section 1252(b)(1) cannot be \ndeemed jurisdictional.  In Harrow, the Court held that \nthe \u201c60-day statutory deadline\u201d in 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(1) \nfor filing a petition for review of a veterans\u2019 benefits de-\ntermination in the Federal Circuit is not a \u201cjurisdic-\ntional requirement.\u201d  601 U.S. at 483 (citation omitted).  \nIn reaching that holding, the Court repeatedly empha-\nsized that \u201cmost time bars are nonjurisdictional.\u201d  Id. at \n484 (citation omitted); see id. at 489 n.* (\u201ctime limits[,]  \n* * *  we repeat, are generally non-jurisdictional\u201d).   \nThe Court in Harrow further explained that, even \nwhen \u201cframed in mandatory terms,\u201d time bars should \nnot be deemed jurisdictional unless the \u201ctraditional \ntools of statutory construction  * * *  plainly show that \nCongress imbued [the rule] with jurisdictional conse-\nquences.\u201d  601 U.S. at 484-485 (citations omitted; brack-\nets in original).  And the Court recognized that statu-\ntory time limits are generally not jurisdictional when \nthey appear alongside other procedural requirements \nthat are plainly nonjurisdictional.  Id. at 488 (finding \nthat the statutory deadline could not be deemed juris-\ndictional in part because it appeared as part of \u201ca bevy \nof procedural rules,\u201d concerning things like the manner \nof \u201cservice and other forms\u201d).   \nb. In light of those precedents, the court of appeals \nerred in holding that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Santos- \nZacaria and Harrow demonstrate that Stone was not \nusing the term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d to refer to subject- \nmatter jurisdiction when it stated that \u201cstatutory provi-\nsions specifying the timing of review\u201d are \u201c\u200a\u2018mandatory \n\n10 \n \nand jurisdictional.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Stone, 514 U.S. at 405 (citation \nomitted).  Further, while Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s text re-\nflects that the INA\u2019s deadline is mandatory, the provi-\nsion does not reference jurisdiction or otherwise \u201cset[] \nthe bounds of the \u2018court\u2019s adjudicatory authority.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nSantos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 416 (citation omitted).  And \nSection 1252(b)(1) appears as part of a list of procedural \nrules for petitions for review\u2014governing things like the \nmanner of \u201c[s]ervice\u201d and whether the record must be \n\u201ctypewritten,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(2) and (3)\u2014that Con-\ngress is unlikely to have intended to imbue with juris-\ndictional significance.   \nAccordingly, after Santos-Zacaria, both the govern-\nment and several courts of appeals reconsidered their \nearlier position that Section 1252(b)(1) is jurisdictional \nand recognized that the provision is more appropriately \ncharacterized as a mandatory claims-processing rule.  \nSee Alonso-Juarez v. Garland, 80 F.4th 1039, 1047 (9th \nCir. 2023); Argueta-Hernandez v. Garland, 87 F.4th \n698, 705 (5th Cir. 2023); Inestroza-Tosta v. Garland, 105 \nF.4th 499, 509-512 (3d Cir. 2024).  The Fourth Circuit \nand the Seventh Circuit have declined to revisit their \nprecedent in light of Santos-Zacaria.  See Martinez v. \nGarland, 86 F.4th 561, 566-567 (4th Cir. 2023), petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 23-7678 (filed May 29, 2024); \nF.J.A.P. v. Garland, 94 F.4th 620, 634 (7th Cir. 2024).  \nBut those decisions preceded Harrow\u2019s clear emphasis \nof the principle that time bars are generally nonjuris-\ndictional.   \nc. The court of appeals did not have the benefit of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Harrow when it decided Mar-\ntinez or when it applied the holding in Martinez to this \ncase.  This Court should therefore grant the petition for \n\n11 \n \na writ of certiorari, vacate the decision below, and re-\nmand for further proceedings in light of Harrow.   \n2. The court of appeals also erred in holding that the \npetition for review in this case was untimely under Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1), even though it was filed within 30 days \nof the Board\u2019s order denying CAT protection.  Pet. App. \n4a-5a.  But again this Court\u2019s intervention would be \npremature because the Second Circuit appears to be re-\nconsidering the precedent on which the Fourth Circuit \nrelied, and the importance of the question will be dimin-\nished if the court of appeals holds on remand that Sec-\ntion 1252(b)(1) is not jurisdictional.  \na. Until 2022, the courts of appeals agreed that a re-\nmoval determination is not final for purposes of seeking \njudicial review until any withholding-only proceedings \nassociated with the reinstatement are completed.4  That \nunderstanding accords with the traditional rule that an \nadministrative decision is not final for purposes of judi-\ncial review until the \u201cconsummation of the agency\u2019s de-\ncisionmaking process\u201d\u2014that is, not until all of the ad-\nministrative proceedings arising from the agency action \n(including withholding-only proceedings) have been \ncompleted.  Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182, 1185 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997)).   \nPursuant to that understanding, the administrative \nremoval determination and the related withholding or \n \n4 See, e.g., Ponce-Osorio v. Johnson, 824 F.3d 502 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(per curiam); Luna-Garcia v. Holder, 777 F.3d 1182 (10th Cir. \n2015); Ortiz-Alfaro v. Holder, 694 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2012).  Al-\nthough each of those decisions involved a reinstatement determina-\ntion under Section 1231(a)(5) rather than an administrative removal \norder under Section 1228(b), the court of appeals found that distinc-\ntion immaterial when it found that its Section 1231(a)(5) precedent \ncontrolled the outcome of this case.  Pet. App. 5a.   \n\n12 \n \nCAT order become final at the same time, thereby en-\nsuring that they may be reviewed through a single peti-\ntion for review filed within 30 days of the \u201cfinal order of \nremoval.\u201d  8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(1).  Congress obviously in-\ntended that synchronicity because 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9) \nprovides that judicial review of \u201call questions of law and \nfact  * * *  arising from any action taken or proceeding \nbrought to remove an alien  * * *  shall be available only \nin judicial review of a final order under this section.\u201d  \nSee Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 U.S. 573, 583 (2020) (recog-\nnizing that, under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(9), \u201ca CAT order \nmay be reviewed together with the final order of re-\nmoval\u201d).  Because of Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day filing \ndeadline, it would not be possible to consolidate judicial \nreview of all removal-related issues into a single pro-\nceeding, as Section 1252(b)(9) contemplates, unless the \nremoval order and any related administrative orders \nwere understood as becoming final at the same time.   \nNonetheless, in 2022 the Second Circuit broke from \nthe previous consensus that Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s 30-day \nclock begins to run after withholding-only proceedings \nare complete.  See Bhaktibhai-Patel, supra.  In Bhak-\ntibhai-Patel, the court of appeals held that an immigra-\ntion officer\u2019s decision to reinstate a prior removal order \nunder Section 1231(a)(5) becomes \u201cfinal\u201d under Section \n1252 (and the 30-day clock starts to run) as soon as the \ndecision is made, even if withholding-only proceedings \nare still pending.  The Second Circuit believed that po-\nsition followed from this Court\u2019s decisions in Nasrallah, \nsupra, and Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U.S. 523 \n(2021).  Bhaktibhai-Patel, 32 F.4th at 193-194.  The Sec-\nond Circuit observed that, under Nasrallah, an order \nregarding withholding is distinct from a \u201cremoval or-\nder.\u201d  Id. at 191.  And it further observed that, in Guz-\n\n13 \n \nman Chavez, the Court held that a reinstated removal \norder is final for purposes of detention pending removal \nunder 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(1)(B), even if the related with-\nholding-only proceedings are still pending.  Bhaktibhai-\nPatel, 32 F.4th at 193.   \nFrom those premises, Bhaktibhai-Patel concluded \nthat a reinstated removal order must also be final for \npurposes of judicial review under Section 1252, even if \nwithholding-only proceedings are still pending.  32 \nF.4th at 193-195.  And because an order denying with-\nholding or CAT protection \u201cis not itself a final order of \nremoval,\u201d the court found that such an order cannot \ntrigger another 30-day window for filing a petition for \nreview under Section 1252(a)(1).  Id. at 191 (citation \nomitted).  Bhaktibhai-Patel therefore concluded that \njudicial review of an order denying withholding is pos-\nsible only if a petition for review is filed within 30 days \nof the underlying decision to reinstate a previous re-\nmoval order.  Id. at 191-192.   \nb. Relying on Bhaktibhai-Patel, the Fourth Circuit \nheld in Martinez, supra, that a petition for review of a \npost-reinstatement withholding order is timely only if it \nis filed within 30 days of the reinstatement determina-\ntion.  And, relying on Martinez, the decision below held \nthat a petition for review of an order denying CAT pro-\ntection is untimely when it is filed more than 30 days \nafter the underlying administrative removal determina-\ntion under Section 1228(b).  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  That was \nerror.   \nWhile the court of appeals was correct that the same \nprinciples apply in the context of administrative re-\nmoval orders under Section 1228(b) and reinstatement \ndeterminations under Section 1231(a)(5), Pet. App. 5a, \nthose principles establish that neither an administrative \n\n14 \n \nremoval order nor a reinstatement determination be-\ncomes final until after the conclusion of any associated \nCAT or withholding proceedings.  See pp. 11-12, supra.  \nAnd as the Fifth Circuit recently recognized when it re-\nconsidered a decision that had adopted Bhaktibhai- \nPatel\u2019s reasoning, neither Nasrallah nor Guzman \nChavez upsets the well-established understanding that \na petition for review of an order denying CAT protec-\ntion is timely so long as it is filed within 30 days of the \ndate on which the CAT order was issued.  See Argueta-\nHernandez, 87 F.4th at 706.   \nNasrallah involved the applicability of a judicial- \nreview bar to findings of fact within an order denying \nCAT protection; it did not change the timing or availa-\nbility of judicial review of CAT orders.  590 U.S. at 587.  \nTo the contrary, the Court recognized that Congress \nhas \u201cprovide[d] for direct review of CAT orders in the \ncourts of appeals.\u201d  Id. at 585 (citing 8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(4) \nand (b)(9)).  And the Nasrallah Court expressly stated \nthat its \u201cdecision d[id] not affect the authority of the \ncourts of appeals to review CAT orders.\u201d  Ibid.  That \nassurance would be eviscerated if the 30-day deadline \nfor seeking judicial review starts to run before any at-\ntendant CAT proceedings have concluded.   \nFurther, while Guzman Chavez held that the pen-\ndency of withholding-only proceedings does not render \na removal order nonfinal for purposes of triggering ad-\nministrative detention under 8 U.S.C. 1231, the Court \nexplained that it was not expressing any \u201cview on \nwhether the lower courts are correct in\u201d holding that a \nremoval order is not final for purposes of Section 1252 \nuntil withholding-only proceedings are complete.  594 \nU.S. at 535 n.6.  The Court observed that Section 1252 \n\u201cuses different language than [Section] 1231 and relates \n\n15 \n \nto judicial review of removal orders rather than deten-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \nAs the Fifth Circuit recently observed, embracing \nthe reasoning of Bhaktibhai-Patel could also \u201chave dis-\nastrous consequences on the immigration and judicial \nsystems.\u201d  Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 706.  If a \nnoncitizen could obtain review of a withholding or CAT \norder only by filing a petition for review within 30 days \nof the underlying removal determination, then the \nnoncitizen would have an incentive to file a prophylactic \npetition for review, in the hopes of convincing the court \nof appeals to hold his petition in abeyance until the with-\nholding or CAT proceedings have concluded so that, if \nthe agency ultimately denies the requested relief, he \nmay then challenge any asserted errors in that denial \norder.  See id. at 706 & n.5.  And given that most with-\nholding and CAT proceedings take months or years to \ncomplete, the courts of appeals would be forced to \nchoose between permitting \u201cnumerous\u201d burdensome, \nprophylactic petitions, ibid., or effectively foreclosing \njudicial review of withholding and CAT orders in the \ncontext of administrative removal orders under Section \n1228(b) and reinstatement determinations under Sec-\ntion 1231(a)(5).  But see Nasrallah, 590 U.S. at 583-584 \n(emphasizing that CAT orders are judicially reviewa-\nble).   \nc. Although the court of appeals\u2019 decision regarding \nthe timeliness of the petition for review was erroneous, \nthis Court\u2019s intervention would be premature.  Most of \nthe courts of appeals to have considered the question \nhave declined to adopt Bhaktibhai-Patel\u2019s reasoning.5  \n \n5 See Inestroza-Tosta, 105 F.4th at 514 & n.12; F.J.A.P., 94 F.4th \nat 631-638; Argueta-Hernandez, 87 F.4th at 705-706; Alonso-Juarez, \n80 F.4th at 1047-1054; Kolov v. Garland, 78 F.4th 911, 916-919 (6th \n\n16 \n \nAnd the Second Circuit itself has issued a briefing order \nindicating that it may be inclined to reconsider its deci-\nsion.  See 22-6024 Doc. 25.1, Castejon-Paz v. Garland \n(July 12, 2023); 22-6349 Doc. 23.1 Cerrato-Barahona v. \nGarland (July 12, 2023).  The court held oral argument \nin the cases in which the briefing order was issued in \nApril, but the cases have not yet been decided.  If the \nSecond Circuit retreats from its erroneous position, the \nFourth Circuit could well do the same, obviating the \nneed for this Court\u2019s intervention. \nMoreover, the importance of the question would be \ndiminished if the Court remands the jurisdictional ques-\ntion for reconsideration in light of Harrow, and the \ncourt of appeals appropriately deems Section 1252(b)(1)\u2019s \nfiling deadline to be nonjurisdictional.  In that event, the \ngovernment intends to waive any argument that the pe-\ntition for review was untimely\u2014both in this case and in \nother cases in which a similarly situated noncitizen has \nfiled a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance \nof a CAT or withholding order.  The government\u2019s \nwaiver would permit the same filing deadline to apply \nregardless of the circuit in which the petition for review \nwas filed.   \n \nCir. 2023); Arostegui-Maldonado v.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the merits of this case remain stable, as the recent observation was an internal reflection on information-gathering strategy rather than new substantive evidence. The observation confirmed that I have successfully analyzed the petitioner's arguments but still lack the respondent's counter-arguments, reinforcing my current state of knowledge without altering it.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Cert-Worthiness and Shift to Merits:** My belief that the Supreme Court's grant of certiorari on November 4, 2024, validated the significance of the circuit splits remains unchanged. My focus is firmly on predicting the merits outcome. The lack of a \"Brief in Opposition\" in my search history continues to suggest the government may not have strongly contested the cert grant.\n\n2.  **Stable, Deepened Understanding of Petitioner's Argument on Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** My understanding of the petitioner's strong argument against the jurisdictional nature of the 30-day deadline in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) is unchanged. This argument is built on the Court's clear-statement rule for jurisdictional statutes, as articulated in *Santos-Zacaria v. Garland*, *Wilkins v. United States*, and *Harrow v. Department of Defense*. The petitioner's strategy of preemptively distinguishing and arguing the obsolescence of *Stone v. INS* (1995) in light of this modern precedent remains a key strength of their case.\n\n3.  **Stable, Deepened Understanding of Petitioner's Argument on Question 2 (Finality and Reviewability):** My assessment of the petitioner's argument for the reviewability of the withholding-only decision is also stable. The argument rests on the ordinary meaning of administrative finality, the strong presumption of judicial review for CAT claims (*Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr*), and the contention that the Fourth Circuit's rule creates an unworkable \"catch-22.\" The petitioner's proactive efforts to distinguish *Nasrallah v. Barr* and *Johnson v. Guzman Chavez* remain central to their position.\n\n4.  **Unchanged and Reaffirmed Uncertainty:** The latest observation served to confirm the primary gap in my knowledge. My predictive model is detailed on the petitioner's side, but the respondent's position is still a black box. The observation correctly identified that the next critical piece of evidence is the **Respondent's Merits Brief**. My key uncertainties are therefore unchanged and reaffirmed:\n    *   How will the government defend the jurisdictional reading of the deadline post-*Santos-Zacaria*? Will they attempt to revive *Stone v. INS* or argue the modern precedents are inapplicable?\n    *   How will the government define \"final order of removal\" to counter the petitioner's textual and structural arguments? How will they leverage *Nasrallah* and *Guzman Chavez*?\n    *   Will the government's merits brief reflect the alleged prior concession on the jurisdictional question, or will they mount a full defense?\n\nIn summary, my belief that the petitioner has presented a compelling case for reversal, closely aligned with current Supreme Court jurisprudence, remains firm. The recent observation did not introduce new evidence to challenge this belief. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner is therefore stable, but it remains provisional and awaits the crucial counter-arguments in the Respondent's Merits Brief.",

Confirming this strategy provides significant value for future predictions, resulting in a moderately high Design EIG.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous state of high but provisional confidence in the petitioner's success has been dramatically altered and solidified by the Respondent's Brief. The \"black box\" of the government's position is now fully illuminated, revealing not a counter-argument, but a complete concession on both legal questions presented. This transforms the nature of the case from an adversarial dispute to a question of the appropriate remedy for the Fourth Circuit's acknowledged errors.\n\n1.  **Resolved Uncertainty on Question 1 (Jurisdictional Deadline):** My primary uncertainty is resolved. The government, represented by the Solicitor General, explicitly agrees with the petitioner that the 30-day deadline in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) is a non-jurisdictional, mandatory claims-processing rule.\n    *   **New Evidence:** The government's brief states, \"Petitioner is correct\" that the deadline is not jurisdictional.\n    *   **Legal Rationale:** The government concedes that the Supreme Court's recent decisions in *Harrow v. Department of Defense* (2024) and *Santos-Zacaria v. Garland* (2023) have rendered its previous position, based on *Stone v. INS* (1995), untenable. They acknowledge that *Harrow*, in particular, emphasized that \"most time bars are nonjurisdictional.\"\n    *   **Impact:** My belief that the petitioner's argument on this point was strong is now confirmed by their adversary. The legal question is no longer in dispute between the parties. My confidence in a reversal on this ground is now extremely high.\n\n2.  **Resolved Uncertainty on Question 2 (Finality and Reviewability):** My second major uncertainty is also resolved. The government agrees with the petitioner that the Fourth Circuit erred and that a petition for review is timely if filed within 30 days of the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision in a withholding-only proceeding.\n    *   **New Evidence:** The government's brief states, \"The court of appeals also erred in holding that the petition for review in this case was untimely...\"\n    *   **Legal Rationale:** The government agrees that under the traditional rule of administrative finality (*Bennett v. Spear*), the removal process is not \"consummated\" until the withholding-only proceedings are complete. They effectively side with the majority of circuits against the outlier position of the Second Circuit (*Bhaktibhai-Patel*) and the Fourth Circuit (*Martinez*).\n    *   **Impact:** This concession validates my assessment of the petitioner's \"catch-22\" argument. More importantly, the government provides a crucial piece of new information: **it \"intends to waive the application of the 30-day deadline\" if the case is remanded.** This provides an independent, case-dispositive reason for the petitioner to prevail, further cementing the likelihood of a favorable outcome.\n\n3.  **Shift in Predictive Focus from Merits to Disposition:** The central predictive question is no longer *whether* the petitioner will win, but *how* the Supreme Court will dispose of the case.\n    *   **Previous Belief:** I was focused on how the justices would weigh the competing legal arguments on the merits.\n    *   **Updated Belief:** With the parties in complete agreement, the focus shifts to the procedural outcome. The government's brief requested a \"GVR\" (Grant, Vacate, and Remand) so the Fourth Circuit could reconsider its decision in light of *Harrow*. However, the Supreme Court's subsequent decision to grant certiorari (as noted in my prior beliefs) *after* seeing the government's concession suggests the Court may wish to do more than simply remand. It may be inclined to issue a summary reversal or a short per curiam opinion to definitively resolve the circuit splits, providing clear guidance to all lower courts rather than just the Fourth Circuit.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent's Brief has provided dispositive evidence. The government's full concession on both questions removes all substantive doubt about the merits. My prediction is now firmly for **reversal in favor of the petitioner**. The residual uncertainty has shifted from the outcome to the procedural mechanism the Court will use to deliver that outcome\u2014most likely a summary disposition given the lack of any remaining controversy between the parties.",
