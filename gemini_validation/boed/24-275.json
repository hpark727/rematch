    "facts_of_the_case": "While serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in 2017, Donte Parrish sued the United States for $5 million, claiming prison officials unlawfully held him in administrative segregation for three years. After the district court dismissed his case in March 2020, Parrish did not receive notice of the dismissal until June 2020 due to his transfer to state custody. He promptly filed a notice of appeal, which the appeals court treated as a request to reopen his appeal time. The district court granted this request in January 2021, giving him 14 days to file a new appeal, but Parrish missed this deadline and instead sent a supplemental brief to the appeals court a few days late. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

The petition is the foundational document that will articulate the petitioner's entire legal theory, identify the specific rules at issue (e.g., FRAP 4(a)(2), 4(a)(6)), and detail the alleged circuit split. This information is essential and will cause a massive update to my task beliefs, moving from a general hypothesis to a concrete analytical framework. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is moderate. This action confirms a fundamental and highly effective strategy: in any SCOTUS case, the first step should be to analyze the cert petition. While this reinforces a core principle of my design, it's a confirmation of a known best practice rather than the discovery of a novel strategic insight.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1. On April 7, 2017, Parrish drafted and signed a \nfederal complaint seeking compensation for the years \nhe wrongfully spent in administrative segregation and \ndelivered that complaint for mailing.  JA16\u201325, 132\u2013\n34.  The District Court received his complaint and \ndeemed it filed on May 3, 2017.  JA25. \nAfter multiple rounds of briefing, the District Court \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an opinion and order dated \nMarch 23, 2020 and a judgment dated March 24, 2020.  \nPet.App.55a, 57a, 59a.  Both documents were mailed \nto the federal prison in Illinois where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But \nunbeknownst to the court, Parrish was in the process \nof being transferred from federal to state custody.  Id.; \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address) (Apr. \n14, 2020).  As a result, Parrish did not receive notice \nof the judgment against him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat \nthe earliest,\u201d Pet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its \nentry and long after the time to file a notice of appeal \nhad expired, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted promptly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  Within 14 days of receiving \nnotice of the judgment, he filed a document entitled \n\u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; see D.Ct. Dkt. No. \n131-1 (notice of appeal envelope).  In that document, \nParrish explained the reason for his delay:  \u201cDue to my \nbeing transferred from Federal to State custody I did \nnot receive this order until June 25, 2020.  It is now \n7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of appeal.\u201d  \nPet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit construed that filing \nas a motion to reopen the appeal period under Rule \n\n13 \n \n4(a)(6) and remanded for the District Court to rule on \nthe motion.  Id. at 56a\u201358a. \nThe District Court found that Parrish had received \nnotice of the judgment more than 21 days after its \nentry, that he had moved for reopening within 14 days \nof receiving notice, and that no party would be \nprejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at 61a \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  It therefore reopened \nthe appeal period for 14 days.  Id. at 61a\u201362a.  It \nfurther directed the clerk to \u201csupplement th[e] Court\u2019s \nrecord accordingly, and transmit the same to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a. \n3. The case then returned to the Fourth Circuit.  \nThere, both Parrish and the Government agreed that \nParrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had become effective \nin light of the reopened appeal period.  See Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) at 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 \n(U.S. Br.) at 1. \nThe Fourth Circuit disagreed.  A divided panel \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, \nholding that he had \u201cnot file[d] a timely notice of \nappeal.\u201d  Pet.App.2a.  In so doing, the panel majority \nrecognized that the District Court had properly \nreopened the appeal period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6).  Id. at 4a\u20135a.  It reasoned, however, \nthat Parrish was required to file a new notice of appeal \nwithin the reopened appeal period\u2014i.e., 14 days from \nthe District Court\u2019s order.  Id. at 12a\u201313a.  And it \nrejected Parrish\u2019s argument \u201cthat when the district \ncourt reopened the time to appeal . . . , it \u2018validated\u2019 his \nprior untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 5a\u20136a.  \nAlthough the panel majority agreed that earlier-filed \n\n14 \n \nnotices of appeal can ripen when a district court grants \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension motion, the panel rejected \nthat principle for Rule 4(a)(6) reopening motions.  \nAccording to the panel, \u201creopening\u201d is different from \n\u201cextending.\u201d  Id. at 6a, 9a\u201312a.  Moreover, \u201cParrish\u2019s \nearlier filing ha[d] already been construed\u201d as a \nmotion to reopen and, in the majority\u2019s view, could not \nalso serve as a notice of appeal.  Id. at 3a\u20134a. \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He would \nhave held that Parrish\u2019s initial, pre-reopening notice \nof appeal sufficed to confer jurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s \nappeal.  Id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory pointed \nout that the Courts of Appeals consistently hold \u201cthat \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension retroactively validates an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And in \nJudge Gregory\u2019s view, the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted \ndistinction\u201d between reopening and extending an \nappeal period \u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. \nat 20a.  He also rejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s July 2020 filing cannot simultaneously \nserve as both a notice of appeal and a motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  In response, the Government agreed with \nParrish that the panel had erred in holding that it \nlacked jurisdiction.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, 12.  As \na result, the Government took \u201cno position with \nrespect to Parrish\u2019s request for panel rehearing.\u201d  Id. \nat 2.  But it opposed rehearing en banc on the ground \nthat, in its view, this issue was not \u201csufficiently \nimportant to warrant the intervention of the en banc \ncourt.\u201d  Id. \n\n15 \n \nThe panel denied rehearing over Judge Gregory\u2019s \ndissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the Fourth Circuit \ndenied rehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Id. at 63a\u2013\n64a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a statement in support of \nthe en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u201367a.  Judge Gregory, \njoined by three other judges, wrote a dissent.  Id. at \n67a\u201369a. \n\u201cAt its core,\u201d the dissenters explained, \u201cthis case \nrequires us to determine whether access to [appellate \ncourts] should be foreclosed for failure to refile a notice \nof appeal during the newly reopened period following \nsuccess under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a.  That issue, \nthe dissenters recognized, has \u201csplit\u201d \u201ccircuit courts \nand judges.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  And it is a question of \n\u201cexceptional \nimportance,\u201d \nincluding \nbecause \nit \ndisproportionately harms \u201cpopulations who may not \nbe \nable \nto \nconsistently \naccess \ninformation \nelectronically\u201d and has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects.\u201d  Id. at 68a\u201369a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThe Courts of Appeals are divided on the recurring \nquestion whether a notice of appeal filed before an \nappeal period is reopened becomes sufficient once a \ndistrict court reopens the appeal period, or whether a \nnew and duplicative notice of appeal is required after \nreopening.  This issue is profoundly important to the \npro se litigants it most frequently affects.  The decision \nbelow is wrong.  And this case is an excellent vehicle.  \nCertiorari should be granted. \nI. \nTHE COURTS OF APPEALS ARE DIVIDED. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit held that \na litigant must file a new notice of appeal after a \ndistrict court reopens the time to appeal under Rule \n\n16 \n \n4(a)(6).  Five Courts of Appeals disagree and hold that \na previously filed notice of appeal ripens once a Rule \n4(a)(6) motion is granted.  That split is entrenched:  \nThe Fourth Circuit has declined to reconsider its \nposition en banc, and three other circuits have \nacknowledged the split and adhered to their positions \nsince the panel\u2019s decision below. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Requires a New, Post-\nReopening Notice of Appeal. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit dismissed \nParrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did \nnot file a new notice of appeal after the District Court \nreopened the appeal period.  Pet.App.1a; see supra, at \n13\u201314.  In so doing, the court held that an order \ngranting a motion to reopen under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) does not \u201cvalidate [an] earlier filed \nuntimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.10a; see id. at 5a\u2013\n6a.  It further reasoned that a single filing cannot \nsimultaneously serve as a motion to reopen and a \nnotice of appeal.  See id. at 3a\u20134a.  Accordingly, \nlitigants in the Fourth Circuit who file a notice of \nappeal before a motion to reopen is granted must file \na second, duplicative notice within 14 days of the \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order to pursue an appeal.  \nId. at 12a\u201313a. \nAlthough the decision below recognized that a prior \nFourth Circuit panel had accepted jurisdiction based \non a pre-reopening notice of appeal, the court \ndefinitively rejected that position.  Id. at 12a \n(discussing Grant v. City of Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x 236 \n(4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam)).  \u201cThis unpublished \ndecision,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdoes not, in its one short \nparagraph, conduct any analysis of the Rule 4(a)(6) \n\n17 \n \nissue\u201d and \u201chardly constitutes binding, persuasive \nauthority.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the prior decision itself \ndisclaimed any precedential value.  Grant, 810 F. \nApp\u2019x at 236 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not binding \nprecedent in this circuit.\u201d). \nThe decision below thus reflects the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndefinitive answer to the Question Presented.  And the \nFourth Circuit declined to reconsider its position en \nbanc\u2014despite the parties\u2019 agreement that the panel \nhad erred, despite a dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc, and despite its recognition of the \ncircuit split.  See supra, at 14\u201315.  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nposition is thus deeply entrenched. \nB. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits Do Not Require a New, \nPost-Reopening Notice of Appeal.  \nThe Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth \nCircuits disagree with the Fourth Circuit and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants reopening under Rule 4(a)(6).  In \nthose jurisdictions, Parrish\u2019s appeal would have been \nheard on the merits. \n1. In Winters v. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. \n2023), the Sixth Circuit held that an appellant who \nfiles a notice of appeal prior to a reopening order does \nnot need to file a second, post-reopening notice of \nappeal.  The facts of that case are substantively \nindistinguishable from the facts of this one.  Like \nParrish, Winters was a pro se inmate who did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment because \nhe had been moved from one correctional facility to \nanother.  Id. at 667.  Like Parrish, Winters promptly \nfiled a notice of appeal that was treated as a motion to \n\n18 \n \nreopen.  See id. at 668.  And like Parrish, Winters did \nnot file a new notice of appeal within 14 days after the \norder reopening the appeal period.  See id. \nBut unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held \nthat \u201cWinters did not need to file a new notice of \nappeal after the district court granted the motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id at 671.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit \nrecognized that \u201cthe courts of appeal are not all in tune \non these issues.\u201d  Id. at 672 (citing, inter alia, the \ndecision below).  And it rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nanalysis at every turn.  A premature notice, the court \nreasoned, \u201cripens when the window to appeal \nbegins\u201d\u2014no matter whether the event triggering the \nappeal period is the entry of final judgment, Rule 54(b) \ncertification, or Rule 4(a)(6) reopening.  Id. at 671 \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2) (final judgment), and \nGood v. Ohio Edison Co., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. \n1997) (Rule 54(b) certification)).  And \u201ca single \npleading may serve more than one function\u2014for \nexample, . . . a notice of appeal may serve as a motion \nfor an extension of time.\u201d  Id. at 669\u201370 (citing Smith \nv. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 249 (1992)). \n2. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in \nUnited States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th \nCir. 2011).  Like Parrish and Winters, Withers\u2014\nanother pro se inmate\u2014filed an untimely notice of \nappeal.  See id.  And like Parrish and Winters, Withers \nexplained in his notice that he received the judgment \nonly after the initial appeal period had expired.  See \nid.  The Ninth Circuit held that the district court \nshould have construed Withers\u2019 notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted it.  Id.  It \nfurther held that the pre-reopening notice of appeal \nwas sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.  See id.  \n\n19 \n \n3. The Third, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have \nendorsed the same rule, albeit in unpublished \ndecisions. \na. In Holden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 \n(3d Cir. Dec. 20, 2023), the Third Circuit considered an \nappeal in the same mold as Parrish\u2019s, Winters\u2019, and \nWithers\u2019:  A pro se inmate received notice of a \njudgment \nafter \nthe \ntime \nto \nappeal \nexpired, \nimmediately filed a document captioned \u201cnotice of \nappeal,\u201d was granted reopening under Rule 4(a)(6), \nand did not file a new notice of appeal during the 14-\nday reopening period.  See id. at *1, n.4.  The Third \nCircuit recognized that the \u201cappeal [was] timely, and \n[that] [it] ha[d] jurisdiction,\u201d notwithstanding the \nabsence of a post-reopening notice of appeal.  Id. \nb. The Seventh Circuit has addressed this issue \nboth before and after the decision below.  First, in \nNorwood v. East Allen County Schools, 825 F. App\u2019x \n383 (7th Cir. 2020), the appellant\u2014a school teacher \nacting pro se\u2014filed a notice titled \u201cBelated Appeal\u201d \nthat explained he had not received timely notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 386.  The district court \nconstrued the notice as a motion to reopen and granted \nit, finding no evidence that the teacher had been \nserved with the judgment.  See Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., No. 15-cv-249, Dkt. No. 196, at 3 (N.D. \nInd. Feb. 26, 2019).  The teacher did not file a new \nnotice of appeal during the 14-day reopening period.  \n825 F. App\u2019x at 386.  But the Seventh Circuit held that \nthe teacher\u2019s initial notice had become effective when \nthe appeal period was reopened.  Id.  \u201cThat [he] filed it \nbefore the judge reopened the window to appeal\u201d did \nnot \u201caffect its timeliness,\u201d the court reasoned, because \n\u201ca prematurely filed notice of appeal becomes effective \n\n20 \n \nafter the district court enters the order that opens the \ntime to appeal.\u201d  Id. at 387. \nIn Hammer v. Bortz, 2024 WL 2559204 (7th Cir. \nMay 24, 2024), the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the \ncircuit split created by the decision below but adhered \nto its position.  See id. at *3.  The appellant\u2014a pro se \ninmate\u2014learned of the judgment against him only \nafter inquiring about the status of his case.  Id. at *2.  \nAnd he filed a notice of appeal accompanied by a \ndeclaration explaining that he had only just received \nuntimely notice of the adverse judgment.  See id.  The \nSeventh Circuit construed that filing as a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion, and the district court granted it.  Id.  Although \n\u201cHammer did not file a new notice of appeal\u201d during \nthe 14-day reopening period, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat his initial notice \u201cbecame effective\u201d \u201cwhen the \njudge accepted [his] explanation and granted the \nmotion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at *3. \nIn so holding, the Seventh Circuit observed that \n\u201c[o]ther circuits that have addressed this question \nhave reached divergent conclusions on whether the \nfailure to file a new notice of appeal after the time is \nreopened deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction.\u201d  \nId. (citing the decision below and Winters, 88 F.4th at \n671).  Recognizing that its prior \u201cpractice ha[d] aligned \nwith the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\u201d\u2014not the Fourth\u2019s\u2014the court \nagain held that \u201ca second notice of appeal within the \nreopened window for appeal\u201d is not required.  Id. \nc. The Tenth Circuit reached the same result in both \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998), and Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022).  In \nMarshall, a pro se inmate filed a late notice of appeal \n\n21 \n \nafter notice of a judgment against him was mailed to \nthe wrong prison.  See 1998 WL 864012, at *2.  The \ndistrict court then granted his motion to reopen the \nappeal period.  See id.  Relying on circuit precedent \naddressing Rule 4(a)(5) motions, the Tenth Circuit \nheld that \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of a Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(6) motion validates a notice of appeal filed prior \nto the entry of such an order.\u201d  Id. (footnote omitted)).  \nIn the Rule 4(a)(6) context, just as in the Rule 4(a)(5) \ncontext, \u201cto require the filing of a new notice of appeal \nwould amount to little more than empty paper \nshuffling.\u201d  Id. (quoting Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 \nF.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nSimilarly, in Farrow, the appellant\u2014yet another \npro se inmate\u2014filed a notice of appeal at the same \ntime as a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen, asking the \ncourt \u201cto process the notice once it had addressed his \nmotion.\u201d  2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1.  He never filed a \nsecond notice after the motion to reopen was granted.  \nBut the Tenth Circuit held that the previously filed \nnotice \nof \nappeal \n\u201cbecame \neffective, \nconferring \n[appellate] jurisdiction\u201d when the appeal period was \nreopened.  Id. \n* \n* \n* \nThe circuits are thus openly divided about whether \nthey have jurisdiction to hear appeals like Parrish\u2019s.  \nHad Parrish been incarcerated in the Third, Sixth, \nSeventh, Ninth, or Tenth Circuits, his appeal would \nhave been decided on its merits.  But because he was \nincarcerated in the Fourth Circuit, his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Courts on both sides \nof the split have acknowledged the division of \nauthority, and the Fourth Circuit has refused to \n\n22 \n \nreconsider its outlier position.  Only this Court can \nrestore uniformity. \nII. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT. \nThe division of authority on the Question Presented \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  This issue recurs even \nmore frequently than the decisions above suggest.  \nAnd when it does arise, it is outcome-determinative of \na litigant\u2019s right to appeal. \n1.a. Courts encounter cases like Parrish\u2019s all the \ntime.  In just one week in December 2023, for example, \nthe Third Circuit and the Sixth Circuit both issued \ndecisions holding that a duplicative notice of appeal is \nnot required.  See Winters, 88 F.4th 665 (6th Cir. Dec. \n15, 2023); Holden, 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. Dec. 20, \n2023).  The Fourth Circuit was considering Parrish\u2019s \nen banc petition during the same time.  And in June \n2024, the Fourth Circuit dismissed at least three \nappeals in the same posture as Parrish\u2019s.  See Sparks \nv. Russell, 2024 WL 2862119 (4th Cir. June 6, 2024); \nHammond v. Burns, 2024 WL 3102794 (4th Cir. June \n24, 2024) (consolidating and dismissing two appeals). \nThose cases, moreover, are just the tip of the \niceberg.  Although the Question Presented is \njurisdictional, its answer is often undisputed by the \nparties.  See, e.g., Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1 \n(agreeing that no second notice was required).  As a \nresult, courts frequently proceed to the merits without \ndiscussing the potential problem.  See, e.g., Dec v. \nPennsylvania, 2024 WL 3338301 (3d Cir. July 9, 2024); \nMcKenzie v. Wolfe, 2024 WL 399104 (4th Cir. Feb. 2, \n2024).  That means that the outcome of substantively \nidentical appeals can turn not only on the circuit in \nwhich each appeal is filed but also on the \n\n23 \n \nhappenstance of whether each panel happens to notice \nthe potential jurisdictional flaw.  It also means that \nthe Question Presented almost certainly arises in \nmany more cases than the opinions addressing it \nreflect. \nb. That should come as no surprise.  Last year, pro \nse litigants filed nearly half of all notices of appeal.  \nSee 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 9 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2023), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/\n2023year-endreport.pdf.  And close to 90% of prisoner \nappeals were filed pro se.  Id. \nPro se litigants are exponentially more likely to \nreceive untimely notice of a judgment than counseled \nparties.  Whereas attorneys receive immediate notice \nthrough electronic case-filing systems, pro se litigants \nreceive notice by snail mail.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n77(d)(1) (requiring clerk to notify parties of orders and \njudgments as provided by Rule 5(b), which provides for \nservice by mail upon pro se litigants).  Unlike \nelectronic notifications, mail often gets delayed in \ntransit.  See U.S. Postal Serv., Analysis of FY 2023 \nPerformance \n31 \n(2024), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2803_2\n804%20Report_Final.pdf (\u201cIn FY 2023, the Postal \nService failed to meet six out of its eight targets for\u201d \nfirst-class mail products, including late delivery of \nnearly 20 percent of mail meant to be delivered within \nthree to five days); U.S. Postal Serv. Office of Inspector \nGeneral, Spring 2024 Semiannual Report to Congress \n17 (2024), available at https://www.uspsoig.gov/\nsites/default/files/reports/2024-05/FY2024_Spring\n_SARC.pdf (reporting problems with timely mail \ndelivery in 95% of audited locations).  And unlike \n\n24 \n \nemail addresses, physical addresses do not follow \npeople around when they move\u2014which can cause \ndelivery failures and forwarding delays.  See, e.g., \nAcosta v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, 2021 WL \n5395997, \nat \n*3 \n(N.D. \nTex. \n2021) \n(discussing \ndocumentation of USPS mail forwarding delays of up \nto 10 days); Gallegos-Lopez v. Kansas City, 2009 WL \n2912637, at *2 (D. Kan. Sept. 9, 2009) (USPS failed to \ntimely forward EEOC\u2019s right-to-sue letter to new \naddress); Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., dissenting) (\u201cRule \n4(a)(6) is usually invoked under circumstances where \na party relocates, is relocated, or is otherwise unable \nto receive mail at the address listed with the court.\u201d). \nPro se prisoners face even more serious obstacles to \nobtaining timely notice\u2014and have less power to \nmitigate them.  See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, \n270\u201372 (1988) (pointing out pro se prisoners\u2019 lack of \ncontrol over outgoing mail); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49, Adv. \nComm. Notes (2018 Amendment) (recognizing that \n\u201cincarcerated individuals . . . often lack reliable access \nto the internet or email\u201d).  Prison mail systems are \nnotoriously slow.  See Advisory Comm. on Appellate \nRules, Agenda for Fall 2016 Meeting 163 (2016), \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2016-10-\nappellate-agenda-book_0.pdf \n(reporter\u2019s \nmemorandum identifying recurring legal questions \narising from \u201cdelay by prison authorities in delivering\u201d \ncourt orders to prisoners); Dallas Morning News, Mail \nDelays \nFrustrate \nPrisoners \n(Nov. \n12, \n2023) \n(documenting delays of three weeks to two months in \nTexas prisons\u2019 mail processing); Penton v. Johnson, \n2023 WL 7121407, at *2\u20133 (9th Cir. Oct. 30, 2023) \n(denying qualified immunity to prison officials who \nfailed to forward a transferred prisoner\u2019s mail \u201cfor over \n\n25 \n \nseven months\u201d).  And prisoners are often moved \nbetween facilities without notice.  See U.S. Marshals \nServs. Office of Pub. Affairs, Fact Sheet: Prisoner \nTransportation, \nhttps://www.usmarshals.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/media/document/2024-Prisoner-\nTransportation.pdf (reporting nearly a quarter million \nprisoner movements by the Marshals Service in FY \n2023, at an average pace of almost 1,000 prisoner \nmovements each day); Grandison v. Moore, 786 F.2d \n146, 149 (3d Cir. 1986) (\u201cPrisoners . . . have no control \nover their whereabouts, and may be temporarily \ntransferred out of the prison for court proceedings or \nplaced in administrative or punitive segregation which \ncan delay mail delivery.\u201d); see, e.g., Pet.App.60a\u201361a; \nWinters, 88 F.4th at 671.  Indeed, Mr. Parrish has been \nheld in three different institutions just this calendar \nyear. \nWith tens of thousands of pro se appeals filed each \nyear, even a low rate of mail-delivery delay or failure \nproduces a meaningful number of cases where a \nlitigant must rely on Rule 4(a)(6) for the chance to \nappeal. \nc. Pro se litigants who belatedly receive an adverse \njudgment often attempt to salvage an appeal in one of \ntwo ways.  Many litigants file a notice of appeal that \ncontains an explanation for their delay.  See, e.g., \nPet.App.71a; Winters, 88 F.4th at 668; Withers, 638 \nF.3d at 1061.  Courts must construe pro se filings \ngenerously, see Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 \n(2007) (per curiam), so such notices are construed as \nRule 4(a)(6) motions.  See Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062.  \nOther litigants file a notice of appeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion simultaneously.  See, e.g., Farrow, 2022 WL \n274489, at *1 n.1.  The upshot in either case is the \n\n26 \n \nsame:  Litigants who try to appeal and explain the \ncircumstances as soon as they learn of the judgment \nagainst them may receive relief in the form of a \nreopened appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6). \nBut some pro se litigants will have no meaningful \nopportunity to file a second notice of appeal within the \n14-day reopening window.  Every litigant who benefits \nfrom Rule 4(a)(6), by definition, previously failed to \nreceive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A).  And if \nsuch a litigant does not receive notice of the reopening \norder before the 14-day window closes, he cannot \npossibly file a second notice of appeal on time. \nEven when litigants do promptly learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened, it may not even \noccur to them that a second notice of appeal might be \nrequired.  The Rules Advisory Committee has long \nrecognized that \u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se \nlitigants, fail to file [a] second notice of appeal.\u201d  Adv. \nComm. Notes (1993 Amendment).  And who could \nblame them, given that courts often affirmatively \ninform litigants that they need not file a duplicative \nnotice.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Lamanna, 2021 WL \n1759924, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2021) (\u201cPlaintiff need \nnot file a new notice of appeal.\u201d); Jacoby v. Thomas, \n2019 WL 3226896, at *3 (M.D. Ala. July 17, 2019) \n(\u201c[Plaintiff] is not required to file a new notice of \nappeal.\u201d); Brown v. United States, 2010 WL 376922, at \n*1 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2010) (previously filed notice of \nappeal \u201cshall be deemed timely filed\u201d upon reopening \nof appeal period).  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit initially \nsuggested as much in this very case.  See Pet.App.58a \n(\u201cThe record, as supplemented, will be returned to this \ncourt for further consideration.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \n2. In addition to recurring frequently, the Question \nPresented also has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those it \naffects.\u201d  Pet.App.69a (Gregory, J., dissenting).  That \nis because a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional \nrequirement.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214.  This Court \nhas already held that an appeal must be dismissed if \na notice of appeal is filed after the 14-day reopening \nperiod has expired.  See id. at 207\u201309.  And neither 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107 nor the Federal Rules authorizes courts \nto extend or reopen the reopening window under any \ncircumstances.  See id. at 214 (\u201cCourt[s] ha[ve] no \nauthority to create equitable exceptions[.]\u201d). \nAs a result, litigants who do not learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened (or that a second \nnotice is required) until after the 14-day window has \nclosed are left with no possibility of recourse.  That is \ntrue no matter the strength of their appellate \narguments or how inequitable that result might be. \nThe harsh consequences of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule \nare particularly troubling given the population this \nissue \u201cmost commonly\u201d affects: \u201cpro se litigants who \nwere unable to notice their intent to seek [appellate] \nreview during the statutory appeals period, often due \nto no fault of their own.\u201d  Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., \ndissenting).  These litigants are disproportionately \n\u201celderly, \nunhoused, \ndetained, \nimprisoned, \n. . . \ndifferently abled,\u201d or otherwise unable \u201cto consistently \naccess information electronically.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s rule thus \u201crequire[s] more of those \nwho have less.\u201d  Id. at 69a. \n \n\n28 \n \nIII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S POSITION IS WRONG. \nAs the Government recognized below, see Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 84, at 2, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s minority rule is \nalso simply wrong.  Like other premature notices of \nappeal, notices of appeal filed before the appeal period \nis reopened become effective once a motion to reopen \nis granted.  The use of the word \u201creopen\u201d in Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) does not justify a different \nresult.  And there is no reason why a notice of appeal \ncannot serve two functions at once. \n1.a. Unlike filing a notice of appeal too late, filing a \nnotice of appeal too early does not \u201cextinguish an \notherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  \nThat principle\u2014sometimes called the doctrine of \n\u201ccumulative finality,\u201d see generally Bryan Lammon, \nCumulative Finality, 52 GA. L. REV. 767 (2018)\u2014\nfollows from this Court\u2019s functional approach to \nnotices of appeal.  See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. \n757, 767 (2001) (holding that a notice suffices so long \nas there is \u201cno genuine doubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, to which appellate court\u201d).  \nTaking that same functional approach, the Courts of \nAppeals have long held that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal becomes procedurally \nproper.  See, e.g., Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d \nCir. 1975) (notice filed after announcement of a \ndecision but before the entry of judgment); Firchau v. \nDiamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269, 271 (9th Cir. 1965) \n(notice filed after dismissal of a complaint but before \ndismissal of the entire action); Bryant v. Elliott, 467 \nF.2d 1109,1109 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (notice \nfiled after expiration of the appeal period but before \nextension was granted).  And this Court expressly \nendorsed the ripening principle in FirsTier.  See 498 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. at 274 (\u201cconclud[ing] that Rule 4(a)(2) permits a \nnotice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to \nserve as an effective notice from a subsequently \nentered final judgment\u201d). \nThe ripening principle is also reflected in the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  It appears in \nRule 4(a)(2), which provides that \u201c[a] notice of appeal \nfiled after the court announces a decision or order\u2014\nbut before the entry of the judgment or order\u2014is \ntreated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\u201d  It \nis reflected in Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(i), which provides that \u201ca \nnotice of appeal\u201d filed \u201cafter the court announces or \nenters a judgment\u2014but before it disposes of [certain] \nmotion[s] listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014 . . . becomes \neffective . . . when the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion is entered.\u201d  And it appears in an \nanalogous provision for criminal appeals, too.  See \nRule 4(b)(2).  These provisions were added to the \nFederal Rules in 1979 in \u201crecogni[tion]\u201d of the pre-\nexisting consensus among the Courts of Appeals that \n\u201cpremature appeals\u201d are \u201ceffective.\u201d  Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1979 Amendment). \nConsistent with that broader principle and this \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in FirsTier, the Courts of Appeals \nconsistently hold that prematurely filed notices of \nappeal ripen not only in the circumstances covered by \nRules 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(4)(B)(i), but also in contexts not \naddressed by those provisions.  Most notably, the \nCourts of Appeals uniformly recognize that a notice of \nappeal filed before a needed Rule 54(b) certification \nripens once that certification is obtained\u2014even though \nRule 4 does not expressly provide for ripening in that \nsituation.  See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, \n1184\u201385 (1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); Tilden Fin. \n\n30 \n \nCorp. v. Palo Tire Serv., Inc., 596 F.2d 604, 607 (3d Cir. \n1979); Good, 104 F.3d at 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n \nof Bds. of Pharm. v. Bd. of Regents, 633 F.3d 1297, \n1307 (11th Cir. 2011); State Contracting & Eng\u2019g Corp. \nv. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1334\u201335 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \nb. The same principle\u2014that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal period opens\u2014controls \nhere, too.  That result follows directly from this Court\u2019s \nholding in FirsTier.  And it is consistent with the way \npremature notices of appeal are treated in other \ncontexts.   \nIt is also consistent with the functional approach to \nnotices of appeal, because a second, post-reopening \nnotice of appeal serves no conceivable purpose.  Once \nthe initial notice is filed, there can be \u201cno genuine \ndoubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, from what judgment, \nto which appellate court\u201d in this context.  Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767.  If anything, a notice of appeal filed before \nRule 4(a)(6) reopening gives the appellee more notice \nof the coming appeal than one filed after reopening.  \nAnd an appellee will never be prejudiced when an \nappeal proceeds based on the premature notice, \nbecause Rule 4(a)(6) reopening is available only if the \ndistrict court finds that no prejudice will flow from \nreopening.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6)(C). \n \nAccordingly, \na \nsecond-notice \nrequirement would be a \u201chollow ritual\u201d that amounts \nto nothing more than \u201cpaper shuffling.\u201d  Hinton, 997 \nF.3d at 778 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd at what cost.  It would create a trap for unwary \npro se litigants.  See supra, at 23\u201327.  And even where \npro se litigants do manage to spot the tripwire, it \nwould still leave some litigants in the lurch through no \n\n31 \n \nfault of their own, because litigants eligible for relief \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) may not even learn of an order \ngranting a motion to reopen until after the 14-day \nreopening period expires.  After all, they necessarily \ndid not learn of a judgment within a longer 21-day \nperiod.  See supra, at 26. \n2. The Fourth Circuit did not even cite FirsTier.  \nAnd it offered no justification for deviating from the \nbackground presumption of cumulative finality.  \nInstead, it relied on an untenable distinction between \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) and \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).  According to the Fourth Circuit, \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) contemplates an \nunbroken period from the entry of the appealable \norder to the end of the extended appeal period.  \nPet.App.9a\u201312a.  That continuity, it reasoned, is what \nallows a premature notice of appeal to ripen when a \nRule 4(a)(5) extension motion is granted.  Id.  By \ncontrast, the Fourth Circuit insisted that \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) creates a new, noncontiguous \nappeal period.  Id. at 9a\u201310a.  As a result, it concluded \nthat a premature notice of appeal does not ripen when \na Rule 4(a)(6) motion is granted.  See id. \nBoth premises underlying that analysis are wrong.   \na. The first faulty premise is that an extension \nunder Rule 4(a)(5)\u2014unlike reopening under Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014necessarily involves an unbroken appeal \nperiod.  By the plain terms of \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(5), a motion for an extension can be filed up to 30 \ndays after the appeal period has lapsed.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).  Indeed, this Court \nrecently cited Rule 4(a)(5) extension motions as an \nexample of extensions that do not necessarily involve \n\n32 \n \na continuous period of time.  In HollyFrontier, the \nCourt held that refineries may receive a benefit in \nYear 1, not receive that benefit in Year 2, and then \nreceive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same benefit in Year 3.  \n594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, it relied on an \nanalogy to Rule (4)(a)(5) extensions.  \u201cUnder certain \ncircumstances,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca court \u2018may . . . \nextend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 even \u2018after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)).  \n\u201cIn other words, the timer can start, run, finish, and \nthen restart\u201d\u2014precisely \u201cbecause a court has the \npower to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after a lapse.\u201d  \nId. at 391. \nHollyFrontier \nthus \nexpressly \nrejected \nthe \nproposition that extensions always \u201cretroactively \ndeem[] the time originally allotted as now extending \ncontinuously to some new and future due date.\u201d  Id. at \n392.  Indeed, the Court recognized that when Congress \nwants to retroactively create continuity via an \nextension, it says so\u2014including by using modifiers like \n\u201cconsecutive\u201d or \u201csuccessive.\u201d  See id.  And Congress \nsaid nothing of the sort in \u00a7 2107(c).  So Rule 4(a)(5) \nmotions do not necessarily result in an unbroken \nappeal period any more than Rule 4(a)(6) motions do. \nEven if Rule 4(a)(5) relief did retroactively create a \nsingle, continuous appeal period, the Fourth Circuit \nlacked any basis for concluding that Rule 4(a)(6) relief \ndoes not operate in the same way.  Both Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) refer to reopening \u201cthe time \nfor appeal\u201d or \u201cthe time to file an appeal.\u201d  Insomuch \nas extensions result in a continuous appeal period, \nthat language suggests a continuous appeal period \nunder the reopening mechanism, too. \n\n33 \n \nb. The second faulty premise is that a notice of \nappeal can ripen only when it is retroactively deemed \nto have been filed during a continuous, unbroken \nappeal period.  The Fourth Circuit created that \ncontinuity requirement from whole cloth, with no \nbasis in text.  And that novel requirement contradicts \nthis Court\u2019s functional approach to notices of appeal. \nThe function of a notice of appeal\u2014as its name \nsuggests\u2014is to put courts and other parties on notice \nthat a litigant is pursuing an appeal.  See Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767; FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  A premature \nnotice plainly serves that function regardless of \nwhether the appeal period is later deemed to have \nbeen continuous all along.  After all, retroactively \ndeeming an extended appeal period to have been \ncontinuous \u201ccannot change the fact that, absent time \ntravel, a lapse or interruption has occurred.\u201d  \nHollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 392. \nMoreover, imposing a continuity requirement for \nripening would upset the longstanding consensus \namong Courts of Appeals that a notice of appeal filed \nbefore Rule 54(b) certification ripens once certification \nis obtained.  See supra, at 29\u201330.  And to the extent \nthis continuity requirement is jurisdictional, it \nthreatens the viability of Rule 4(a)(2) and Rule \n4(a)(4)(B)(i) as well.  In all of these contexts, the initial \nnotice is not filed within a continuous appeal period\u2014\nor, indeed, within any appeal period at all. \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s passing suggestion \nthat a single filing cannot serve as both a notice of \nappeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) motion is meritless.  See \nPet.App.3a\u20134a.  Indeed, this Court has already \nreversed the Fourth Circuit for making the same \n\n34 \n \nfundamental mistake in another case.  In Smith, this \nCourt held that even though the \u201cFederal Rules do \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings,\u201d the Rules \u201cdo not \npreclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  502 U.S. at 249.  \nA notice of appeal, in other words, need not be filed on \na separate piece of paper that serves no other purpose.  \nSee id.  That logic compels the conclusion that a notice \nof appeal can also serve as a motion to reopen.  See, \ne.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 669\u201370 (Winters\u2019s filing \u201cmay \nserve more than one function\u201d); Withers, 638 F.3d at \n1062 (\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 387 (rejecting the argument \nthat a Rule 4(a)(6) \u201cmotion . . . cannot be construed as \na notice of appeal\u201d). \nIV. THE CASE IS AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE. \nFinally, this case is an ideal vehicle for answering \nthe Question Presented.  The question whether a \nprematurely filed notice of appeal can ripen upon Rule \n4(a)(6) reopening was fully briefed and definitively \nanswered below.  And it was the sole ground for the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s ruling.  See Pet.App.2a (\u201cBecause \nDonte Parrish did not file a timely notice of appeal \nfrom the judgment in this civil action, we dismiss his \nappeal for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).   \nTo the extent the Government again sides with \nParrish on the merits, see Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, \nthat is no basis for declining review.  This Court \nregularly grants certiorari and appoints an amicus \ncuriae to defend a Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling where there \n\n35 \n \nis no dispute between the parties on the Question \nPresented.  See, e.g., Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, \n336 (2022); Lange v. California, 594 U.S. 295, 301 \n(2021); McLane Co. v. E.E.O.C., 581 U.S. 72, 79 (2017).  \nIt should take the same tack here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nSeptember 9, 2024 \n \nAmanda R.

Based on the new observation, my understanding has been refined. I now recognize that the central issue is a technical, procedural question of federal appellate jurisdiction. Specifically, the case will turn on whether a notice of appeal filed in the \"gap\" period\u2014after the original appeal deadline has expired but before the district court has formally granted a motion to reopen the appeal time\u2014is effective, or if a new notice of appeal is required after the court's order. The governing law for this question is almost certainly the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP). My prediction will depend on the interpretation of these rules and the body of case law applying them, particularly precedents concerning the timing of notices of appeal and whether such a filing can be considered \"premature\" and thus saved by a subsequent court order. The next critical step is to analyze the petitioner's arguments in the petition for a writ of certiorari to understand the specific rules and precedents at issue.",

The potential information gain is very high for several reasons: 1) It will reveal the United States' official position, which could range from a full-throated defense of the outlier Fourth Circuit rule to a confession of error, the latter of which would make a reversal nearly certain. 2) It will provide the strongest counter-arguments to the petitioner's reliance on *FirsTier*, allowing me to assess the true strength of the legal dispute and refine my prediction. 3) From a design perspective, observing how the Solicitor General handles a lopsided circuit split where the government won provides invaluable data for a general predictive model of SG behavior, a key institutional actor.

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of appeal is best viewed as \n\u201cpremature\u201d to the reopened period, and \u201cthe technical \n\n12 \n \ndefect of prematurity  * * *  should not be allowed to \nextinguish an otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier \nMortg., 498 U.S. at 273; cf. Pet. App. 16a-18a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting) (drawing additional support from cir-\ncuit precedent giving effect to untimely notices of ap-\npeal filed before the time for appeal is extended under \nRule 4(a)(5)). \n2. Although the decision below is incorrect, peti-\ntioner fails to identify any compelling basis for further \nreview, particularly while the Advisory Committee is \nstudying the issue and has the authority to amend the \nrules in a manner that could obviate any need for addi-\ntional guidance from this Court.  See pp. 16-17, infra. \nPetitioner principally contends (Pet. 15-22) that the \ndecision below implicates a division of authority within \nthe courts of appeals, but petitioner overstates the de-\ngree of any such conflict.  District courts have had the \nauthority to reopen the time for appeal under Section \n2107(c) since 1991.  See Pub. L. No. 102-198, \u00a7 12, 105 \nStat. 1627; see also Fed. R. App. 4 advisory committee\u2019s \nnote (1991 Amendment).  But petitioner identifies (Pet. \n17-18) only one other published decision in which a court \nof appeals squarely addressed the jurisdictional ques-\ntion that petitioner seeks to present here.  See Winters \nv. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.) (concluding that a litigant who filed an untimely \nnotice of appeal and then successfully moved for reo-\npening of the appeal period \u201cdid not need to file a new \nnotice of appeal after the district court granted [his] \nmotion to reopen,\u201d under the principle that \u201c[a] notice \nof appeal filed too early, generally speaking, ripens \nwhen the window to appeal begins\u201d) (citing, inter alia, \nFirsTier Mortg., 498 U.S. at 273). \n\n13 \n \nPetitioner also relies (Pet. 18) on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in United States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055 \n(2011), but that case did not expressly resolve the same \njurisdictional issue.  The Ninth Circuit instead per-\nceived the key jurisdictional issue to be whether a pro \nse litigant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal should have been \n\u201cconstrued  * * *  as a motion to reopen\u201d the appeal pe-\nriod.  Id. at 1061.  After concluding that the district \ncourt should have construed the untimely notice as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted the motion, \nthe court of appeals did not then proceed to address \nwhether the pro se litigant needed to file any further \nnotice of appeal during the reopened period.  Id. at \n1061-1062.  The Ninth Circuit instead appears to have \nassumed that its jurisdiction was proper under those \ncircumstances.  See id. at 1062.  While that result is in-\nconsistent with the result reached by the Fourth Circuit \nhere, the precedential force of Withers remains unclear.  \nThis Court does not afford precedential effect to analo-\ngous \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings.\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citi-\nzens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998).   \nAs petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 19-21), the other \ncircuits to have addressed the same jurisdictional ques-\ntion have done so only in unpublished decisions.  See \nHammer v. Bortz, No. 23-1842, 2024 WL 2559204, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 24, 2024); Holden v. Attorney General of \nN.J., No. 21-1862, 2023 WL 8798084, at *1 n.4 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, No. 21-1027, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1. (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022), cert.  \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 454 (2022); Norwood v. East Allen \nCmty. Schs., 825 Fed. Appx. 383, 386-387 (7th Cir. \n2020); United States v. Marshall, 166 F.3d 349, 1998 \nWL 864012, at *2 (10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998) (Tbl.), cert. \n\n14 \n \ndenied, 528 U.S. 861 (1999).2  Those nonprecedential  \ndecisions would not preclude a future panel from reach-\ning a different conclusion and thus do not necessarily \nshow that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent had it arisen in one of those circuits.  And even \ncounting generously, petitioner has identified fewer \nthan ten opinions on point since reopening motions be-\ncame available in 1991.  The paucity of such decisions \nunderscores that the jurisdictional question does not \narise frequently\u2014and when it does, the courts of ap-\npeals have rarely considered it sufficiently important to \nwarrant a published opinion. \n3. In addition to the absence of any substantial con-\nflict, further review is unwarranted because the ques-\ntion presented lacks practical significance.  The ques-\ntion can arise only through an unlikely combination of \nprocedural missteps.  The district court may reopen the \ntime for appeal only if it first finds that a party entitled \nto receive notice of the entry of a judgment or order \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of the entry \nof the judgment or order.  28 U.S.C 2107(c)(1).  But in \nthe era of electronic filing, most litigants now receive \nimmediate notice of orders and judgments.  Petitioner \nemphasizes (Pet. 23) the possibility that pro se litigants \nmay need to rely on notice via the mail, but \u201c[m]any \ncourts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with \nthe court\u2019s permission,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 5 advisory com-\nmittee\u2019s note (2018 Amendment). \n \n2 Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 21) on Farrow is misplaced for the ad-\nditional reason that the litigant in that case simultaneously filed \nboth a motion to reopen the appeal period and a notice of appeal, \nwhile asking the district court to defer entering the notice until after \ngranting reopening.  See 2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1. \n\n15 \n \nMoreover, even with respect to the presumably small \nnumber of litigants who fail to receive the requisite no-\ntice, the question presented only arises if one of those \nlitigants wishes to appeal, the litigant cannot rely on the \ndistrict court\u2019s separate authority to extend the time for \nappeal, and the litigant makes a timely request that the \nappeal period be reopened\u2014but files a notice of appeal \nonly before the reopening, not after.  Notably, Section \n2107(c) imposes an outer limit of 180 days to request re-\nopening.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (court may act upon a \nmotion filed by the \u201cearlier\u201d of the expiration of 180 \ndays from the entry of the judgment or order at issue \nor 14 days after the moving party receives notice).  If \nthat 180-day period expires before the litigant requests \nreopening, the question presented makes no difference \nbecause the district court lacks authority to reopen the \nappeal period in any event.  And even for a timely re-\nquest, the district court cannot reopen the appeal period \nunless it first finds that \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  \n28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(2).  Petitioner does not demonstrate \nthat such a combination of circumstances is likely to oc-\ncur frequently, and the limited number of appellate deci-\nsions addressing the question presented suggests it does \nnot.  Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own prior court-appointed \ncounsel cited the \u201cthe relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to\u201d as one \nreason for declining to file a petition for rehearing en \nbanc on petitioner\u2019s behalf.  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2. \nPetitioner also overstates (Pet. 22) the practical sig-\nnificance of the decision below within the Fourth Circuit \nitself.  Although the decision below is incorrect, it estab-\nlishes a clear and easily applied jurisdictional rule going \nforward.  District courts in the Fourth Circuit may now \nadvise pro se litigants of the need to file a new notice of \n\n16 \n \nappeal in cases in which a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod is granted.  And although petitioner derides the \nfiling of a second notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod of appeal as a \u201chollow ritual,\u201d Pet. 30 (citation \nomitted), he does not show that filing a second notice \nwill be particularly difficult for most or indeed any liti-\ngants affected by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. \n4. This Court\u2019s review is also unwarranted at the \npresent time because the Advisory Committee has al-\nready taken steps to study whether changes to Rule 4(a) \nmay be warranted.  In Winters, the Sixth Circuit ob-\nserved that the Advisory Committee is \u201ccharge[d]  * * *  \nto review issues of precisely this sort\u201d and has the au-\nthority to \u201cimprov[e] the rules where needed.\u201d  88 F.4th \nat 672.  The Sixth Circuit further observed that the Ad-\nvisory Committee \u201cmay be a profitable next stage for \nthis debate,\u201d ibid.\u2014a sentiment endorsed by the dis-\nsenting judges in this case, see Pet. App. 68a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). \nOn October 9, 2024, after the filing of the petition for \na writ of certiorari in this case, the Advisory Committee \nvoted to form a subcommittee to address the issues \nraised by the Sixth Circuit in Winters and the Fourth \nCircuit in the decision below.  See Memorandum from \nEdward Hartnett to the Advisory Committee on the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, New Suggestion \nfrom Judge Sutton 1-3 (Sept. 5, 2024), reprinted in Ad-\nvisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Tab 7A, at 292-\n295 (Oct. 9, 2024) (reporter\u2019s memorandum describing \nWinters and this case and proposing a subcommittee); \nsee also Jacqueline Thomsen, Administrative Stays \nChanges Weighed After Justices\u2019 Criticism, Bloomberg \nLaw News (Oct. 10, 2024) (noting that the Advisory \nCommittee agreed to \u201clook into the rule on reopening \n\n17 \n \nthe time to file an appeal\u201d in light of Chief Judge Sut-\nton\u2019s suggestion). \nBecause the relevant provisions in Rule 4(a)(6) may \nwell change as a result of the rulemaking process, the \nquestion whether the current language of the rule sup-\nports petitioner may be of limited prospective im-\nportance.  And the Advisory Committee is fully capable \nof addressing the policy concerns that petitioner raises \nhere.  See Pet. 22-27. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \nBRIAN M.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief was that this case concerned a technical, procedural question of federal appellate jurisdiction, specifically whether a notice of appeal filed in the \"gap\" period\u2014after the original deadline expires but before a court grants a motion to reopen the appeal time\u2014is effective. I hypothesized this would turn on the interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) and related precedents.\n\nThe observation of the petition for a writ of certiorari has substantially refined and deepened this belief. I can now confirm the specific legal framework and the central arguments that will shape the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n-   **Governing Law Confirmed:** The petition identifies the precise statute and rule at issue: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and its implementing rule, FRAP 4(a)(6), which both govern the reopening of time to file an appeal when a party did not receive timely notice of a judgment.\n\n-   **Existence of a Deep Circuit Split:** This is the most critical new piece of information. The petition explicitly documents a division among the Courts of Appeals on the question presented.\n    -   **The Minority Position (Fourth Circuit):** Requires a litigant to file a new, second notice of appeal *after* the district court grants a motion to reopen.\n    -   **The Majority Position (Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits):** Holds that a notice of appeal filed in the \"gap\" period automatically becomes effective or \"ripens\" once the court grants the motion to reopen. This is a 5-1 split, positioning the Fourth Circuit as a clear outlier.\n\n-   **Key Precedents and Legal Arguments:** I now have a clear map of the petitioner's legal strategy and the key precedents that will be debated.\n    -   The core of the petitioner's argument rests on the \"premature notice\" doctrine from ***FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Investors Mortg. Ins. Co.***, which holds that certain premature notices of appeal are not a fatal jurisdictional defect and can become effective upon a later court order. The petitioner argues the \"gap\" filing in this case is premature, not tardy.\n    -   The petitioner will argue against a formalistic distinction between \"extending\" time (under FRAP 4(a)(5)) and \"reopening\" time (under FRAP 4(a)(6)), citing the Supreme Court's recent textual interpretation in ***HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n***.\n    -   The argument is framed by the principle from ***Becker v. Montgomery*** that non-prejudicial technical defects should not extinguish an appeal, a principle often applied to aid *pro se* litigants.\n    -   The primary counter-argument, which the respondent (United States) will likely advance, is rooted in ***Bowles v. Russell***, which established that appeal deadlines are jurisdictional and must be strictly enforced. The petitioner's challenge is to characterize the \"gap\" filing as a curable prematurity issue under *FirsTier* rather than an incurable tardiness issue under *Bowles*.\n\n-   **Predictive Factors:** The existence of a clear, acknowledged, and lopsided circuit split is a powerful signal that the Supreme Court will not only grant certiorari to resolve the issue but is also likely to reverse the outlier circuit. The petitioner's arguments appear strong, aligning with the Court's precedent on premature notices (*FirsTier*) and its pragmatic approach to procedural rules (*Becker*), especially given the disproportionate impact on *pro se* litigants, which the petition highlights as an important policy consideration. My prediction now leans strongly toward a reversal of the Fourth Circuit's decision.",

This creates uncertainty about the case's disposition: will the Court grant review (either plenary or summary) to correct the error, or will it deny cert and let the rulemaking process play out? The next logical document to examine is the petitioner's reply brief. This brief will directly respond to the SG's arguments for denial and will articulate why the Court should intervene now despite the committee's review.

This action correctly synthesizes this shift and identifies the new pivotal conflict: the SG's argument for denial (let the Rules Committee handle it) versus the petitioner's need for immediate relief.

The reasoning demonstrates a generalizable and highly valuable strategic principle: when a confession of error is met with an argument for denial based on an alternative (e.g., non-judicial) resolution, the petitioner's reply brief becomes the key indicator of whether the Court will feel compelled to take immediate corrective action or defer.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief, formed from the petition for certiorari, was that this case presented a clear and deep circuit split on a technical but important question of appellate jurisdiction under FRAP 4(a)(6). The petitioner's arguments, leveraging precedents like *FirsTier* to frame the \"gap\" filing as a curable premature notice rather than a fatal tardiness under *Bowles*, appeared strong, especially given the lopsided 5-1 split. My prediction leaned heavily toward a grant of certiorari and a reversal of the Fourth Circuit.\n\nThe observation of the Brief for the Respondent in Opposition, filed by the Solicitor General, has profoundly refined and strengthened my beliefs, while also introducing new procedural complexities.\n\n*   **Confirmation of Error by the U.S. Government:** This is the most significant new signal. The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States, has confessed error. The brief explicitly states, \"The court of appeals erred in concluding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction\" and that \"the government continues to adhere to the view that the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction.\" This is a powerful confirmation of the petitioner's legal arguments. It elevates my confidence to near certainty that the Supreme Court will find the Fourth Circuit's reasoning to be incorrect on the merits. The central legal question\u2014whether the \"gap\" notice is effective\u2014is now almost certainly going to be resolved in the petitioner's favor.\n\n*   **Shift in Predictive Focus from *What* to *How*:** The government's brief, while confessing error on the merits, simultaneously argues that the petition for certiorari should be denied. This creates a nuanced strategic landscape. The key uncertainty is no longer *what* the Court will decide on the legal question, but *how* it will dispose of the case. The possible outcomes are now:\n    *   **Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR):** A very common response to a confession of error. The Court could vacate the Fourth Circuit's judgment and remand for reconsideration in light of the government's new position. This is an efficient way to correct the error without a full review.\n    *   **Summary Reversal:** If the Court views the error as patent and a GVR as insufficient, it could summarily reverse the judgment without full briefing or argument. The SG's confession makes this a strong possibility.\n    *   **Denial of Certiorari:** The Court could still deny the petition, accepting the SG's arguments that the issue is rare and can be resolved through other means.\n    *   **Plenary Review:** The Court might still grant full review to issue a precedential opinion that definitively resolves the acknowledged circuit split for all future cases.\n\n*   **New Institutional Factor: The Rules Committee:** The SG's brief introduces a critical piece of non-case-specific evidence: the **Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has formed a subcommittee to study this exact issue**. The brief cites a September 2024 memorandum to the committee. This provides the Court with a strong justification for denying certiorari and allowing the rulemaking process, which is designed to handle such technical procedural matters, to resolve the split. This is the government's primary argument for why the Court should not intervene directly.\n\n*   **Reinforcement of Legal Arguments:** The SG's brief does not offer a substantive defense of the Fourth Circuit's decision. Instead, it agrees with the petitioner's reasoning, implicitly endorsing the view that a litigant's earlier notice of appeal can be validated by a subsequent order reopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6), consistent with the principles of *FirsTier*.\n\nIn sum, the SG's brief has transformed my prediction. The likelihood of the petitioner ultimately prevailing on the legal question has increased to near-certainty. However, the probability of a full grant with oral argument has decreased. The most likely outcomes are now a GVR or a summary reversal, as these actions would correct the clear error acknowledged by the government while being judicially efficient. The existence of the Rules Committee's review provides the Court a plausible \"off-ramp\" to deny cert, but a confession of error in the face of a deep circuit split often compels some form of corrective action from the Court.",

L. Rev. 797 The Paradox of Precedent About Precedent Volume 138 Issue 3 January 2025 See full issue Download See Footnotes When the Supreme Court overrules or declines to overrule a past decision, it typically invokes precedent about precedent.1 These are prior cases that establish a framework for when stare decisis counsels for or against overruling a decision.2 \u201cPerhaps the most famous\u201d3 of these is Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.4 Casey and its stare decisis factors have long been the dominant framework endorsed by the Court in constitutional cases.5 And even in cases in which the Court did not cite Casey, it employed a framework that mirrored the one Casey developed.6 But Casey is not alone as a precedent about stare decisis. Precedent about precedent exists to help judges (and litigants) deal with a host of stare decisis questions.7 This Note deals with precedent about precedent as a conceptual whole, but Casey and Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization8 make for ideal examples of the phenomenon on which this Note focuses. Without a doubt, Dobbs overruled aspects of Casey\u2019s framework even as it employed some of the factors that Casey laid out.9 Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey as precedent about precedent has drawn significant criticism, including in the pages of this law review.10 These critics argue that the Court\u2019s stare decisis analysis in Dobbs was misguided because it departed from Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis either in theory or in application.11 But if Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis was incorrect from the start, then the Dobbs majority would have erred by employing that same conception of stare decisis. The fact that Dobbs refused to invoke Casey\u2019s understanding of how stare decisis worked is not solely a function of the Court\u2019s rightward shift\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it is a function of precedent about precedent. This Note argues that precedent about precedent is unique within the system of stare decisis because precedent about precedent is not entitled to the stare decisis weight to which it, as precedent about precedent, would entitle all other cases. Part I further sketches out the notion of precedent about precedent and employs Dobbs and Casey as examples of precedent about precedent in practice. Part II then argues that precedent about precedent\u2019s unique status poses a paradox. Finally, Part III explores some of the problems that develop within any theory of precedent about precedent because of the implications that flow from its paradoxical nature. I.\u00a0\u00a0Precedent About Precedent This Part defines precedent about precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0what it is, and what it isn\u2019t. It then uses Dobbs and Casey to explore the idea of overruling precedent about precedent. A.\u00a0\u00a0The Concept of Precedent About Precedent \u201cPrecedent about precedent\u201d or \u201cprecedent on precedent\u201d is a \u201cprior opinion[] identifying whether and how [a court] will regard its past precedents.\u201d12 In other words, precedent about precedent is what establishes the framework through which a court evaluates horizontal precedent. Precedent about precedent tells future courts what factors to consider and how to weigh them as part of their stare decisis analysis.13 So, questions such as, \u201cWhat counts as a reliance interest?\u201d14 or even, \u201cShould the Court consider reliance interests?\u201d15 are all questions for which precedent about precedent provides an answer. Additionally, precedent about precedent needs to be one of two things: (1) an explicit holding about how to treat other precedents; or (2) otherwise controlling,16 either because some other precedent makes it so17 or because the Court treats it as such.18 Therefore, the individual views of Justices do not create precedent about precedent for the Court, but they can affect how precedent about precedent applies in practice.19 This idea of precedent about precedent is not foreign to the Court or scholarship surrounding stare decisis. For example, then-Judge Kavanaugh invoked the concept when discussing Casey at his confirmation hearing,20 and literature evaluating the Roberts Court\u2019s approach to stare decisis relies on the concept of precedent about precedent.21 There are concepts to which this Note does not use the term \u201cprecedent about precedent\u201d to refer. Importantly, precedent about precedent as this Note uses it does not implicate vertical precedent. To be sure, there is precedent about vertical precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0namely, that it binds lower courts.22 But as a general matter, each court that employs some form of horizontal precedent can choose its stare decisis framework for itself.23 Whether the Supreme Court could employ its supervisory power to impose a binding, vertical precedent about horizontal precedent is another question.24 For now, it is enough to acknowledge the Court has never attempted to do so.25 The precedent about precedent this Note is concerned with, therefore, is the horizontal precedent that describes how a court should evaluate its own precedents. Finally, it is important to mention that precedent about precedent can change over time. This Note is premised on the idea that the Court can and does overrule or change aspects of its precedent about precedent.26 That matters because it means sometimes the Court needs to employ some sort of framework to decide when to modify its precedent about precedent. And when that modification happens, one central question is: From where does the framework for reevaluating a precedent about precedent come? In other words, does the Court use the existing framework that it is supposed to be reconsidering, or does it employ what it believes to be a new, better framework?27 Answering these questions is key to understanding precedent about precedent more deeply. B.\u00a0\u00a0Casey and Dobbs: A Case Study Casey and Dobbs provide excellent examples of precedent about precedent in practice and the overruling of precedent about precedent. As a result, they can help one understand the theory behind precedent about precedent and how the Court evaluates precedent about precedent in practice. Of course, both Casey and Dobbs were and remain polarizing decisions,28 but it is in the abortion context that the contours of precedent about precedent become the sharpest.29 So, putting aside the merits of those decisions for a moment, it is possible to explore how precedent about precedent functions in practice. Start with what made Casey the Court\u2019s central \u201cpaean to stare decisis\u201d for so many years.30 Casey not only synthesized the prior factors the Court had employed into one, (relatively) clear stare decisis framework,31 but also painstakingly detailed how to apply those factors.32 In doing so, Casey became an authority moving forward for how the Court would think about stare decisis.33 Whether or not Casey\u2019s framework was actually binding on future decisions is another question,34 but what matters is that, for a time, when the Court was faced with overruling a prior case, it would dutifully wheel out Casey\u2019s framework and, at a minimum, purport to apply it.35 Thus, Casey was \u201cprecedent on precedent.\u201d36 Enter Dobbs. The Dobbs majority rejected Casey\u2019s framework in two meaningful respects. First, it overruled Casey\u2019s approach to reliance interests by rejecting Casey\u2019s intangible reliance interests analysis.37 Second, the majority discarded the weight Casey gave to the impact of overruling Roe on the Court\u2019s legitimacy by focusing on Roe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s political divisiveness.38 In doing so, however, the Court did not use Casey\u2019s analysis to determine whether Casey\u2019s analysis should be overruled. If the Court had done so, Casey would have survived because overruling Casey\u2019s understanding of intangible reliance interests would have, for example, itself undermined intangible reliance interests.39 Instead, Dobbs employed what it viewed as the proper stare decisis framework and evaluated Casey in light of that conception of stare decisis.40 In overruling Casey as a precedent about precedent, Dobbs did not treat Casey\u2019s precedent about precedent as controlling. In sum, precedent about precedent tells future Courts how to evaluate precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the weight to give to reliance interests, how wrong the prior decision needs to be to overrule it, and so forth. But sometimes the Court overrules a prior precedent about precedent, as it did in Dobbs. In deciding whether to overrule the Casey framework, the Court did not employ the Casey framework. That decision is the central focus of this Note, which now turns to the paradox that necessitates that decision. II.\u00a0\u00a0The Paradox As the discussion of Dobbs and Casey suggests, precedent about precedent faces a unique wrinkle when it comes to stare decisis. This Part offers a theoretical explanation for this unique status by suggesting that precedent about precedent is paradoxical in nature. It then explores this paradox in practice by returning to Dobbs and some of the criticisms of Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey as a precedent about precedent. A.\u00a0\u00a0Theory The paradox of precedent about precedent is this: When the Court overrules a precedent about precedent, it cannot employ that precedent about precedent to evaluate the original precedent itself. As a result, precedent about precedent entitles all other cases to a certain amount of stare decisis weight before they are overruled, but the same stare decisis weight does not attach to the precedent about precedent when it faces its own repudiation. Unlike all other cases, precedent about precedent does not operate under the very rules the precedent establishes. A real-world example at the extreme demonstrates the underlying theory of why a precedent about precedent cannot be evaluated on its own terms. For a roughly sixty-eight year stretch, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom considered stare decisis absolute41 until it overruled that practice.42 In other words, the House of Lords\u2019 precedent about precedent did not permit it to ever overrule a precedent,43 but it nevertheless did so without feeling constrained by that precedent about precedent.44 If the Supreme Court were to adopt that approach and then later decide that such an approach was misguided, surely it could overrule its absolutist position, just as the House of Lords did, even though the absolutist approach to stare decisis would suggest that it could never itself be overruled. An alternative view would mean that the House of Lords acted illegitimately when it overruled its own absolutist meta-precedent, but there are a couple of problems with that view. First, such a position would raise serious questions about the ability of one majority to truly bind a future majority to a particular framework.45 A judge-made rule that could not be amended is like a statute that purports to be unamendable by Congress. So long as the source of the law is the same, there is no reason why a subsequent rule cannot replace a prior one.46 Second, such a position would present opportunities for gamesmanship.47 Therefore, the experience of the House of Lords demonstrates why it would be theoretically untenable to suggest that a precedent about precedent applies to itself. A simplified, numerical example helps illustrate this point for nonabsolute rules of meta-precedent. Imagine that the Court\u2019s existing framework for stare decisis established in Case A required the majority to be at least 90% certain that a prior case was wrongly decided before overruling that case.48 Now imagine that in Case B the Court has come to believe that its 90% bar was too high. Instead, the Court would like to use Case B as a vehicle to establish a new stare decisis framework. Under Case B\u2019s proposed rule, the Court could overrule a case when it is 75% certain the prior case was wrongly decided. Obviously, doing so would require overruling Case A as precedent about precedent. But here\u2019s the catch: Can the Court overrule Case A if it is only 80% sure Case A was wrongly decided? The answer should be \u201cyes\u201d for the same reason that the House of Lords could overrule its absolutist stare decisis position. If the House of Lords could overrule an absolutist rule without employing the absolutist rule, then Case B can overrule Case A without employing Case A\u2019s rule. Therefore, the old Case A\u2019s 90% framework will be subjected to Case B\u2019s new 75% framework instead of Case A\u2019s own framework. If Case B were merely overruling a run-of-the-mill merits decision in Case C, Case B would be bound by the normal rules of stare decisis to apply Case A\u2019s 90% framework. But because Case B is overruling a precedent about precedent, Case A does not receive the same stare decisis consideration that Case C would. That makes Case A, as a precedent about precedent, unique among other cases when it comes to stare decisis. Therein lies the heart of the paradox. A precedent about precedent is not entitled to the same stare decisis weight as all other precedent despite establishing how much stare decisis weight other precedents are to be given. Requiring the Court to employ the stare decisis framework that it views as incorrect to evaluate whether stare decisis compels it to retain that very framework would be both illogical and impractical. It would mean that one Court could set the rules of precedent about precedent for all time, a position that eschews traditional approaches to stare decisis. It would also mean that a Court could create special rules for favored cases, undermining the evenhanded application of stare decisis. Therefore, when asking whether Case B must use Case A\u2019s stare decisis framework to overrule Case A\u2019s framework, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d It is this inability to operate within the very framework that it establishes and that all other cases operate within that makes precedent about precedent unique. B.\u00a0\u00a0Practice In practice, this means that when the Court overrules aspects of its precedent about precedent, such as Casey, it cannot and will not use that precedent about precedent\u2019s framework. The theory behind the paradox of precedent about precedent means that a precedent about precedent should not be used to evaluate itself. This plays out in numerous cases involving revisions to precedent about precedent. Dobbs is a prime example,49 but there are others. Casey itself, in synthesizing a new stare decisis framework, did not purport to apply any particular prior framework.50 The Ramos v. Louisiana51 plurality, in attempting to overrule part of the Marks v. United States52 rule, did not first apply Marks; instead, it claimed Marks did not cover situations like the one in Ramos.53 Therefore, in some respects, the critics of the Dobbs majority have a point. Dobbs discarded or modified aspects of Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis without analyzing the Casey framework through any sort of stare decisis lens.54 But it is important to differentiate two different lines of criticism surrounding Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey. First, there is a \u201cmerits\u201d claim. This is simply the claim that as a matter of stare decisis\u00a0\u2014\u00a0regardless of the framework\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Casey should not have been overruled.55 Fair enough. It is the second line of criticism that matters for this Note\u2019s purposes. This is the \u201cmeta-precedent\u201d claim, meaning that it involves precedent about precedent. This criticism argues that Dobbs should have upheld Casey based on Casey\u2019s own stare decisis framework.56 The paradox of precedent about precedent demonstrates that this claim cannot be true. For one, it would create a theoretical mess. For another, practice surrounding precedent about precedent confirms that when Justices overrule (or attempt to modify) aspects of precedent about precedent, they do not apply the original precedent about precedent.57 In fairness, the lines often blur between the merits and meta-precedent arguments.58 When someone thinks that the original precedent about precedent was correct, he or she is likely to believe that a new stare decisis framework should not be applied because the old framework was correct on the merits.59 Again, nothing about the paradox of precedent about precedent suggests that the merits claim is illegitimate. When that claim becomes blurred with a meta-precedent claim, however, the criticism\u2019s footing becomes shakier. In other words, arguments that Dobbs should not have overruled Casey based on Dobbs\u2019s own conception of stare decisis60 are fair game. So too are arguments that Dobbs misconceived vital aspects of stare decisis.61 What the nature of precedent about precedent prevents is arguments that Dobbs erred by not applying Casey\u2019s formulation of stare decisis. In short then, precedent about precedent\u2019s unique paradoxical nature prevents it from applying to itself. What exists in theory plays itself out in practice, as Dobbs (and Ramos) demonstrate. But this paradox is only the beginning. The strange nature of precedent about precedent gives rise to other theoretical problems\u00a0\u2014\u00a0problems that the Court has not reasoned through. III.\u00a0\u00a0The Problems This paradox that precedent about precedent creates presents a host of problems. This Part examines those problems and offers a preliminary account of how judges and scholars ought to think about them. It also shines light on an area of law the Court too often neglects to theorize adequately. A.\u00a0\u00a0The Problem of Overruling Precedent About Precedent The first problem that this theory of precedent about precedent presents is what to do about overruling precedent about precedent. Previously, this Note has focused on the theory behind overruling a precedent about precedent in order to lower the bar for overruling cases. But the problem of overruling precedent about precedent exists in both directions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0making it easier to overrule precedent and making it harder. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Lowering the Bar for Overruling.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The first problem with overruling precedent about precedent occurs whenever the Court makes it easier to overrule precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in other words, when the Court lowers the bar for overruling prior cases by modifying the prior precedent about precedent. For most cases, this is relatively straightforward. When the Court weakens or overrules a real-world stare decisis factor, it employs the new calculus to overrule the prior precedent about precedent.62 This is the key insight of recognizing that precedent about precedent presents a paradox. Dobbs is once again a prime example of this. In rejecting Casey\u2019s judicial-legitimacy justification for retaining Roe,63 the Court focused on Roe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s disruption of democratic deliberation around the abortion question.64 It did not employ Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis. Many of the factors it invoked were the same,65 but Dobbs used its own stare decisis calculus to decide whether Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis was correct.66 To the extent that one thinks this approach to stare decisis in the precedent about precedent context is problematic, it is largely inescapable. An alternative solution is simply not feasible for logical and practical reasons.67 There is a larger problem looming, however. So far, this Note has assumed that Case A (requiring 90% certainty) meets Case B\u2019s criteria for overruling (requiring 75%). But what happens if Case A comes up short? This would occur if the Court was only 70% certain that Case A was wrong. Is Case A as a precedent about precedent entitled to any stare decisis respect? In these instances, precedent about precedent presents the problem that this Note has only so far hinted at\u00a0\u2014\u00a0can one Court bind a future Court methodologically?68 In practice, the Court seems not to bother with stare decisis when it modifies precedent about precedent. For example, rather than determine whether Casey\u2019s conception of reliance was workable, had itself engendered reliance interests, and so forth, the Dobbs Court made a merits judgment that Casey was wrong about reliance, and then it overruled Casey on that point.69 This suggests that stare decisis for precedent about precedent is empty (or so extremely merits sensitive that it overrides any other considerations).70 In other words, the Court makes a merits decision about what the correct rule of precedent is, and then it implements that rule regardless of whether the old precedent about precedent meets the new criteria for overruling. So if the Court is only 70% sure Case A was wrong, it still overrules Case A and adopts a 75% threshold in Case B. The Court does not in practice apply the new stare decisis framework to the old one. This is both a problem and a potential solution. On the one hand, it undermines the idea of precedent about precedent as binding in practice. And if precedent about precedent isn\u2019t binding, why do judicial nominees profess fidelity to it,71 and what good is it? So that is a problem. On the other hand, if precedent about precedent does not get any stare decisis effect, then there is a way to explain the Court\u2019s practice of seemingly ignoring stare decisis when it comes to precedent about precedent: The Court does not bother going through the stare decisis factors when overruling precedent about precedent because it is a purely merits-motivated decision. A couple of implications flow from this position. First, the Court and judicial nominees can still claim that they are bound by precedent about precedent in almost all cases.72 Overruling precedent about precedent is a special case where precedent about precedent does not apply. This understanding of precedent about precedent comports with the theoretical point from earlier that precedent about precedent does not apply to itself.73 It also allows one to retain the view that precedent about precedent is constraining to some degree.74 It is just not constraining when it comes to itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0hence, the paradox. Recognizing that overruling precedent about precedent is a purely merits-based decision also solves the problem of what to do when Case B wants to overrule Case A as precedent about precedent, but Case A does not meet Case B\u2019s criteria for overruling. Because the decision to overrule Case A as precedent about precedent is a pure merits question, it does not matter if Case A satisfies Case B\u2019s framework.75 Finally, from a positivist perspective, it seems to provide a descriptively correct account of the law. If one accepts the view that the Court can create binding precedent about precedent, understanding the paradox of precedent about precedent in this way helps explain behaviors in some of the Court\u2019s most recent cases involving precedent about precedent.76 To be sure, viewing precedent about precedent as binding except when its own framework is at issue is not the only possible solution to this problem. Another solution is to reject the idea that one Court can methodologically bind future Courts. This would do away with precedent about precedent as a concept. On the one hand, this might be a compelling solution because there are certainly some situations in which it seems the Court cannot methodologically bind itself.77 However, adopting this view runs into a couple of problems. First, it would not explain why the Court talks about precedent about precedent in the way it does. If precedent about precedent is not binding in cases where the precedent itself is at issue, why does the Court repeatedly suggest that precedent about precedent matters?78 Second, there are instances in which the Court does adopt binding methodologies.79 Perhaps this is incorrect,80 or precedent about precedent can be differentiated from these situations,81 but at the very least, discarding the idea of precedent about precedent is a drastic step. A final, related solution would be to view precedent about precedent as permissive but not mandatory in all cases. This would make precedent about precedent a special case of the view that Professor Richard Re has outlined.82 Following Re\u2019s approach, the Court could invoke precedent about precedent to \u201cestablish[] the lawfulness of a particular course of action without requiring any additional inquiry,\u201d but \u201c[i]t would remain fully open to the judge to deviate from the precedent, provided that doing so is otherwise lawful.\u201d83 In other words, it is lawful for the Court to retain precedent about precedent because it is precedent, but it is also lawful for the Court to choose to ignore or revoke the permission that precedent about precedent bestows.84 On the descriptive side, the precedent about precedent permission model avoids reading too much into the Court\u2019s statements that precedent about precedent has some binding force; while the Court may proclaim that precedent about precedent is binding, \u201cthe Justices may help themselves to a rhetoric of bindingness while engaging in a practice that is best described in terms of permissions.\u201d85 Thus, the permission model describes the Court\u2019s practices in a \u201cdo-as-I-do,\u201d not in a \u201cdo-as-I-say,\u201d manner, which is a less drastic step than discarding the concept of precedent about precedent in toto, but it still requires one to discount significantly the purported constraint of precedent about precedent. Thus, whenever the Court makes it easier to overrule precedent about precedent, there is a chance that a theoretical problem will present itself. However, there are a couple of ways to reconceptualize precedent about precedent in order to get around this problem, depending on one\u2019s view of whether one majority can methodologically bind a future majority. Each potential solution has its merits and drawbacks. The point here is not to definitively defend one solution but to demonstrate that the paradoxical nature of precedent about precedent requires more theorization about precedent and its constraining power\u00a0\u2014\u00a0theorization at which the Justices have only waved their hands.86 2.\u00a0\u00a0Raising the Bar for Overruling.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When the Court raises the bar for overruling precedent, it triggers the second problem with overruling precedent about precedent. This problem is more complex than the problem that arises from lowering the bar for overruling precedent, but it again serves the point of highlighting the paradoxical nature of precedent about precedent. The issue imagined here is reversal of the prior examples; instead of establishing a 75% threshold for overruling a case (call that Case X), the Court wants to establish a 90% certainty requirement (call that Case Y). If the Court is 95% confident that Case X is wrong as a precedent about precedent, then there is no problem at all because the Court\u2019s decision satisfies both Case X\u2019s and Case Y\u2019s requirements. The difficulty arises when the Court is only 80% sure Case X is wrong. In that instance, Case X should be overruled on its own terms, but Case Y, which is supposed to be the new stare decisis framework, suggests that overruling would be inappropriate. The Marks rule is instructive. Imagine if a plurality of the Court were to adopt the view that Marks should be abandoned so that only a majority opinion created binding precedent,87 and a fifth Justice whose vote was necessary to create a judgment in the case adopted the position that Marks was never actually binding law because it was an interpretive methodology for precedents like Auer88 deference is for regulations.89 Under Marks, the plurality position would be binding as the \u201cnarrowest grounds\u201d of agreement.90 But the plurality position would be that Marks is overruled and only a true majority position is binding. In other words, following Marks\u2019s own rule, Marks would be overruled, but following the precedent that the Marks rule purports to establish via the plurality opinion, Marks would not be overruled. Granted, such a situation would probably be a rarity. Ramos, however, came close to exemplifying this problem. There, a plurality claimed that Apodaca v. Oregon91 provided no binding precedent under the Marks rule because Justice Powell\u2019s separate opinion, which was necessary to create a judgment of the Court, would have overruled prior precedent92\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a position which the other eight Justices in Apodaca rejected.93 Therefore, the Ramos plurality would have adopted a rule of precedent about precedent that the Marks rule does not create binding precedent when the controlling opinion \u201crepudiate[s] this Court\u2019s repeated pre-existing teachings on\u201d an area of law.94 In other words, the plurality would have modified the Marks rule to ensure \u201ca single Justice writing only for himself\u201d does not have \u201cthe authority to bind this Court to propositions it has already rejected.\u201d95 To be sure, the plurality did not view this as a partial repudiation of the Marks rule\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but the other six Justices did.96 So, taking the plurality\u2019s approach as an attempt to overrule Marks in part,97 it is interesting that Justice Gorsuch did not acknowledge the awkwardness of his position.98 The plurality\u2019s position was that a mere plurality could not\u00a0\u2014\u00a0consistent with Marks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0overrule settled precedent. Yet, the lead opinion in Ramos was a plurality attempting to overrule what the other Justices took as a settled application of Marks.99 Assume for a minute that Justice Gorsuch\u2019s position was the narrowest one in Ramos concerning Marks.100 Under Marks, the view that a plurality opinion cannot overrule prior precedent therefore would be controlling.101 But under the Ramos plurality\u2019s view that the Marks rule now says is controlling, a plurality opinion that overrules prior precedent cannot be controlling.102 By attempting to raise the bar for overruling precedent, the Ramos plurality has ensured that its own rule is invalid.103 The point is that the nature of precedent about precedent creates this paradoxical situation that makes one\u2019s head hurt if thought about for too long. As a result, there needs to be a way out of this problem. Fortunately, the solutions from before can help. If the decision to raise the bar for overruling\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just like the decision to lower the bar\u00a0\u2014 is truly a merits question without any consideration for stare decisis, then it does not matter if Case X does not meet Case Y\u2019s new criteria for overruling. Case Y can simply replace Case X\u2019s framework based on a merits judgment that Case X was wrong. And if stare decisis does not attach to precedent about precedent, then it is possible to avoid the Marks/Ramos-plurality problem. It does not matter whether the Ramos plurality\u2019s view of Marks is precedential or not because the Court in a future case can always resolve the question anew based on its own view of the merits.104 The same implication holds if the Court cannot methodologically bind itself; neither Marks nor the Ramos plurality\u2019s revision of Marks affects future Courts from a precedent about precedent perspective. The Court is entitled to determine whether a prior fractured case is entitled to stare decisis based on its own views. It is not bound by Marks or any other rule. Finally, if precedent about precedent is permissive, then the Ramos plurality could have lawfully followed Marks, but it did not have to do so.105 Likewise, in the future, the Court can continue to treat Marks as permissive precedent about precedent,106 or it can reevaluate its rules for fractured decisions.107 At bottom, if precedent about precedent does not apply to itself and overruling it does not trigger stare decisis considerations, judges and scholars can avoid some of the problems that the paradox of precedent about precedent seems to present. This is just one possible way of conceptualizing the unique status of precedent about precedent, but it has the benefit of making meta-precedent still a worthwhile inquiry for all other cases. The other conceptualizations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0rejecting methodological binding and viewing precedent as permission\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are also viable. Right now, however, the Court is not thinking hard about the status of precedent about precedent or its implications. B.\u00a0\u00a0The Problem of Individual Approaches to Precedent About Precedent The paradox also affects individual Justices\u2019 approaches to precedent about precedent. Yet this phenomenon too goes unrealized in the Court\u2019s current writings on precedent. Earlier, precedent about precedent was defined as, at a minimum, something a majority of the Court viewed as binding.108 That means that idiosyncratic views, such as Justice Thomas\u2019s, do not count as precedent about precedent no matter how many times they are reiterated in concurrences. But what happens when members of the Court do not follow the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent?109 Or worse yet, what if a panel on the court of appeals believes that the circuit\u2019s horizontal precedent rules, which were adopted as Circuit Rules, are unconstitutional?110 Precedent about precedent does not really matter if individual Justices or judges do not follow it.111 This section discusses the problems that individualized approaches to stare decisis create. The preeminent example of the problem of an individual rejection of precedent about precedent is Justice Thomas\u2019s approach in Gamble v. United States.112 There, Justice Thomas outlined a different stare decisis approach that focused on the nature of the prior decision\u2019s error.113 Justice Thomas argued that the Court can adhere to incorrect prior decisions so long as they are not \u201cdemonstrably erroneous,\u201d but that judges are not bound by wrongly decided precedent regardless of the precedent\u2019s workability or reliance interests.114 Justice Thomas\u2019s view, then, looks very similar to the precedent as permission view (although with mandatory overruling of demonstrably erroneous precedents).115 His view certainly does not follow the Court\u2019s precedents about stare decisis.116 Voting based on a different stare decisis analysis weakens precedent about precedent overall because even if precedent about precedent is not binding on itself, the Court\u2019s rhetoric treats it as binding when applied to other cases.117 But if one or more Justices take a different approach than the majority does about the proper standard for stare decisis, the bindingness of precedent about precedent is watered down. Imagine if the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent required a case to meet factors A, B, and C to warrant overruling. In a particular case, four Justices believe a prior case has met all three factors, four Justices believe the prior case has met none, and the final Justice believes the case has met factor A. Should the prior case be overruled? In the abstract sense, the answer should be \u201cno\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0five Justices have decided that the three factors necessary for overruling have not been met. But if the ninth Justice believes that only factor A should be necessary for overruling, then the Court will overrule the prior case because a majority of the Court thinks the case should be overruled, even though a majority does not think that the case satisfies the criteria that the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent outlines. Thus, one arrives at a result that seems problematic if precedent about precedent is taken seriously. But Justice Thomas is not alone. There is also the phenomenon of the \u201cperpetual dissent.\u201d118 This is the practice of individual Justices continuing to author \u201copinions that reiterate a past dissenting view and then offer a rationale different from the majority\u2019s (either to concur or dissent)\u201d because the \u201cJustice refuses to accept the rule of a prior decision .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0as controlling authority.\u201d119 The most famous of these is Justices Brennan\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s standard practice of dissenting from the constitutionality of the death penalty,120 but the practice exists in multiple areas of law across judicial ideology.121 Interestingly, when Justices engage in perpetual dissent, they typically do not employ the Court\u2019s stare decisis framework; instead, they focus on reiterating their view that the prior case or line of cases was wrongly decided on the merits.122 That suggests that when Justices engage in perpetual dissent, they are ignoring the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent and focusing solely on the merits. Again, this waters down the practical effect of precedent about precedent. \u201cPrecedent about precedent is usually binding,\u201d the perpetual dissenters seem to say, \u201cbut not when it comes to this issue about which I really care.\u201d123 This rejection of precedent about precedent, either as a whole framework (in the case of Justice Thomas) or in specific applications (in the case of some perpetual dissenters), is possible because precedent about precedent is not binding on itself. Therefore, individual Justices can make a merits decision that they will not adhere to the Court\u2019s precedents about precedent in certain contexts without worrying about any other stare decisis considerations.124 Thus, it seems that the paradox of precedent about precedent shapes judicial behavior by allowing for these individualized approaches. However, the earlier discussion of potential solutions to the problem of overruling precedent about precedent suggested that even if precedent about precedent is not binding on itself, there is value in seeing it as binding for all other cases.125 In other words, Casey was not binding when determining whether to overrule Casey as precedent about precedent, but it was binding when deciding whether to overrule other decisions.126 When individual Justices take a different approach, however, it looks like precedent about precedent is not binding even when applied to other cases. There are a couple of possible solutions to this quandary as well. One possibility is to write off these individual views as illegitimate\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an example of Justices \u201celevating [their] individual jurisprudence\u201d above the Court\u2019s own doctrine.127 From a purely theoretical standpoint, this position has appeal. It fits with the view that precedent about precedent is constraining at least when applied to other cases, even if not when applied to itself. When Justices ignore precedent about precedent in favor of their own views, they devalue the constraining force of precedent about precedent and thereby weaken the value of precedent as a whole.128 From a practical standpoint, however, this view cannot explain why Justices continue to vote according to their own views on precedent rather than the Court\u2019s.129 It also ignores the fact that there is no disciplining method for Justices who refuse to follow the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent.130 Thus, this view fits well with some of the theoretical arguments from before, but it may suffer in its description of actual practice. That leads to the nonbinding view of precedent about precedent again. If precedent about precedent is not constraining on the Justices either because the Court cannot methodologically bind its members or because precedent about precedent is merely permissive, then individual Justices can legitimately refuse to follow precedent about precedent in favor of their own views.131 This view can, therefore, explain why Justices continue to favor personal precedent over institutional precedent about precedent,132 but it does not explain why individual Justices also continue to invoke the idea that the Court as a whole must adhere to its precedent about precedent.133 To summarize, the paradox of precedent about precedent spills over into individual approaches to precedent about precedent. There are different ways of thinking about these individual approaches, each of which offers its own set of justifications. Those approaches each present their own weakness as well. In the status quo, however, the Court and individual Justices neglect to think about these problems when they discuss precedent about precedent. Conclusion Precedent about precedent presents a paradox that gives it a unique status within our system of stare decisis because a court overruling precedent about precedent will not apply the stare decisis framework that the precedent about precedent established. Dobbs is a recent example of this phenomenon, but many critics of Dobbs have faulted the Court for not applying Casey\u2019s stare decisis framework even as Dobbs overruled Casey as precedent about precedent. These critiques make little sense in light of the unique nature of precedent about precedent. Of course, that unique nature creates issues that the Court too often ignores. In particular, the paradox of precedent about precedent raises difficult questions about whether one Court can bind a future Court to a particular stare decisis framework and about the binding nature of precedent itself. This is an especially pressing problem on a Court deeply divided about the weight and value of stare decisis.134 It also demonstrates the difficulty that individual views about precedent create for a coherent system of precedent about precedent. This Note does not purport to resolve all of these problems, but it offers some preliminary answers. More than that, however, it is a call to future Courts and scholars to think more seriously about the concept of precedent about precedent. Footnotes Hide show ^ See, e.g., Kimble v.

Judicial Interpretation When Does the U.S. Supreme Court Review State Court Decisions? State courts have the final word on state law, but when federal law is involved, it can be complicated. By Sarah Kessler Published: September 30, 2024 National National Next week marks the start of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s new term. As usual, some of the appeals on the Court\u2019s docket will come from state courts of last resort. When can the Supreme Court weigh in on an issue already decided by a state\u2019s highest court? The answer is not straightforward. Since the country\u2019s founding, state courts have had the final say on questions of state law. But they share responsibility with federal courts for interpreting and applying federal law. As a result, competing concerns \u2014 ensuring that state courts correctly and consistently apply federal law and respecting their autonomy \u2014 have led to a complex set of rules for when the Supreme Court takes appeals from the state courts. The rules stem both from federal legislation and the Supreme Court\u2019s own interpretive guidance, developed in centuries of opinions. General rule The Constitution provides a high-level foundation for the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals directly from state courts, allowing for review of state decisions involving issues related to federal statutes, treaties, or constitutional law. Congress elaborated on the specifics in the Judiciary Act of 1789, which it has repeatedly updated over time. As a general matter, today\u2019s version provides that the Supreme Court may review appeals from \u201cfinal judgments\u201d issued \u201cby the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\u201d that raise a question under the same three areas of federal law. This statute applies to both civil and criminal appeals. The \u201chighest court of a State\u201d usually means the state\u2019s supreme court, but an appeal from a lower court can qualify if the appealing party has exhausted all available appellate options within the state system. For example, the Supreme Court has accepted review from intermediate courts where the state high court\u2019s denial of a request to appeal barred further state review or where state procedural rules gave no additional right to appeal within the state. Similarly, the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule typically requires a case to be fully resolved in the state courts, not subject to ongoing proceedings. The Supreme Court has counted as \u201cfinal judgments,\u201d however, certain circumstances where the federal issue has been finally decided, but other aspects of the case are still in progress. In particular, the Court may hear a state appeal where the federal issue would survive and require a decision regardless of the outcome of the other parts, would be precluded from review at a later point (such as because the issue will be mooted), \u201cmight seriously erode federal policy\u201d if not immediately reviewed, or where resolution of the federal issue would conclude the remaining proceedings. Adequate and independent state grounds Appeals from state courts frequently involve both state law and federal law questions. If the decision below rested on an \u201cadequate and independent state ground,\u201d the Supreme Court may not review it. The Supreme Court has interpreted its jurisdiction this way to avoid issuing advisory opinions \u2014 judicial guidance offered when an actual case is not at stake \u2014 in violation of a separate jurisdictional bar the Court has recognized since its founding. If the state court would reach the same result based on state law in any event, weighing in on the federal issue would be purely advisory, the reasoning goes. What counts as an \u201cadequate and independent state ground\u201d for a state court decision? The Supreme Court makes that determination itself and has provided longstanding guidance. To be \u201cadequate,\u201d the state basis must have \u201cfair support\u201d or, put another way, not be \u201cplainly untenable.\u201d The basis also must be broad enough on its own to sustain the judgment. An \u201cindependent\u201d state basis is not dependent on, or \u201cinterwoven with,\u201d federal law. For example, it\u2019s not enough for a state court to cite state cases as support for its ruling, if those state cases are themselves applications of federal law. Similarly, \u201cwhere a state court has \u2018felt compelled by what it understood to be federal constitutional considerations to construe and apply its own law in the manner it did,\u2019\u201d the Supreme Court has said that does not qualify. In practice, this rule means that a state court decision that interprets the state\u2019s constitution in \u201clockstep\u201d \u2014 or in adherence \u2014 with the federal Constitution may be more vulnerable to Supreme Court review. Even with the Court\u2019s longstanding guidance, determining whether a state decision is based on an adequate and independent state ground is not always clear-cut. The Supreme Court in Michigan v. Long introduced an approach to resolving that ambiguity that the Court has used for the last forty years. When a state ruling \u201cfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law,\u201d the Court will assume there is no adequate and independent state ground, unless the state court made a \u201cplain statement\u201d clearly indicating otherwise. Some justices have criticized this presumption as making it harder for states freely to develop their own laws. Under the framework, a state court would have to anticipate that references to federal law could be viewed as ambiguous by the Court and so would trigger the requirement expressly to convey that the decision rests on an adequate and independent state ground. Nonetheless, a majority of the Court has followed the \u201cplain statement\u201d approach in most ambiguous cases since Long. On occasion, however, where there was \u201cconsiderable uncertainty as to the precise grounds\u201d for the state decision or the state court did not issue an opinion, the Court has vacated the decision and remanded to the state court for clarification. State procedural rules Sometimes a state court rejects a federal claim based on a state procedural rule \u2014 for example, it may rule the claim was untimely or waived \u2014 rather than considering the substance of the claim. A procedural rule may also serve as an adequate and independent state ground that precludes Supreme Court review of the federal question. In deciding whether a state procedural rule is an \u201cadequate\u201d ground, the Supreme Court generally has focused on consistency of application. A state procedural rule typically qualifies if it is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed\u201d and has been applied neutrally, not in a way that avoids or \u201coperates to the particular disadvantage\u201d of federal claims. These criteria, the Court has indicated, are intended to protect claimants\u2019 procedural due process rights and the supremacy of federal law. In line with those concerns, the Court has recognized rare circumstances where the application of even a \u201cgenerally sound\u201d procedural rule \u201crenders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d These \u201cexceptional\u201d cases have included applications that are \u201cnovel\u201d or \u201cabruptly depart\u201d from prior interpretations, or where the claimant\u2019s compliance with the rule, although not perfect, is \u201csufficient\u201d to serve the state\u2019s procedural interest. They also have tended to involve more consequential federal claims, asserting constitutional rights. New federal question Occasionally, a party believes the highest state court\u2019s decision raises a new federal question. Will the Supreme Court review the case even though that issue was not asserted below? The general rule is no. Out of respect for state courts and desire for a developed appellate record, the Court ordinarily requires a federal claim to have been addressed by, or presented to, the state court whose decision is being appealed, although a party\u2019s arguments in support of that claim can vary. While the Court\u2019s recent rulings have tended to treat this requirement as prudential \u2014 or excusable under the circumstances of particular cases \u2014 earlier decisions viewed it as jurisdictional, and the question has never actually been settled by the Court. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The adequate and independent state ground doctrine provides an incentive for state courts to develop and apply state constitutional law distinctly from federal law. In the event a losing party appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court a decision based on state law that clearly and expressly departs from federal law, the Supreme Court should decline and the state court should have the last word on the issue.

Idaho Law Foundation Home / Blog Digital Advocate Precedent Predicaments February 1, 2023 by Lindsey Welfley By John E. Cutler Within our adversary system, the judicial branch resolves cases based on evidence and arguments presented by opposing parties.[i] As a general matter, courts do not look beyond the parties\u2019 arguments to determine whether there might be other issues or arguments that could have been raised for or against a matter presented for decision.[ii] This dynamic results in appellate decisions that are focused on resolving the dispute between the parties, without a plenary discussion of all potential issues or applications of the various statutes, regulations, common law principles, or public policies potentially at issue. Given the narrow, dispute-resolution focus fostered by our adversary system, it is not uncommon for an appellate decision to include a phrase or sentence that is inconsequential to the matter at hand but dispositive in another legal context. At other times, the parties\u2019 failure to fully address an issue may cause an appellate court to resolve that issue briefly and without substantial analysis. This article aims to help lawyers in dealing with such precedent predicaments. These byproducts of the adversary system can present a predicament for lawyers and judges in later cases: precedent. Although the adversary system requires resolution of cases on the record presented, the rule of vertical stare decisis means that published appellate decisions are treated as binding precedent for lower courts. Whether language in an appellate opinion was central to the decision or only an afterthought, zealous advocates are sure to latch onto every word in a published opinion to deploy it in support of arguments on behalf of their clients.[iii] Likewise, lower courts will strive to be faithful to precedent by giving legal effect to language in appellate decisions, whether addressed in a single sentence or a lengthy discussion. The result of this predicament may later cause the Supreme Court to \u201creframe the central issue\u201d in the case before it.[iv] As the Court explained in Allen v. Campbell, it was \u201cunderstandable that the parties and the district court treated [the statute] as bearing on subject matter jurisdiction because this Court essentially said so forty years ago. . . . But a close reading of [our earlier decision] reveals that we misspoke . . . .\u201d[v] It can be hard to know whether an appellate court \u201cmisspoke,\u201d but lawyers have at least a few options when they suspect a line from a decision was not intended to govern the issues presented in their case. Dicta? The first question to answer when evaluating language from an appellate decision is whether the language is \u201cdictum and not controlling.\u201d[vi] When a \u201cstatement\u201d in an appellate decision was \u201cnot necessary to decide the issue presented to the appellate court,\u201d the statement is dictum.[vii] Establishing that unfavorable language was dicta should be the first line of defense when presented with a statement from an appellate decision that is adverse to a client\u2019s interest. But lawyers would do well not to stop there. Dictum is like an idea previously planted in the court\u2019s awareness that may become controlling if a court later finds it persuasive.[viii] Thus, the tools for dealing with what appears to be an adverse precedent are also relevant in addressing adverse dicta. Practice Ideas for When You Suspect the Appellate Court \u201cMisspoke\u201d In some cases, a statement in an appellate decision cannot easily be written off as dictum. For example, in Matter of Estate of Smith, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected a party\u2019s request for attorney fees under \u201cthe Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act\u201d (\u201cTEDRA\u201d), Idaho Code Sections 15-8-101 to 15-8-305.[ix] The Court\u2019s brief analysis of the issue follows: [TEDRA] permits the court to award costs and fees from any party, assets of the estate or trust, or nonprobate asset that is subject of the proceedings. I.C. \u00a7 15-8-208(1); Quemada v. Arizmendez, 153 Idaho 609, 617, 288 P.3d 826, 834 (2012). Unlike in Quemada, Joseph did not file his initial petition for probate pursuant to TEDRA, Idaho Code section 15-3-302. As such, this was not a TEDRA proceeding and its costs and fees provision does not have applicability here.[x] The statement that failure to \u201cfile [the] initial petition for probate pursuant to TEDRA\u201d renders the case \u201cnot a TEDRA proceeding\u201d appears to be necessary to the Court\u2019s decision denying an award of TEDRA fees and costs.[xi] On the other hand, the brevity of the analysis prompts a question of the intended scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on this issue. Using Matter of Smith as an example, the remainder of this article addresses three areas of inquiry for counsel faced with a short statement in an appellate case that appears controlling at first blush. 1. Evaluate Consistency with Other Law The first area of inquiry when confronting stray language in an opinion that appears to control an issue, is to investigate whether there are other lines of conflicting authority in statute, regulations, or cases. Demonstrating to a court that a brief unfavorable statement from one opinion conflicts with the plain language of a statute or a long line of thoroughly reasoned analysis in another line of cases can go a long way. Courts do not hide elephants in mouseholes. Although an appellate court\u2019s statement may appear unequivocal and necessary to a decision, if that statement is not accompanied by any reasoning distinguishing it from a prior line of cases or the clear text of the statute, there is a good argument to preclude application of that statement to other cases. As an example of this, the TEDRA pleading requirement embraced in the terse holding in Matter of Smith, appears to conflict with the language of Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(4)(A) providing that it is \u201cnot necessary for any party in a civil action to assert a claim for attorney fees in any pleading\u201d other than a default judgment.[xii] Similarly, in Straub v. Smith,[xiii] the Idaho Supreme Court held that because a case did \u201cnot involve a default judgment . . . to require that attorney fees be pleaded in this case would be contrary to I.R.C.P. 54(e)(4).\u201d Finally, the text of TEDRA contains no express pleading requirement and instead includes text indicating that it \u201cshall not be construed as being limited by any other specific statutory provision providing for the payment of costs, unless such statute specifically provides otherwise.\u201d[xiv] In other words, the rules of civil procedure, existing precedent on attorney fees, and the text of TEDRA itself all suggest that a party is not required to specifically invoke the statute in a pleading as a precursor to the statute\u2019s application. Instead, if a case fits the broad category of cases involving \u201cdeclaration of rights or legal relations with respect to . . . [t]he resolution of any other case or controversy that arises under the Idaho Code and referenced judicial proceedings under this chapter,\u201d then discretionary attorney fees may be awarded \u2013 whether or not TEDRA was invoked in an initial pleading.[xv] In sum, when faced with an unfavorable quotation not easily explained as dicta, the first line of defense is to look for other law contradicting the unfavorable statement. If many other legal sources contradict the unfavorable statement, a court will be forced to choose which to follow. And there is a fair chance the court will elect to follow the more established and thoroughly reasoned line of authority over a single line from an opinion that fails to acknowledge, distinguish, or repudiate the other line of authority. 2. Investigate Level of Briefing to the Appellate Court The second area of inquiry involves a lesser-known tool available to lawyers. The University of Idaho College of Law maintains a digital archive of not only the briefs but also the record in cases decided by the Idaho Supreme Court. This archive can be accessed at https://digitalcommons.law.uidaho.edu/iscrb/ and it allows a party to investigate the degree to which a particular issue was briefed to the Idaho Supreme Court. When faced with an unfavorable statement in an Idaho Supreme Court decision, reviewing the briefs on the issue can be informative. For example, in Matter of Smith, the TEDRA attorney fee issue was not briefed in any detail. In fact, the only mention of TEDRA was a parenthetical citation to the statute as part of a one-line request for fees in the Respondent\u2019s Brief.[xvi] Although the Appellant opposed an award of attorney fees, the reply brief did not address TEDRA at all.[xvii] When the Supreme Court record demonstrates a lack of attention to an issue and the statement in an appellate decision mirrors the parties\u2019 lack of analysis, it is easier to ask a lower court to evaluate the issue as a matter of first impression rather than rely on an adverse stray statement in a published decision. The adversary system is premised on the parties thoroughly addressing key issues in their briefing, so a decision made without briefing is not likely to reflect the conclusion that would have been reached on full briefing and argument. 3. Appeal to Policy Implications If adverse language in an appellate decision is consistent with other precedent and was thoroughly addressed by the opposing parties, it probably doesn\u2019t matter whether there are negative policy implications of applying the stated rule to other cases. But policy implications may take on more significance if either the language conflicts with other law or if the parties failed to meaningfully brief the issue in the prior case. This is particularly true when the issue involves a matter of common law, or if the governing statute or regulation is ambiguous. Returning to the example of Matter of Smith, as discussed previously, the language requiring TEDRA be included in the pleading does not appear in the text of the statute, it runs counter to other precedent, and the issue was not briefed by the parties. As such, the policy implications of requiring TEDRA be included in a pleading may be relevant to whether the language in Matter of Smith was intended as holding or as a resolution of the issue limited to the facts in Matter of Smith. Among the aims of TEDRA is to provide \u201cnonjudicial methods for the resolution of estate and trust matters by agreement.\u201d[xviii] But a pleading rule adopted by the Supreme Court creates a perverse incentive for a party to rush to the courthouse to file a declaratory suit that either affirmatively alleges or deliberately omits an invocation of the TEDRA fee regime. Such a pleading requirement would also have the downside of creating ambiguity about what would happen if the opposing party filed a counterclaim making the opposite election (either for or against TEDRA fees) in the counterclaim. Nothing in the text of TEDRA requires the pleading rule, so even modest policy implications of such a rule could be a basis for limiting the pleading rule from Matter of Smith to the facts of that case. Conclusion Whether the language from an appellate decision is favorable or unfavorable to your client\u2019s position, it is important to evaluate the degree to which a brief statement in an appellate decision can fairly be considered as controlling precedent that governs in other cases. Establishing whether the language is necessary to a holding is the first step. But even when the language appears necessary to the outcome, there is more work that can be done to evaluate the degree to which the language was intended to control other cases beyond the one at issue. Evaluating whether there is a conflicting line of authority, whether the parties meaningfully briefed the issue, and what the policy implications would be if the rule were broadly adopted, can help lawyers make arguments for or against the broader application of a \u201cholding\u201d that received limited attention in an appellate court decision.

L. Rev. 797 The Paradox of Precedent About Precedent Volume 138 Issue 3 January 2025 See full issue Download See Footnotes When the Supreme Court overrules or declines to overrule a past decision, it typically invokes precedent about precedent.1 These are prior cases that establish a framework for when stare decisis counsels for or against overruling a decision.2 \u201cPerhaps the most famous\u201d3 of these is Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.4 Casey and its stare decisis factors have long been the dominant framework endorsed by the Court in constitutional cases.5 And even in cases in which the Court did not cite Casey, it employed a framework that mirrored the one Casey developed.6 But Casey is not alone as a precedent about stare decisis. Precedent about precedent exists to help judges (and litigants) deal with a host of stare decisis questions.7 This Note deals with precedent about precedent as a conceptual whole, but Casey and Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization8 make for ideal examples of the phenomenon on which this Note focuses. Without a doubt, Dobbs overruled aspects of Casey\u2019s framework even as it employed some of the factors that Casey laid out.9 Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey as precedent about precedent has drawn significant criticism, including in the pages of this law review.10 These critics argue that the Court\u2019s stare decisis analysis in Dobbs was misguided because it departed from Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis either in theory or in application.11 But if Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis was incorrect from the start, then the Dobbs majority would have erred by employing that same conception of stare decisis. The fact that Dobbs refused to invoke Casey\u2019s understanding of how stare decisis worked is not solely a function of the Court\u2019s rightward shift\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it is a function of precedent about precedent. This Note argues that precedent about precedent is unique within the system of stare decisis because precedent about precedent is not entitled to the stare decisis weight to which it, as precedent about precedent, would entitle all other cases. Part I further sketches out the notion of precedent about precedent and employs Dobbs and Casey as examples of precedent about precedent in practice. Part II then argues that precedent about precedent\u2019s unique status poses a paradox. Finally, Part III explores some of the problems that develop within any theory of precedent about precedent because of the implications that flow from its paradoxical nature. I.\u00a0\u00a0Precedent About Precedent This Part defines precedent about precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0what it is, and what it isn\u2019t. It then uses Dobbs and Casey to explore the idea of overruling precedent about precedent. A.\u00a0\u00a0The Concept of Precedent About Precedent \u201cPrecedent about precedent\u201d or \u201cprecedent on precedent\u201d is a \u201cprior opinion[] identifying whether and how [a court] will regard its past precedents.\u201d12 In other words, precedent about precedent is what establishes the framework through which a court evaluates horizontal precedent. Precedent about precedent tells future courts what factors to consider and how to weigh them as part of their stare decisis analysis.13 So, questions such as, \u201cWhat counts as a reliance interest?\u201d14 or even, \u201cShould the Court consider reliance interests?\u201d15 are all questions for which precedent about precedent provides an answer. Additionally, precedent about precedent needs to be one of two things: (1) an explicit holding about how to treat other precedents; or (2) otherwise controlling,16 either because some other precedent makes it so17 or because the Court treats it as such.18 Therefore, the individual views of Justices do not create precedent about precedent for the Court, but they can affect how precedent about precedent applies in practice.19 This idea of precedent about precedent is not foreign to the Court or scholarship surrounding stare decisis. For example, then-Judge Kavanaugh invoked the concept when discussing Casey at his confirmation hearing,20 and literature evaluating the Roberts Court\u2019s approach to stare decisis relies on the concept of precedent about precedent.21 There are concepts to which this Note does not use the term \u201cprecedent about precedent\u201d to refer. Importantly, precedent about precedent as this Note uses it does not implicate vertical precedent. To be sure, there is precedent about vertical precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0namely, that it binds lower courts.22 But as a general matter, each court that employs some form of horizontal precedent can choose its stare decisis framework for itself.23 Whether the Supreme Court could employ its supervisory power to impose a binding, vertical precedent about horizontal precedent is another question.24 For now, it is enough to acknowledge the Court has never attempted to do so.25 The precedent about precedent this Note is concerned with, therefore, is the horizontal precedent that describes how a court should evaluate its own precedents. Finally, it is important to mention that precedent about precedent can change over time. This Note is premised on the idea that the Court can and does overrule or change aspects of its precedent about precedent.26 That matters because it means sometimes the Court needs to employ some sort of framework to decide when to modify its precedent about precedent. And when that modification happens, one central question is: From where does the framework for reevaluating a precedent about precedent come? In other words, does the Court use the existing framework that it is supposed to be reconsidering, or does it employ what it believes to be a new, better framework?27 Answering these questions is key to understanding precedent about precedent more deeply. B.\u00a0\u00a0Casey and Dobbs: A Case Study Casey and Dobbs provide excellent examples of precedent about precedent in practice and the overruling of precedent about precedent. As a result, they can help one understand the theory behind precedent about precedent and how the Court evaluates precedent about precedent in practice. Of course, both Casey and Dobbs were and remain polarizing decisions,28 but it is in the abortion context that the contours of precedent about precedent become the sharpest.29 So, putting aside the merits of those decisions for a moment, it is possible to explore how precedent about precedent functions in practice. Start with what made Casey the Court\u2019s central \u201cpaean to stare decisis\u201d for so many years.30 Casey not only synthesized the prior factors the Court had employed into one, (relatively) clear stare decisis framework,31 but also painstakingly detailed how to apply those factors.32 In doing so, Casey became an authority moving forward for how the Court would think about stare decisis.33 Whether or not Casey\u2019s framework was actually binding on future decisions is another question,34 but what matters is that, for a time, when the Court was faced with overruling a prior case, it would dutifully wheel out Casey\u2019s framework and, at a minimum, purport to apply it.35 Thus, Casey was \u201cprecedent on precedent.\u201d36 Enter Dobbs. The Dobbs majority rejected Casey\u2019s framework in two meaningful respects. First, it overruled Casey\u2019s approach to reliance interests by rejecting Casey\u2019s intangible reliance interests analysis.37 Second, the majority discarded the weight Casey gave to the impact of overruling Roe on the Court\u2019s legitimacy by focusing on Roe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s political divisiveness.38 In doing so, however, the Court did not use Casey\u2019s analysis to determine whether Casey\u2019s analysis should be overruled. If the Court had done so, Casey would have survived because overruling Casey\u2019s understanding of intangible reliance interests would have, for example, itself undermined intangible reliance interests.39 Instead, Dobbs employed what it viewed as the proper stare decisis framework and evaluated Casey in light of that conception of stare decisis.40 In overruling Casey as a precedent about precedent, Dobbs did not treat Casey\u2019s precedent about precedent as controlling. In sum, precedent about precedent tells future Courts how to evaluate precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the weight to give to reliance interests, how wrong the prior decision needs to be to overrule it, and so forth. But sometimes the Court overrules a prior precedent about precedent, as it did in Dobbs. In deciding whether to overrule the Casey framework, the Court did not employ the Casey framework. That decision is the central focus of this Note, which now turns to the paradox that necessitates that decision. II.\u00a0\u00a0The Paradox As the discussion of Dobbs and Casey suggests, precedent about precedent faces a unique wrinkle when it comes to stare decisis. This Part offers a theoretical explanation for this unique status by suggesting that precedent about precedent is paradoxical in nature. It then explores this paradox in practice by returning to Dobbs and some of the criticisms of Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey as a precedent about precedent. A.\u00a0\u00a0Theory The paradox of precedent about precedent is this: When the Court overrules a precedent about precedent, it cannot employ that precedent about precedent to evaluate the original precedent itself. As a result, precedent about precedent entitles all other cases to a certain amount of stare decisis weight before they are overruled, but the same stare decisis weight does not attach to the precedent about precedent when it faces its own repudiation. Unlike all other cases, precedent about precedent does not operate under the very rules the precedent establishes. A real-world example at the extreme demonstrates the underlying theory of why a precedent about precedent cannot be evaluated on its own terms. For a roughly sixty-eight year stretch, the House of Lords in the United Kingdom considered stare decisis absolute41 until it overruled that practice.42 In other words, the House of Lords\u2019 precedent about precedent did not permit it to ever overrule a precedent,43 but it nevertheless did so without feeling constrained by that precedent about precedent.44 If the Supreme Court were to adopt that approach and then later decide that such an approach was misguided, surely it could overrule its absolutist position, just as the House of Lords did, even though the absolutist approach to stare decisis would suggest that it could never itself be overruled. An alternative view would mean that the House of Lords acted illegitimately when it overruled its own absolutist meta-precedent, but there are a couple of problems with that view. First, such a position would raise serious questions about the ability of one majority to truly bind a future majority to a particular framework.45 A judge-made rule that could not be amended is like a statute that purports to be unamendable by Congress. So long as the source of the law is the same, there is no reason why a subsequent rule cannot replace a prior one.46 Second, such a position would present opportunities for gamesmanship.47 Therefore, the experience of the House of Lords demonstrates why it would be theoretically untenable to suggest that a precedent about precedent applies to itself. A simplified, numerical example helps illustrate this point for nonabsolute rules of meta-precedent. Imagine that the Court\u2019s existing framework for stare decisis established in Case A required the majority to be at least 90% certain that a prior case was wrongly decided before overruling that case.48 Now imagine that in Case B the Court has come to believe that its 90% bar was too high. Instead, the Court would like to use Case B as a vehicle to establish a new stare decisis framework. Under Case B\u2019s proposed rule, the Court could overrule a case when it is 75% certain the prior case was wrongly decided. Obviously, doing so would require overruling Case A as precedent about precedent. But here\u2019s the catch: Can the Court overrule Case A if it is only 80% sure Case A was wrongly decided? The answer should be \u201cyes\u201d for the same reason that the House of Lords could overrule its absolutist stare decisis position. If the House of Lords could overrule an absolutist rule without employing the absolutist rule, then Case B can overrule Case A without employing Case A\u2019s rule. Therefore, the old Case A\u2019s 90% framework will be subjected to Case B\u2019s new 75% framework instead of Case A\u2019s own framework. If Case B were merely overruling a run-of-the-mill merits decision in Case C, Case B would be bound by the normal rules of stare decisis to apply Case A\u2019s 90% framework. But because Case B is overruling a precedent about precedent, Case A does not receive the same stare decisis consideration that Case C would. That makes Case A, as a precedent about precedent, unique among other cases when it comes to stare decisis. Therein lies the heart of the paradox. A precedent about precedent is not entitled to the same stare decisis weight as all other precedent despite establishing how much stare decisis weight other precedents are to be given. Requiring the Court to employ the stare decisis framework that it views as incorrect to evaluate whether stare decisis compels it to retain that very framework would be both illogical and impractical. It would mean that one Court could set the rules of precedent about precedent for all time, a position that eschews traditional approaches to stare decisis. It would also mean that a Court could create special rules for favored cases, undermining the evenhanded application of stare decisis. Therefore, when asking whether Case B must use Case A\u2019s stare decisis framework to overrule Case A\u2019s framework, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d It is this inability to operate within the very framework that it establishes and that all other cases operate within that makes precedent about precedent unique. B.\u00a0\u00a0Practice In practice, this means that when the Court overrules aspects of its precedent about precedent, such as Casey, it cannot and will not use that precedent about precedent\u2019s framework. The theory behind the paradox of precedent about precedent means that a precedent about precedent should not be used to evaluate itself. This plays out in numerous cases involving revisions to precedent about precedent. Dobbs is a prime example,49 but there are others. Casey itself, in synthesizing a new stare decisis framework, did not purport to apply any particular prior framework.50 The Ramos v. Louisiana51 plurality, in attempting to overrule part of the Marks v. United States52 rule, did not first apply Marks; instead, it claimed Marks did not cover situations like the one in Ramos.53 Therefore, in some respects, the critics of the Dobbs majority have a point. Dobbs discarded or modified aspects of Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis without analyzing the Casey framework through any sort of stare decisis lens.54 But it is important to differentiate two different lines of criticism surrounding Dobbs\u2019s treatment of Casey. First, there is a \u201cmerits\u201d claim. This is simply the claim that as a matter of stare decisis\u00a0\u2014\u00a0regardless of the framework\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Casey should not have been overruled.55 Fair enough. It is the second line of criticism that matters for this Note\u2019s purposes. This is the \u201cmeta-precedent\u201d claim, meaning that it involves precedent about precedent. This criticism argues that Dobbs should have upheld Casey based on Casey\u2019s own stare decisis framework.56 The paradox of precedent about precedent demonstrates that this claim cannot be true. For one, it would create a theoretical mess. For another, practice surrounding precedent about precedent confirms that when Justices overrule (or attempt to modify) aspects of precedent about precedent, they do not apply the original precedent about precedent.57 In fairness, the lines often blur between the merits and meta-precedent arguments.58 When someone thinks that the original precedent about precedent was correct, he or she is likely to believe that a new stare decisis framework should not be applied because the old framework was correct on the merits.59 Again, nothing about the paradox of precedent about precedent suggests that the merits claim is illegitimate. When that claim becomes blurred with a meta-precedent claim, however, the criticism\u2019s footing becomes shakier. In other words, arguments that Dobbs should not have overruled Casey based on Dobbs\u2019s own conception of stare decisis60 are fair game. So too are arguments that Dobbs misconceived vital aspects of stare decisis.61 What the nature of precedent about precedent prevents is arguments that Dobbs erred by not applying Casey\u2019s formulation of stare decisis. In short then, precedent about precedent\u2019s unique paradoxical nature prevents it from applying to itself. What exists in theory plays itself out in practice, as Dobbs (and Ramos) demonstrate. But this paradox is only the beginning. The strange nature of precedent about precedent gives rise to other theoretical problems\u00a0\u2014\u00a0problems that the Court has not reasoned through. III.\u00a0\u00a0The Problems This paradox that precedent about precedent creates presents a host of problems. This Part examines those problems and offers a preliminary account of how judges and scholars ought to think about them. It also shines light on an area of law the Court too often neglects to theorize adequately. A.\u00a0\u00a0The Problem of Overruling Precedent About Precedent The first problem that this theory of precedent about precedent presents is what to do about overruling precedent about precedent. Previously, this Note has focused on the theory behind overruling a precedent about precedent in order to lower the bar for overruling cases. But the problem of overruling precedent about precedent exists in both directions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0making it easier to overrule precedent and making it harder. 1.\u00a0\u00a0Lowering the Bar for Overruling.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0The first problem with overruling precedent about precedent occurs whenever the Court makes it easier to overrule precedent\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in other words, when the Court lowers the bar for overruling prior cases by modifying the prior precedent about precedent. For most cases, this is relatively straightforward. When the Court weakens or overrules a real-world stare decisis factor, it employs the new calculus to overrule the prior precedent about precedent.62 This is the key insight of recognizing that precedent about precedent presents a paradox. Dobbs is once again a prime example of this. In rejecting Casey\u2019s judicial-legitimacy justification for retaining Roe,63 the Court focused on Roe\u2019s and Casey\u2019s disruption of democratic deliberation around the abortion question.64 It did not employ Casey\u2019s conception of stare decisis. Many of the factors it invoked were the same,65 but Dobbs used its own stare decisis calculus to decide whether Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis was correct.66 To the extent that one thinks this approach to stare decisis in the precedent about precedent context is problematic, it is largely inescapable. An alternative solution is simply not feasible for logical and practical reasons.67 There is a larger problem looming, however. So far, this Note has assumed that Case A (requiring 90% certainty) meets Case B\u2019s criteria for overruling (requiring 75%). But what happens if Case A comes up short? This would occur if the Court was only 70% certain that Case A was wrong. Is Case A as a precedent about precedent entitled to any stare decisis respect? In these instances, precedent about precedent presents the problem that this Note has only so far hinted at\u00a0\u2014\u00a0can one Court bind a future Court methodologically?68 In practice, the Court seems not to bother with stare decisis when it modifies precedent about precedent. For example, rather than determine whether Casey\u2019s conception of reliance was workable, had itself engendered reliance interests, and so forth, the Dobbs Court made a merits judgment that Casey was wrong about reliance, and then it overruled Casey on that point.69 This suggests that stare decisis for precedent about precedent is empty (or so extremely merits sensitive that it overrides any other considerations).70 In other words, the Court makes a merits decision about what the correct rule of precedent is, and then it implements that rule regardless of whether the old precedent about precedent meets the new criteria for overruling. So if the Court is only 70% sure Case A was wrong, it still overrules Case A and adopts a 75% threshold in Case B. The Court does not in practice apply the new stare decisis framework to the old one. This is both a problem and a potential solution. On the one hand, it undermines the idea of precedent about precedent as binding in practice. And if precedent about precedent isn\u2019t binding, why do judicial nominees profess fidelity to it,71 and what good is it? So that is a problem. On the other hand, if precedent about precedent does not get any stare decisis effect, then there is a way to explain the Court\u2019s practice of seemingly ignoring stare decisis when it comes to precedent about precedent: The Court does not bother going through the stare decisis factors when overruling precedent about precedent because it is a purely merits-motivated decision. A couple of implications flow from this position. First, the Court and judicial nominees can still claim that they are bound by precedent about precedent in almost all cases.72 Overruling precedent about precedent is a special case where precedent about precedent does not apply. This understanding of precedent about precedent comports with the theoretical point from earlier that precedent about precedent does not apply to itself.73 It also allows one to retain the view that precedent about precedent is constraining to some degree.74 It is just not constraining when it comes to itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0hence, the paradox. Recognizing that overruling precedent about precedent is a purely merits-based decision also solves the problem of what to do when Case B wants to overrule Case A as precedent about precedent, but Case A does not meet Case B\u2019s criteria for overruling. Because the decision to overrule Case A as precedent about precedent is a pure merits question, it does not matter if Case A satisfies Case B\u2019s framework.75 Finally, from a positivist perspective, it seems to provide a descriptively correct account of the law. If one accepts the view that the Court can create binding precedent about precedent, understanding the paradox of precedent about precedent in this way helps explain behaviors in some of the Court\u2019s most recent cases involving precedent about precedent.76 To be sure, viewing precedent about precedent as binding except when its own framework is at issue is not the only possible solution to this problem. Another solution is to reject the idea that one Court can methodologically bind future Courts. This would do away with precedent about precedent as a concept. On the one hand, this might be a compelling solution because there are certainly some situations in which it seems the Court cannot methodologically bind itself.77 However, adopting this view runs into a couple of problems. First, it would not explain why the Court talks about precedent about precedent in the way it does. If precedent about precedent is not binding in cases where the precedent itself is at issue, why does the Court repeatedly suggest that precedent about precedent matters?78 Second, there are instances in which the Court does adopt binding methodologies.79 Perhaps this is incorrect,80 or precedent about precedent can be differentiated from these situations,81 but at the very least, discarding the idea of precedent about precedent is a drastic step. A final, related solution would be to view precedent about precedent as permissive but not mandatory in all cases. This would make precedent about precedent a special case of the view that Professor Richard Re has outlined.82 Following Re\u2019s approach, the Court could invoke precedent about precedent to \u201cestablish[] the lawfulness of a particular course of action without requiring any additional inquiry,\u201d but \u201c[i]t would remain fully open to the judge to deviate from the precedent, provided that doing so is otherwise lawful.\u201d83 In other words, it is lawful for the Court to retain precedent about precedent because it is precedent, but it is also lawful for the Court to choose to ignore or revoke the permission that precedent about precedent bestows.84 On the descriptive side, the precedent about precedent permission model avoids reading too much into the Court\u2019s statements that precedent about precedent has some binding force; while the Court may proclaim that precedent about precedent is binding, \u201cthe Justices may help themselves to a rhetoric of bindingness while engaging in a practice that is best described in terms of permissions.\u201d85 Thus, the permission model describes the Court\u2019s practices in a \u201cdo-as-I-do,\u201d not in a \u201cdo-as-I-say,\u201d manner, which is a less drastic step than discarding the concept of precedent about precedent in toto, but it still requires one to discount significantly the purported constraint of precedent about precedent. Thus, whenever the Court makes it easier to overrule precedent about precedent, there is a chance that a theoretical problem will present itself. However, there are a couple of ways to reconceptualize precedent about precedent in order to get around this problem, depending on one\u2019s view of whether one majority can methodologically bind a future majority. Each potential solution has its merits and drawbacks. The point here is not to definitively defend one solution but to demonstrate that the paradoxical nature of precedent about precedent requires more theorization about precedent and its constraining power\u00a0\u2014\u00a0theorization at which the Justices have only waved their hands.86 2.\u00a0\u00a0Raising the Bar for Overruling.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0When the Court raises the bar for overruling precedent, it triggers the second problem with overruling precedent about precedent. This problem is more complex than the problem that arises from lowering the bar for overruling precedent, but it again serves the point of highlighting the paradoxical nature of precedent about precedent. The issue imagined here is reversal of the prior examples; instead of establishing a 75% threshold for overruling a case (call that Case X), the Court wants to establish a 90% certainty requirement (call that Case Y). If the Court is 95% confident that Case X is wrong as a precedent about precedent, then there is no problem at all because the Court\u2019s decision satisfies both Case X\u2019s and Case Y\u2019s requirements. The difficulty arises when the Court is only 80% sure Case X is wrong. In that instance, Case X should be overruled on its own terms, but Case Y, which is supposed to be the new stare decisis framework, suggests that overruling would be inappropriate. The Marks rule is instructive. Imagine if a plurality of the Court were to adopt the view that Marks should be abandoned so that only a majority opinion created binding precedent,87 and a fifth Justice whose vote was necessary to create a judgment in the case adopted the position that Marks was never actually binding law because it was an interpretive methodology for precedents like Auer88 deference is for regulations.89 Under Marks, the plurality position would be binding as the \u201cnarrowest grounds\u201d of agreement.90 But the plurality position would be that Marks is overruled and only a true majority position is binding. In other words, following Marks\u2019s own rule, Marks would be overruled, but following the precedent that the Marks rule purports to establish via the plurality opinion, Marks would not be overruled. Granted, such a situation would probably be a rarity. Ramos, however, came close to exemplifying this problem. There, a plurality claimed that Apodaca v. Oregon91 provided no binding precedent under the Marks rule because Justice Powell\u2019s separate opinion, which was necessary to create a judgment of the Court, would have overruled prior precedent92\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a position which the other eight Justices in Apodaca rejected.93 Therefore, the Ramos plurality would have adopted a rule of precedent about precedent that the Marks rule does not create binding precedent when the controlling opinion \u201crepudiate[s] this Court\u2019s repeated pre-existing teachings on\u201d an area of law.94 In other words, the plurality would have modified the Marks rule to ensure \u201ca single Justice writing only for himself\u201d does not have \u201cthe authority to bind this Court to propositions it has already rejected.\u201d95 To be sure, the plurality did not view this as a partial repudiation of the Marks rule\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but the other six Justices did.96 So, taking the plurality\u2019s approach as an attempt to overrule Marks in part,97 it is interesting that Justice Gorsuch did not acknowledge the awkwardness of his position.98 The plurality\u2019s position was that a mere plurality could not\u00a0\u2014\u00a0consistent with Marks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0overrule settled precedent. Yet, the lead opinion in Ramos was a plurality attempting to overrule what the other Justices took as a settled application of Marks.99 Assume for a minute that Justice Gorsuch\u2019s position was the narrowest one in Ramos concerning Marks.100 Under Marks, the view that a plurality opinion cannot overrule prior precedent therefore would be controlling.101 But under the Ramos plurality\u2019s view that the Marks rule now says is controlling, a plurality opinion that overrules prior precedent cannot be controlling.102 By attempting to raise the bar for overruling precedent, the Ramos plurality has ensured that its own rule is invalid.103 The point is that the nature of precedent about precedent creates this paradoxical situation that makes one\u2019s head hurt if thought about for too long. As a result, there needs to be a way out of this problem. Fortunately, the solutions from before can help. If the decision to raise the bar for overruling\u00a0\u2014\u00a0just like the decision to lower the bar\u00a0\u2014 is truly a merits question without any consideration for stare decisis, then it does not matter if Case X does not meet Case Y\u2019s new criteria for overruling. Case Y can simply replace Case X\u2019s framework based on a merits judgment that Case X was wrong. And if stare decisis does not attach to precedent about precedent, then it is possible to avoid the Marks/Ramos-plurality problem. It does not matter whether the Ramos plurality\u2019s view of Marks is precedential or not because the Court in a future case can always resolve the question anew based on its own view of the merits.104 The same implication holds if the Court cannot methodologically bind itself; neither Marks nor the Ramos plurality\u2019s revision of Marks affects future Courts from a precedent about precedent perspective. The Court is entitled to determine whether a prior fractured case is entitled to stare decisis based on its own views. It is not bound by Marks or any other rule. Finally, if precedent about precedent is permissive, then the Ramos plurality could have lawfully followed Marks, but it did not have to do so.105 Likewise, in the future, the Court can continue to treat Marks as permissive precedent about precedent,106 or it can reevaluate its rules for fractured decisions.107 At bottom, if precedent about precedent does not apply to itself and overruling it does not trigger stare decisis considerations, judges and scholars can avoid some of the problems that the paradox of precedent about precedent seems to present. This is just one possible way of conceptualizing the unique status of precedent about precedent, but it has the benefit of making meta-precedent still a worthwhile inquiry for all other cases. The other conceptualizations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0rejecting methodological binding and viewing precedent as permission\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are also viable. Right now, however, the Court is not thinking hard about the status of precedent about precedent or its implications. B.\u00a0\u00a0The Problem of Individual Approaches to Precedent About Precedent The paradox also affects individual Justices\u2019 approaches to precedent about precedent. Yet this phenomenon too goes unrealized in the Court\u2019s current writings on precedent. Earlier, precedent about precedent was defined as, at a minimum, something a majority of the Court viewed as binding.108 That means that idiosyncratic views, such as Justice Thomas\u2019s, do not count as precedent about precedent no matter how many times they are reiterated in concurrences. But what happens when members of the Court do not follow the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent?109 Or worse yet, what if a panel on the court of appeals believes that the circuit\u2019s horizontal precedent rules, which were adopted as Circuit Rules, are unconstitutional?110 Precedent about precedent does not really matter if individual Justices or judges do not follow it.111 This section discusses the problems that individualized approaches to stare decisis create. The preeminent example of the problem of an individual rejection of precedent about precedent is Justice Thomas\u2019s approach in Gamble v. United States.112 There, Justice Thomas outlined a different stare decisis approach that focused on the nature of the prior decision\u2019s error.113 Justice Thomas argued that the Court can adhere to incorrect prior decisions so long as they are not \u201cdemonstrably erroneous,\u201d but that judges are not bound by wrongly decided precedent regardless of the precedent\u2019s workability or reliance interests.114 Justice Thomas\u2019s view, then, looks very similar to the precedent as permission view (although with mandatory overruling of demonstrably erroneous precedents).115 His view certainly does not follow the Court\u2019s precedents about stare decisis.116 Voting based on a different stare decisis analysis weakens precedent about precedent overall because even if precedent about precedent is not binding on itself, the Court\u2019s rhetoric treats it as binding when applied to other cases.117 But if one or more Justices take a different approach than the majority does about the proper standard for stare decisis, the bindingness of precedent about precedent is watered down. Imagine if the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent required a case to meet factors A, B, and C to warrant overruling. In a particular case, four Justices believe a prior case has met all three factors, four Justices believe the prior case has met none, and the final Justice believes the case has met factor A. Should the prior case be overruled? In the abstract sense, the answer should be \u201cno\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0five Justices have decided that the three factors necessary for overruling have not been met. But if the ninth Justice believes that only factor A should be necessary for overruling, then the Court will overrule the prior case because a majority of the Court thinks the case should be overruled, even though a majority does not think that the case satisfies the criteria that the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent outlines. Thus, one arrives at a result that seems problematic if precedent about precedent is taken seriously. But Justice Thomas is not alone. There is also the phenomenon of the \u201cperpetual dissent.\u201d118 This is the practice of individual Justices continuing to author \u201copinions that reiterate a past dissenting view and then offer a rationale different from the majority\u2019s (either to concur or dissent)\u201d because the \u201cJustice refuses to accept the rule of a prior decision .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0as controlling authority.\u201d119 The most famous of these is Justices Brennan\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s standard practice of dissenting from the constitutionality of the death penalty,120 but the practice exists in multiple areas of law across judicial ideology.121 Interestingly, when Justices engage in perpetual dissent, they typically do not employ the Court\u2019s stare decisis framework; instead, they focus on reiterating their view that the prior case or line of cases was wrongly decided on the merits.122 That suggests that when Justices engage in perpetual dissent, they are ignoring the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent and focusing solely on the merits. Again, this waters down the practical effect of precedent about precedent. \u201cPrecedent about precedent is usually binding,\u201d the perpetual dissenters seem to say, \u201cbut not when it comes to this issue about which I really care.\u201d123 This rejection of precedent about precedent, either as a whole framework (in the case of Justice Thomas) or in specific applications (in the case of some perpetual dissenters), is possible because precedent about precedent is not binding on itself. Therefore, individual Justices can make a merits decision that they will not adhere to the Court\u2019s precedents about precedent in certain contexts without worrying about any other stare decisis considerations.124 Thus, it seems that the paradox of precedent about precedent shapes judicial behavior by allowing for these individualized approaches. However, the earlier discussion of potential solutions to the problem of overruling precedent about precedent suggested that even if precedent about precedent is not binding on itself, there is value in seeing it as binding for all other cases.125 In other words, Casey was not binding when determining whether to overrule Casey as precedent about precedent, but it was binding when deciding whether to overrule other decisions.126 When individual Justices take a different approach, however, it looks like precedent about precedent is not binding even when applied to other cases. There are a couple of possible solutions to this quandary as well. One possibility is to write off these individual views as illegitimate\u00a0\u2014\u00a0an example of Justices \u201celevating [their] individual jurisprudence\u201d above the Court\u2019s own doctrine.127 From a purely theoretical standpoint, this position has appeal. It fits with the view that precedent about precedent is constraining at least when applied to other cases, even if not when applied to itself. When Justices ignore precedent about precedent in favor of their own views, they devalue the constraining force of precedent about precedent and thereby weaken the value of precedent as a whole.128 From a practical standpoint, however, this view cannot explain why Justices continue to vote according to their own views on precedent rather than the Court\u2019s.129 It also ignores the fact that there is no disciplining method for Justices who refuse to follow the Court\u2019s precedent about precedent.130 Thus, this view fits well with some of the theoretical arguments from before, but it may suffer in its description of actual practice. That leads to the nonbinding view of precedent about precedent again. If precedent about precedent is not constraining on the Justices either because the Court cannot methodologically bind its members or because precedent about precedent is merely permissive, then individual Justices can legitimately refuse to follow precedent about precedent in favor of their own views.131 This view can, therefore, explain why Justices continue to favor personal precedent over institutional precedent about precedent,132 but it does not explain why individual Justices also continue to invoke the idea that the Court as a whole must adhere to its precedent about precedent.133 To summarize, the paradox of precedent about precedent spills over into individual approaches to precedent about precedent. There are different ways of thinking about these individual approaches, each of which offers its own set of justifications. Those approaches each present their own weakness as well. In the status quo, however, the Court and individual Justices neglect to think about these problems when they discuss precedent about precedent. Conclusion Precedent about precedent presents a paradox that gives it a unique status within our system of stare decisis because a court overruling precedent about precedent will not apply the stare decisis framework that the precedent about precedent established. Dobbs is a recent example of this phenomenon, but many critics of Dobbs have faulted the Court for not applying Casey\u2019s stare decisis framework even as Dobbs overruled Casey as precedent about precedent. These critiques make little sense in light of the unique nature of precedent about precedent. Of course, that unique nature creates issues that the Court too often ignores. In particular, the paradox of precedent about precedent raises difficult questions about whether one Court can bind a future Court to a particular stare decisis framework and about the binding nature of precedent itself. This is an especially pressing problem on a Court deeply divided about the weight and value of stare decisis.134 It also demonstrates the difficulty that individual views about precedent create for a coherent system of precedent about precedent. This Note does not purport to resolve all of these problems, but it offers some preliminary answers. More than that, however, it is a call to future Courts and scholars to think more seriously about the concept of precedent about precedent. Footnotes Hide show ^ See, e.g., Kimble v.

This Note uses the term \u201cbinding\u201d to describe the notion that the Court at least treats prior cases as constraining. Of course, as a practical matter the Supreme Court is never truly bound by anything more than its own willingness to treat itself as constrained by prior cases because it is not subject to appellate review. In other words, if the Court tomorrow decided to discard all of its precedents, nothing really stops it from doing so other than a sense of constraint from its own norms about stare decisis. Thus, when one speaks of the Court being \u201cbound,\u201d one is really speaking about varying degrees of constraint, all of which can be overcome. Return to citation ^ ^ See Marks v.

Confusingly, Apodaca was decided alongside Johnson, which meant that many of the opinions, such as Justice Powell\u2019s disputed Apodaca opinion, were actually filed under Johnson. Nevertheless, Apodaca was the splintered opinion that created the bizarre situation confronted in Ramos. Compare Johnson, 406 U.S. at 357 (commanding five votes), with Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 405 (plurality opinion) (commanding only four votes). Return to citation ^ ^ Ramos, 140 S.

Justice Thomas also treated Apodaca as binding for the Due Process Clause, see id. at 1424\u201325 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment), but he would have decided the case under the Privileges or Immunities Clause, id. at 1425. Return to citation ^ ^ See Varsava, supra note 21, at 125 (claiming Justice Gorsuch\u2019s approach \u201crepresents a significant departure from prevailing judicial norms\u201d). Return to citation ^ ^ But see Ramos, 140 S. Ct. at 1432 (Alito, J., dissenting) (noting the \u201cirony\u201d of a fractured opinion criticizing Apodaca as \u201cfractured\u201d and therefore not binding (quoting id. at 1397 (majority opinion))).

Ct. at 1402\u201303 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.). Return to citation ^ ^ To tie things back together, the Ramos plurality is like Case Y with its higher bar, and the Marks rule is like Case X with its lower bar. Return to citation ^ ^ This does create some difficulty for lower courts attempting to determine the scope of the Marks rule moving forward. See The Supreme Court, 2019 Term\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Leading Cases, supra note 100, at 529. But see Ryan C. Williams, Questioning Marks: Plurality Decisions and Precedential Constraint, 69 Stan. L. Rev. 795, 799 (2017) (arguing lower courts are already in a state of confusion regarding Marks). Return to citation ^ ^ See Re, supra note 16, at 920. Return to citation ^ ^ Whether the permissive aspect of Marks has been withdrawn by the Ramos plurality is one final wrinkle. See id. at 921\u201322. But even if Ramos now supplies the permissive precedent, the nature of permissive precedent means that the Court could still return to Marks if that were the correct rule of law. See id. at 920. Return to citation ^ ^ See, e.g., Re, supra note 26, at 1946 (proposing a complete elimination of Marks); Williams, supra note 104, at 839\u201344 (proposing a \u201cshared agreement\u201d approach to Marks, id. at 839).

Justice Thomas\u2019s view suggests that his approach to precedent about precedent is constitutionally mandated rather than a judicially crafted doctrine. Compare id., with Ramos v. Louisiana, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 1411 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (quoting 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *69; The Federalist No. 78, at 529 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961); Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 378 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring)) (implicitly suggesting a common law basis for his approach to precedent about precedent). Return to citation ^ ^ See Gary Lawson, The Constitutional Case Against Precedent, 17 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y 23, 25\u201328 (1994). Interestingly, despite fulsome debate in the Supreme Court about the proper stare decisis framework, see, e.g., Re, supra note 16, at 908 (\u201c[T]he U.S. Supreme Court has become unusually preoccupied with issues of precedent.\u201d), there is remarkably little criticism of the law-of-the-circuit doctrine from lower court judges, see Mead, supra note 12, at 799\u2013800 (\u201cToday, judges accept the law-of-the-circuit rules without major objection .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d).

By Sarah Kessler Published: September 30, 2024 National National Next week marks the start of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s new term. As usual, some of the appeals on the Court\u2019s docket will come from state courts of last resort. When can the Supreme Court weigh in on an issue already decided by a state\u2019s highest court? The answer is not straightforward. Since the country\u2019s founding, state courts have had the final say on questions of state law. But they share responsibility with federal courts for interpreting and applying federal law. As a result, competing concerns \u2014 ensuring that state courts correctly and consistently apply federal law and respecting their autonomy \u2014 have led to a complex set of rules for when the Supreme Court takes appeals from the state courts. The rules stem both from federal legislation and the Supreme Court\u2019s own interpretive guidance, developed in centuries of opinions. General rule The Constitution provides a high-level foundation for the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction over appeals directly from state courts, allowing for review of state decisions involving issues related to federal statutes, treaties, or constitutional law. Congress elaborated on the specifics in the Judiciary Act of 1789, which it has repeatedly updated over time. As a general matter, today\u2019s version provides that the Supreme Court may review appeals from \u201cfinal judgments\u201d issued \u201cby the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\u201d that raise a question under the same three areas of federal law. This statute applies to both civil and criminal appeals. The \u201chighest court of a State\u201d usually means the state\u2019s supreme court, but an appeal from a lower court can qualify if the appealing party has exhausted all available appellate options within the state system. For example, the Supreme Court has accepted review from intermediate courts where the state high court\u2019s denial of a request to appeal barred further state review or where state procedural rules gave no additional right to appeal within the state. Similarly, the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule typically requires a case to be fully resolved in the state courts, not subject to ongoing proceedings. The Supreme Court has counted as \u201cfinal judgments,\u201d however, certain circumstances where the federal issue has been finally decided, but other aspects of the case are still in progress. In particular, the Court may hear a state appeal where the federal issue would survive and require a decision regardless of the outcome of the other parts, would be precluded from review at a later point (such as because the issue will be mooted), \u201cmight seriously erode federal policy\u201d if not immediately reviewed, or where resolution of the federal issue would conclude the remaining proceedings. Adequate and independent state grounds Appeals from state courts frequently involve both state law and federal law questions. If the decision below rested on an \u201cadequate and independent state ground,\u201d the Supreme Court may not review it. The Supreme Court has interpreted its jurisdiction this way to avoid issuing advisory opinions \u2014 judicial guidance offered when an actual case is not at stake \u2014 in violation of a separate jurisdictional bar the Court has recognized since its founding. If the state court would reach the same result based on state law in any event, weighing in on the federal issue would be purely advisory, the reasoning goes. What counts as an \u201cadequate and independent state ground\u201d for a state court decision? The Supreme Court makes that determination itself and has provided longstanding guidance. To be \u201cadequate,\u201d the state basis must have \u201cfair support\u201d or, put another way, not be \u201cplainly untenable.\u201d The basis also must be broad enough on its own to sustain the judgment. An \u201cindependent\u201d state basis is not dependent on, or \u201cinterwoven with,\u201d federal law. For example, it\u2019s not enough for a state court to cite state cases as support for its ruling, if those state cases are themselves applications of federal law. Similarly, \u201cwhere a state court has \u2018felt compelled by what it understood to be federal constitutional considerations to construe and apply its own law in the manner it did,\u2019\u201d the Supreme Court has said that does not qualify. In practice, this rule means that a state court decision that interprets the state\u2019s constitution in \u201clockstep\u201d \u2014 or in adherence \u2014 with the federal Constitution may be more vulnerable to Supreme Court review. Even with the Court\u2019s longstanding guidance, determining whether a state decision is based on an adequate and independent state ground is not always clear-cut. The Supreme Court in Michigan v. Long introduced an approach to resolving that ambiguity that the Court has used for the last forty years. When a state ruling \u201cfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law,\u201d the Court will assume there is no adequate and independent state ground, unless the state court made a \u201cplain statement\u201d clearly indicating otherwise. Some justices have criticized this presumption as making it harder for states freely to develop their own laws. Under the framework, a state court would have to anticipate that references to federal law could be viewed as ambiguous by the Court and so would trigger the requirement expressly to convey that the decision rests on an adequate and independent state ground. Nonetheless, a majority of the Court has followed the \u201cplain statement\u201d approach in most ambiguous cases since Long. On occasion, however, where there was \u201cconsiderable uncertainty as to the precise grounds\u201d for the state decision or the state court did not issue an opinion, the Court has vacated the decision and remanded to the state court for clarification. State procedural rules Sometimes a state court rejects a federal claim based on a state procedural rule \u2014 for example, it may rule the claim was untimely or waived \u2014 rather than considering the substance of the claim. A procedural rule may also serve as an adequate and independent state ground that precludes Supreme Court review of the federal question. In deciding whether a state procedural rule is an \u201cadequate\u201d ground, the Supreme Court generally has focused on consistency of application. A state procedural rule typically qualifies if it is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed\u201d and has been applied neutrally, not in a way that avoids or \u201coperates to the particular disadvantage\u201d of federal claims. These criteria, the Court has indicated, are intended to protect claimants\u2019 procedural due process rights and the supremacy of federal law. In line with those concerns, the Court has recognized rare circumstances where the application of even a \u201cgenerally sound\u201d procedural rule \u201crenders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.\u201d These \u201cexceptional\u201d cases have included applications that are \u201cnovel\u201d or \u201cabruptly depart\u201d from prior interpretations, or where the claimant\u2019s compliance with the rule, although not perfect, is \u201csufficient\u201d to serve the state\u2019s procedural interest. They also have tended to involve more consequential federal claims, asserting constitutional rights. New federal question Occasionally, a party believes the highest state court\u2019s decision raises a new federal question. Will the Supreme Court review the case even though that issue was not asserted below? The general rule is no. Out of respect for state courts and desire for a developed appellate record, the Court ordinarily requires a federal claim to have been addressed by, or presented to, the state court whose decision is being appealed, although a party\u2019s arguments in support of that claim can vary. While the Court\u2019s recent rulings have tended to treat this requirement as prudential \u2014 or excusable under the circumstances of particular cases \u2014 earlier decisions viewed it as jurisdictional, and the question has never actually been settled by the Court. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The adequate and independent state ground doctrine provides an incentive for state courts to develop and apply state constitutional law distinctly from federal law. In the event a losing party appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court a decision based on state law that clearly and expressly departs from federal law, the Supreme Court should decline and the state court should have the last word on the issue.

Idaho Law Foundation Home / Blog Digital Advocate Precedent Predicaments February 1, 2023 by Lindsey Welfley By John E. Cutler Within our adversary system, the judicial branch resolves cases based on evidence and arguments presented by opposing parties.[i] As a general matter, courts do not look beyond the parties\u2019 arguments to determine whether there might be other issues or arguments that could have been raised for or against a matter presented for decision.[ii] This dynamic results in appellate decisions that are focused on resolving the dispute between the parties, without a plenary discussion of all potential issues or applications of the various statutes, regulations, common law principles, or public policies potentially at issue. Given the narrow, dispute-resolution focus fostered by our adversary system, it is not uncommon for an appellate decision to include a phrase or sentence that is inconsequential to the matter at hand but dispositive in another legal context. At other times, the parties\u2019 failure to fully address an issue may cause an appellate court to resolve that issue briefly and without substantial analysis. This article aims to help lawyers in dealing with such precedent predicaments. These byproducts of the adversary system can present a predicament for lawyers and judges in later cases: precedent. Although the adversary system requires resolution of cases on the record presented, the rule of vertical stare decisis means that published appellate decisions are treated as binding precedent for lower courts. Whether language in an appellate opinion was central to the decision or only an afterthought, zealous advocates are sure to latch onto every word in a published opinion to deploy it in support of arguments on behalf of their clients.[iii] Likewise, lower courts will strive to be faithful to precedent by giving legal effect to language in appellate decisions, whether addressed in a single sentence or a lengthy discussion. The result of this predicament may later cause the Supreme Court to \u201creframe the central issue\u201d in the case before it.[iv] As the Court explained in Allen v. Campbell, it was \u201cunderstandable that the parties and the district court treated [the statute] as bearing on subject matter jurisdiction because this Court essentially said so forty years ago. . . . But a close reading of [our earlier decision] reveals that we misspoke . . . .\u201d[v] It can be hard to know whether an appellate court \u201cmisspoke,\u201d but lawyers have at least a few options when they suspect a line from a decision was not intended to govern the issues presented in their case. Dicta? The first question to answer when evaluating language from an appellate decision is whether the language is \u201cdictum and not controlling.\u201d[vi] When a \u201cstatement\u201d in an appellate decision was \u201cnot necessary to decide the issue presented to the appellate court,\u201d the statement is dictum.[vii] Establishing that unfavorable language was dicta should be the first line of defense when presented with a statement from an appellate decision that is adverse to a client\u2019s interest. But lawyers would do well not to stop there. Dictum is like an idea previously planted in the court\u2019s awareness that may become controlling if a court later finds it persuasive.[viii] Thus, the tools for dealing with what appears to be an adverse precedent are also relevant in addressing adverse dicta. Practice Ideas for When You Suspect the Appellate Court \u201cMisspoke\u201d In some cases, a statement in an appellate decision cannot easily be written off as dictum. For example, in Matter of Estate of Smith, the Idaho Supreme Court rejected a party\u2019s request for attorney fees under \u201cthe Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act\u201d (\u201cTEDRA\u201d), Idaho Code Sections 15-8-101 to 15-8-305.[ix] The Court\u2019s brief analysis of the issue follows: [TEDRA] permits the court to award costs and fees from any party, assets of the estate or trust, or nonprobate asset that is subject of the proceedings. I.C. \u00a7 15-8-208(1); Quemada v. Arizmendez, 153 Idaho 609, 617, 288 P.3d 826, 834 (2012). Unlike in Quemada, Joseph did not file his initial petition for probate pursuant to TEDRA, Idaho Code section 15-3-302. As such, this was not a TEDRA proceeding and its costs and fees provision does not have applicability here.[x] The statement that failure to \u201cfile [the] initial petition for probate pursuant to TEDRA\u201d renders the case \u201cnot a TEDRA proceeding\u201d appears to be necessary to the Court\u2019s decision denying an award of TEDRA fees and costs.[xi] On the other hand, the brevity of the analysis prompts a question of the intended scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on this issue. Using Matter of Smith as an example, the remainder of this article addresses three areas of inquiry for counsel faced with a short statement in an appellate case that appears controlling at first blush. 1. Evaluate Consistency with Other Law The first area of inquiry when confronting stray language in an opinion that appears to control an issue, is to investigate whether there are other lines of conflicting authority in statute, regulations, or cases. Demonstrating to a court that a brief unfavorable statement from one opinion conflicts with the plain language of a statute or a long line of thoroughly reasoned analysis in another line of cases can go a long way. Courts do not hide elephants in mouseholes. Although an appellate court\u2019s statement may appear unequivocal and necessary to a decision, if that statement is not accompanied by any reasoning distinguishing it from a prior line of cases or the clear text of the statute, there is a good argument to preclude application of that statement to other cases. As an example of this, the TEDRA pleading requirement embraced in the terse holding in Matter of Smith, appears to conflict with the language of Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(4)(A) providing that it is \u201cnot necessary for any party in a civil action to assert a claim for attorney fees in any pleading\u201d other than a default judgment.[xii] Similarly, in Straub v. Smith,[xiii] the Idaho Supreme Court held that because a case did \u201cnot involve a default judgment . . . to require that attorney fees be pleaded in this case would be contrary to I.R.C.P. 54(e)(4).\u201d Finally, the text of TEDRA contains no express pleading requirement and instead includes text indicating that it \u201cshall not be construed as being limited by any other specific statutory provision providing for the payment of costs, unless such statute specifically provides otherwise.\u201d[xiv] In other words, the rules of civil procedure, existing precedent on attorney fees, and the text of TEDRA itself all suggest that a party is not required to specifically invoke the statute in a pleading as a precursor to the statute\u2019s application. Instead, if a case fits the broad category of cases involving \u201cdeclaration of rights or legal relations with respect to . . . [t]he resolution of any other case or controversy that arises under the Idaho Code and referenced judicial proceedings under this chapter,\u201d then discretionary attorney fees may be awarded \u2013 whether or not TEDRA was invoked in an initial pleading.[xv] In sum, when faced with an unfavorable quotation not easily explained as dicta, the first line of defense is to look for other law contradicting the unfavorable statement. If many other legal sources contradict the unfavorable statement, a court will be forced to choose which to follow. And there is a fair chance the court will elect to follow the more established and thoroughly reasoned line of authority over a single line from an opinion that fails to acknowledge, distinguish, or repudiate the other line of authority. 2. Investigate Level of Briefing to the Appellate Court The second area of inquiry involves a lesser-known tool available to lawyers. The University of Idaho College of Law maintains a digital archive of not only the briefs but also the record in cases decided by the Idaho Supreme Court. This archive can be accessed at https://digitalcommons.law.uidaho.edu/iscrb/ and it allows a party to investigate the degree to which a particular issue was briefed to the Idaho Supreme Court. When faced with an unfavorable statement in an Idaho Supreme Court decision, reviewing the briefs on the issue can be informative. For example, in Matter of Smith, the TEDRA attorney fee issue was not briefed in any detail. In fact, the only mention of TEDRA was a parenthetical citation to the statute as part of a one-line request for fees in the Respondent\u2019s Brief.[xvi] Although the Appellant opposed an award of attorney fees, the reply brief did not address TEDRA at all.[xvii] When the Supreme Court record demonstrates a lack of attention to an issue and the statement in an appellate decision mirrors the parties\u2019 lack of analysis, it is easier to ask a lower court to evaluate the issue as a matter of first impression rather than rely on an adverse stray statement in a published decision. The adversary system is premised on the parties thoroughly addressing key issues in their briefing, so a decision made without briefing is not likely to reflect the conclusion that would have been reached on full briefing and argument. 3. Appeal to Policy Implications If adverse language in an appellate decision is consistent with other precedent and was thoroughly addressed by the opposing parties, it probably doesn\u2019t matter whether there are negative policy implications of applying the stated rule to other cases. But policy implications may take on more significance if either the language conflicts with other law or if the parties failed to meaningfully brief the issue in the prior case. This is particularly true when the issue involves a matter of common law, or if the governing statute or regulation is ambiguous. Returning to the example of Matter of Smith, as discussed previously, the language requiring TEDRA be included in the pleading does not appear in the text of the statute, it runs counter to other precedent, and the issue was not briefed by the parties. As such, the policy implications of requiring TEDRA be included in a pleading may be relevant to whether the language in Matter of Smith was intended as holding or as a resolution of the issue limited to the facts in Matter of Smith. Among the aims of TEDRA is to provide \u201cnonjudicial methods for the resolution of estate and trust matters by agreement.\u201d[xviii] But a pleading rule adopted by the Supreme Court creates a perverse incentive for a party to rush to the courthouse to file a declaratory suit that either affirmatively alleges or deliberately omits an invocation of the TEDRA fee regime. Such a pleading requirement would also have the downside of creating ambiguity about what would happen if the opposing party filed a counterclaim making the opposite election (either for or against TEDRA fees) in the counterclaim. Nothing in the text of TEDRA requires the pleading rule, so even modest policy implications of such a rule could be a basis for limiting the pleading rule from Matter of Smith to the facts of that case. Conclusion Whether the language from an appellate decision is favorable or unfavorable to your client\u2019s position, it is important to evaluate the degree to which a brief statement in an appellate decision can fairly be considered as controlling precedent that governs in other cases. Establishing whether the language is necessary to a holding is the first step. But even when the language appears necessary to the outcome, there is more work that can be done to evaluate the degree to which the language was intended to control other cases beyond the one at issue. Evaluating whether there is a conflicting line of authority, whether the parties meaningfully briefed the issue, and what the policy implications would be if the rule were broadly adopted, can help lawyers make arguments for or against the broader application of a \u201cholding\u201d that received limited attention in an appellate court decision.

The substantive legal question\u2014whether a party must file a second notice of appeal after a court reopens the appeal time under FRAP 4(a)(6)\u2014is effectively settled in the petitioner's favor. The Court will not endorse the Fourth Circuit's minority position.\n\nThe new observation that the petitioner, Donte Parrish, did not file a reply brief is a critical development that directly impacts the central uncertainty of this case: the disposition. My previous belief state anticipated that the petitioner's reply would provide counter-arguments to the government's suggestion that the Court should deny certiorari and allow the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to resolve the issue.\n\nThe absence of this reply brief means the government's argument for denial now stands unopposed. The Court has been presented with a clear, judicially economical off-ramp\u2014defer to the ongoing rulemaking process\u2014and the petitioner has not offered any reason why immediate judicial intervention is necessary to correct the acknowledged 5-1 circuit split. This silence significantly strengthens the government's position on disposition.\n\nWhile the confession of error still creates strong pressure for the Court to take corrective action (a Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) or summary reversal) to avoid leaving an acknowledged error unaddressed, the petitioner's failure to file a reply makes it easier for the Court to choose denial. The scales have now tipped, increasing the probability of a denial of certiorari. The predictive puzzle is no longer just *whether* the Court will act, but whether the institutional pressure to correct a confessed error outweighs an unopposed, pragmatic argument for judicial restraint.",

Wasserman on Oct 3, 2017 October 10 will be Hamer Time at the Supreme Court. In Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, the justices will consider whether a rule limiting court-granted extensions of time to file a notice of appeal to 30 days beyond the original appeal date creates a limit on the jurisdiction of the court of appeals or is a nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule that was waived, forfeited or subject to equitable exception. Facts and legal background In 2012, Charmaine Hamer was terminated from her position as intake specialist for the Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago and Fannie Mae\u2019s Mortgage Help Center. She filed a pro se action in federal district court, alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the district court appointed counsel to represent her. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on September 14, 2015. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), Hamer had 30 days, until October 14, to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. On October 8, six days before the deadline, Hamer\u2019s counsel withdrew, requesting that the district court extend the time for filing the notice of appeal to give Hamer an opportunity to obtain appellate counsel and determine an appropriate appellate strategy. On October 9, the court entered an order granting the requested extension, giving Hamer until December 14 to file the notice of appeal. Hamer, proceeding pro se, filed the notice on December 11. The case revolves around two provisions \u2013 one a statute, one a rule of appellate procedure. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed with the court of appeals within 30 days after the entry of the judgment, order or decree; that time period constitutes a limit on the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Section 2107(c) provides that the district court may \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause,\u201d provided the motion for extension is filed not later than 30 days after expiration of the time for bringing the appeal. The district court also may reopen the time for appeal for 14 days, after making certain findings not applicable in this case. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 builds on Section 2107. Rule 4(a)(1)(A) reiterates that a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from. Rule 4(a)(5)(A) replicates Section 2107(c), requiring that a motion for extension of time be filed no later than 30 days after the time has expired and that the applicant make a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Rule 4(a)(5)(C) then states that \u201c[n]o extension \u2026 may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\u201d Hamer\u2019s appeal was timely under Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5)(A), in that the district court granted the extension on a motion filed not more than 30 days after expiration of the original time for appeal. And Hamer filed the notice of appeal before the court-ordered deadline of December 14. But the district court\u2019s order violated Rule 4(a)(5)(C), by giving Hamer more than 30 days from the original deadline to file her appeal. And Hamer\u2019s notice of appeal, although consistent with the court order, was untimely under that rule. The 7th Circuit sua sponte raised the issue of the timeliness of the appeal and its jurisdiction. After merits briefing and oral argument, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The parties present the Supreme Court with three layered questions. The first, essential, question is whether the 30-day limit on extensions of time to appeal in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional and, under long-standing Supreme Court doctrine, not subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception. If the rule is jurisdictional and mandatory, Hamer\u2019s appeal was untimely and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction. If the rule is a nonjurisdictional procedural claim-processing rule, the second question is whether it is nevertheless mandatory and not subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception. If so, Hamer\u2019s appeal was untimely and the court of appeals properly dismissed it, although not for lack of jurisdiction. If the rule is nonjurisdictional and nonmandatory, the third question is whether the untimeliness should be excused in this case because NHSC waived or forfeited any objection to the timeliness of the appeal or because the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine excuses the untimeliness. Hamer\u2019s arguments First question. Hamer argues that the 30-day limit on extensions is nonjurisdictional because it appears only in Rule 4(a)(5)(C), a court-promulgated rule, not in Section 2107(c), a congressionally enacted statute. Deadlines appearing only in court rules without statutory support do not impose jurisdictional limits. Section 2107(c) does not limit the length of an extension of time \u2013 under the statute, the court can extend the time to appeal for any period, so long as the motion was filed no later than 30 days before expiration of the original appeal deadline and the appealing party showed excusable neglect or good cause. The limit on extensions comes from Rule 4, not the statute. And the absence of a limit in the statute is intentional. Section 2107(c) provides a second exception to Section 2107(a)\u2019s 30-day appeals period, allowing the court to reopen the time to appeal when a party did not receive notice of entry of a judgment or order, but expressly limiting the time to 14 days. Although not applicable to this case, the second exception suggests that Congress knew how to set a maximum extension period, so its failure to include such a limit in the basic exception of Section 2107(c) shows an intent not to do so. In fact, Section 2107(c) previously contained the same 30-day limit as appears in Rule 4(a)(5)(C), but Congress eliminated it in 1991, removing the statutory basis for that limit, along with the argument for it being jurisdictional. The absence of a statutory basis for this time limit distinguishes this case from Bowles v. Russell, in which the nonwaivable jurisdictional time limit (for reopening the time for appeal) appeared in both Rule 4 and Section 2017(c). Second question. Hamer points to Supreme Court precedent holding that nonjurisdictional claim-processing procedural rules are not mandatory and are subject to waiver, forfeiture and equitable exception. Third question. Hamer identifies several ways in which the NHSC waived or forfeited its objection to the timeliness of the appeal. It did not object to the district court order granting the impermissible 60-day extension; it did not notice its own appeal of the order; it did not cross-appeal Hamer\u2019s appeal of the summary judgment; and it filed a joint corrected docketing statement in the 7th Circuit, twice stating that Hamer timely filed her notice of appeal. Hamer also argues for the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine to excuse her noncompliance with Rule 4(a)(5)(C), because she relied on and obeyed a noncompliant court order. Equitable exceptions to time limits are consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of nonjurisdictional time limits, its treatment of other federal rules that allow for equitable exceptions, and Section 2107(c). The housing services\u2019 arguments First question. The NHSC argues that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional in both its nature and its basis. It delineates cases within the court\u2019s authority, by defining when one court\u2019s power begins and the other court\u2019s ends. A notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests jurisdiction from the district court. Any rule that affects timeliness, including Rule 4(a)(5)(C), therefore affects jurisdiction. The rule also has a statutory basis in Section 2107(c). The 30-day limit appeared in Section 2107(c) in 1948, and it remained there in 1967, when the Rules of Appellate Procedure were adopted and the limit was reiterated in Rule 4. That statutory time limit was removed in 1991 as part of a technical amendment to bring Section 2107 into conformity with rules of appellate procedure, an amendment that added the more detailed 14-day reopening period. The Supreme Court should not interpret a technical change as a choice to strip the statute of its jurisdictional status, especially because the 30-day limit had been in the statute for decades. Second question. Even if nonjurisdictional, the NHSC argues, the 30-day limit remains mandatory and unalterable. Firm deadlines, even when nonjurisdictional, promote finality and certainty for the parties as to the next steps in litigation, while allowing untimely appeals undermines those objectives. Moreover, Rule 4(a)(5)(C) already accounts for equitable considerations, because the district court cannot grant an extension unless the appealing party shows excusable neglect or good cause. It would be inconsistent with the text to allow the court to grant an extension, limited to 30 days beyond the original deadline, only when equity requires, and then to exceed the 30-day limit, also when equity requires. Third question. The NHSC argues that none of its conduct in the district court or the court of appeals waived or forfeited its objections to the timeliness of the appeal. The motion for an extension of time was not subject to briefing in the district court, so the NHSC never had an opportunity to object to the 60-day extension. It did not know on October 9 (the date of the order granting the extension) whether Hamer would use the additional time to appeal, so there was nothing for it to appeal. And this was not an issue requiring a cross-appeal, because the NHSC did not challenge the decree that resolved the case or seek to enlarge its own rights; it only sought to dismiss an untimely appeal. The NHSC also maintains that the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine did not survive Bowles, which held that a party\u2019s reliance on an erroneous district-court time limit did not overcome the plain language of the rule. Moreover, the district court granted the 60-day extension in this case because the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawing trial counsel asked for 60 days; a party cannot claim equitable reliance on an erroneous district court order that was entered at the party\u2019s request and reflected what the party asked for. Scholarly amicus Professor Scott Dodson of UC Hastings College of the Law filed an amicus brief that urges a departure from long-standing doctrine, but provides a more coherent approach to jurisdictional questions. Dodson argues that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional because it defines the boundary between two adjudicative forums, the district court and the court of appeals, and determines where a case belongs and where it does not belong. But defining the rule as jurisdictional does not resolve the dispute. The effects of a jurisdictional rule \u2013 whether it is subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception \u2013 derive not from the definition of the rule as jurisdictional, but from whatever effects the rulemaker (Congress) or rule interpreter (the courts) want it to have. Deciding whether Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional, the point on which the Supreme Court granted review, is beside the point; what matters is whether Congress or the court wants the rule, however characterized, to be waivable or subject to judge-made exceptions.

That certainly is the case under the Michigan Court Rules. But as demonstrated by a recent decision from the United States Supreme Court, Hamer v Neighborhood Housing Serv of Chicago, ___ US ___ (Nov 8, 2017), it is not always so when it comes to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. State Court It is well established under the Michigan Court Rules that the \"time limit for an appeal of right is jurisdictional.\" MCR 7.204(A). In general, this means that an appeal of right in a civil case must be filed within 21 days of the judgment or order appealed from, MCR 7.204(A)(1)(a), or 21 days after the entry of an order denying a timely \"motion for new trial, a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, or a motion for other relief from the order or judgment appealed.\" MCR 7.204(A)(1)(b).2 If an appeal as of right is not filed in accordance with the court rules, it will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See Baitinger v Brisson, 230 Mich App 112, 113; 583 NW2d 481 (1998) (\"We dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction under MCR 7.203 because it was not filed within the period provided in MCR 7.204(A)(1).\"). Federal Court But the analysis is more nuanced under the federal rules. Generally, civil appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 must be filed \"within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\" FR App P 4(a)(1)(A). And just as under the Michigan Court Rules, the federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction over appeals that are not filed within the 30-day period. Bowles v Russell, 551 US 205, 209-210 (2007) (\"This Court has long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\"). Unlike MCR 7.204, however, Rule 4 allows the 30-day appeal period to be extended even in cases where the losing party received timely notice of the judgment.3 This is where things become somewhat complicated. Under Rule 4(a)(5), a district court \"may extend the time to file a notice of appeal\" if the losing party files a motion \"no later than 30 days after the [appeal period] expires\" and shows \"excusable neglect or good cause.\" Rule 4(a)(5) also limits the length of an extension of time to appeal to \"30 days after the [prescribed appeal period] or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\" FR App P 4(a)(5)(C). At first blush, it would seem that since the 30-day appeal period is jurisdictional, so too must be the time limit that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) places on a district court\u2019s extension of the appeal period. Not so, according to a recent decision from the United States Supreme Court. In Hamer v Neighborhood Housing Serv of Chicago, ___ US ___ (Nov 8, 2017), the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s age discrimination claims on September 14, 2015. Just before the 30-day appeal period was set to expire on October 14, 2015, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw as well to extend the time for the plaintiff to file a notice of appeal. The district court granted both motions, extending the appeal period by an additional 60 days, from October 14 to December 14, 2015. Based on that extension, the plaintiff filed her notice of appeal to the Seventh Circuit on December 11, 2015. On its own initiative, the Court of Appeals questioned the timeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and, after requesting briefing on the issue, dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. The court reasoned that since extensions of the appeal period are limited by Rule 4(a)(5)(C) to 30 days, the plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely and had to dismissed. The Supreme Court, however, reversed. The Court observed that although a district court\u2019s ability to extend the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(5) ultimately derives from 28 USC 2107(c),4 the only statutory, and hence \"jurisdictional,\" time limit placed on such extensions is in \"cases in which the appellant lacked notice of the entry of judgment.\" In those cases, the district court can reopen the appeal period for up to \"14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.\" 28 USC 2107(c)(2). But \"for other cases, the statute does not say how long an extension may run.\" Consequently, the Court held, Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s limitation on extensions of time is not a \"jurisdictional appeal filing deadline,\" but rather a \"mandatory claim-processing rule\" that is subject to \"forfeiture\" or other \"equitable considerations.\" The Court explained that only statutory time limitations affect a court\u2019s \"adjudicatory authority over the case,\" whereas mandatory claim-processing rules such as Rule 4(a)(5)(C) \"may be waived or forfeited.\" The Court concluded that because the Court of Appeals had \"erroneously treated as jurisdictional Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s 30-day limitation on extensions of time to file a notice of appeal,\" a remand was necessary for that court to determine whether the defendants\u2019 failure to object \"effected a forfeiture,\" or \"whether equitable considerations may occasion an exception to Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s time constraint.\" Conclusion Although the best practice is to follow any appeal filing deadline, regardless whether it is contained in a statute or a court rule, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hamer suggests that, at least in federal court, the failure to do so is not necessarily fatal. 1 A version of this article was previously published in the Michigan Defense Quarterly. 2 There are certain exceptions to the 21-day time period (e.g., appeals from certain agency decisions where a different time period is prescribed by statute), but they are beyond the scope of this article. 3 MCR 7.204 and Rule 4 are similar in providing for extensions of time in cases in which a party did not receive notice of the judgment. Pursuant to MCR 7.204(A)(3), \"[i]f the Court of Appeals finds that service of the judgment or order was delayed beyond the time stated in MCR 2.602 and the claim of appeal was filed within 14 days after service of the judgment or order, the claim of appeal will be deemed timely.\" Rule 4\u2019s analogous provision permits a district court to \"reopen the time to file an appeal\" if (1) the party files a motion either \"180 days after the judgment or order is entered\" or 14 days after the party received notice, whichever is earlier, and (2) \"no party would be prejudiced.\" FR App P 4(a)(6). 4 28 USC 2107(c) provides that a district court \"may, upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.\" Send Print Report Latest PostsRecent FTC Developments on Non-Compete Enforcement Motions for Reconsideration Under Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 7.1(h) No Longer Toll the Appeal Deadline Friendly PC Model: 3 Key Ancillary Agreements for CPOM Compliance QuickHits: Executive Order 14117 Comes into Force: Key Considerations for Cross-Border Data Transfers One Big Beautiful Bill Act Expands QSBS Tax Incentives for Small Business Investment See more \u00bb DISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

But the Court addressed only an important, though technical, issue about deadlines for appellate filings. Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, No. 16-658, was argued on October 10. The Supreme Court quickly turned around a unanimous decision on November 8, 2017, authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Charlaine Hamer brought a federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Under 28 U.S.C. 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), Ms. Hamer had 30 days from the entry of judgment to notice an appeal. But a few days before the 30-day deadline, Ms. Hamer\u2019s attorneys sought both to withdraw from the case due to strategic differences with the client and requested a 60-day extension of the appeal deadline so that Ms. Hamer could find new counsel for her appeal. The trial court granted both motions. Represented by new counsel, Ms. Hamer filed her appeal shortly before the extended deadline. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, questioned whether it had jurisdiction over Ms. Hamer\u2019s appeal and asked the parties to brief that issue. As the appellate court noted, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(C) limits extensions of time for noticing an appeal to no more than 30 days after the initial deadline. Federal statute\u201428 U.S.C. 2107(c)\u2014also addresses extensions, but it does not set an outer limit for their length. Here, the district court had granted Ms. Hamer a 60-day extension. The difference between the statutory text (which does not limit the length of an extension) and Rule 4(a)(5)(C) (which does) has divided appellate courts. Two circuits had deemed the limitation in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) a mandatory claims-processing rule, which means it must be followed but can be waived or forfeited such that there are circumstances where an appeal could be timely even if filed during an extension longer than the Rule countenances. Three circuits had deemed the limitation jurisdictional, which means they considered it an absolute bar to proceeding with an appeal filed after the outside limit of the rule, regardless of circumstances. In Ms. Hamer\u2019s case, the Seventh Circuit joined the jurisdictional side of this split. The Supreme Court clarified that the 30-day limitation on extensions in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional limit. The Court reiterated that limits prescribed by congressionally enacted statutes mark jurisdictional boundaries, whereas those prescribed by judicially crafted rules present mandatory claims-processing rules. Here, because the statute governing the timing of appeals\u201428 U.S.C. 2107\u2014does not itself limit the length of a potential extension, the 30-day restriction in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is not jurisdictional. While 28 U.S.C. 2107 had, prior to 1991, limited extensions of the deadline to notice an appeal to 30 days, the Supreme Court refused to speculate that Congress\u2019s deletion of that limit was inadvertent. See Hamer, slip op. at 7-8. And though a prior Supreme Court decision had stated that \u201cthe taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019\u201d Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 207 (2009) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61 (1982) (per curiam)), the Hamer Court explained that the word \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is now more carefully and precisely used. See Hamer, slip op. at 9-10. What\u2019s next? Ms. Hamer\u2019s case goes back to the Seventh Circuit. And future appellate litigants and their attorneys should proceed cautiously, recognizing that the rule allowing an extension of up to thirty days to notice an appeal is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional limitation.

Wasserman on Oct 3, 2017 October 10 will be Hamer Time at the Supreme Court. In Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, the justices will consider whether a rule limiting court-granted extensions of time to file a notice of appeal to 30 days beyond the original appeal date creates a limit on the jurisdiction of the court of appeals or is a nonjurisdictional claim-processing rule that was waived, forfeited or subject to equitable exception. Facts and legal background In 2012, Charmaine Hamer was terminated from her position as intake specialist for the Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago and Fannie Mae\u2019s Mortgage Help Center. She filed a pro se action in federal district court, alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the district court appointed counsel to represent her. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on September 14, 2015. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), Hamer had 30 days, until October 14, to appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. On October 8, six days before the deadline, Hamer\u2019s counsel withdrew, requesting that the district court extend the time for filing the notice of appeal to give Hamer an opportunity to obtain appellate counsel and determine an appropriate appellate strategy. On October 9, the court entered an order granting the requested extension, giving Hamer until December 14 to file the notice of appeal. Hamer, proceeding pro se, filed the notice on December 11. The case revolves around two provisions \u2013 one a statute, one a rule of appellate procedure. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed with the court of appeals within 30 days after the entry of the judgment, order or decree; that time period constitutes a limit on the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Section 2107(c) provides that the district court may \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause,\u201d provided the motion for extension is filed not later than 30 days after expiration of the time for bringing the appeal. The district court also may reopen the time for appeal for 14 days, after making certain findings not applicable in this case. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 builds on Section 2107. Rule 4(a)(1)(A) reiterates that a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from. Rule 4(a)(5)(A) replicates Section 2107(c), requiring that a motion for extension of time be filed no later than 30 days after the time has expired and that the applicant make a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Rule 4(a)(5)(C) then states that \u201c[n]o extension \u2026 may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\u201d Hamer\u2019s appeal was timely under Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5)(A), in that the district court granted the extension on a motion filed not more than 30 days after expiration of the original time for appeal. And Hamer filed the notice of appeal before the court-ordered deadline of December 14. But the district court\u2019s order violated Rule 4(a)(5)(C), by giving Hamer more than 30 days from the original deadline to file her appeal. And Hamer\u2019s notice of appeal, although consistent with the court order, was untimely under that rule. The 7th Circuit sua sponte raised the issue of the timeliness of the appeal and its jurisdiction. After merits briefing and oral argument, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The parties present the Supreme Court with three layered questions. The first, essential, question is whether the 30-day limit on extensions of time to appeal in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional and, under long-standing Supreme Court doctrine, not subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception. If the rule is jurisdictional and mandatory, Hamer\u2019s appeal was untimely and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction. If the rule is a nonjurisdictional procedural claim-processing rule, the second question is whether it is nevertheless mandatory and not subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception. If so, Hamer\u2019s appeal was untimely and the court of appeals properly dismissed it, although not for lack of jurisdiction. If the rule is nonjurisdictional and nonmandatory, the third question is whether the untimeliness should be excused in this case because NHSC waived or forfeited any objection to the timeliness of the appeal or because the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine excuses the untimeliness. Hamer\u2019s arguments First question. Hamer argues that the 30-day limit on extensions is nonjurisdictional because it appears only in Rule 4(a)(5)(C), a court-promulgated rule, not in Section 2107(c), a congressionally enacted statute. Deadlines appearing only in court rules without statutory support do not impose jurisdictional limits. Section 2107(c) does not limit the length of an extension of time \u2013 under the statute, the court can extend the time to appeal for any period, so long as the motion was filed no later than 30 days before expiration of the original appeal deadline and the appealing party showed excusable neglect or good cause. The limit on extensions comes from Rule 4, not the statute. And the absence of a limit in the statute is intentional. Section 2107(c) provides a second exception to Section 2107(a)\u2019s 30-day appeals period, allowing the court to reopen the time to appeal when a party did not receive notice of entry of a judgment or order, but expressly limiting the time to 14 days. Although not applicable to this case, the second exception suggests that Congress knew how to set a maximum extension period, so its failure to include such a limit in the basic exception of Section 2107(c) shows an intent not to do so. In fact, Section 2107(c) previously contained the same 30-day limit as appears in Rule 4(a)(5)(C), but Congress eliminated it in 1991, removing the statutory basis for that limit, along with the argument for it being jurisdictional. The absence of a statutory basis for this time limit distinguishes this case from Bowles v. Russell, in which the nonwaivable jurisdictional time limit (for reopening the time for appeal) appeared in both Rule 4 and Section 2017(c). Second question. Hamer points to Supreme Court precedent holding that nonjurisdictional claim-processing procedural rules are not mandatory and are subject to waiver, forfeiture and equitable exception. Third question. Hamer identifies several ways in which the NHSC waived or forfeited its objection to the timeliness of the appeal. It did not object to the district court order granting the impermissible 60-day extension; it did not notice its own appeal of the order; it did not cross-appeal Hamer\u2019s appeal of the summary judgment; and it filed a joint corrected docketing statement in the 7th Circuit, twice stating that Hamer timely filed her notice of appeal. Hamer also argues for the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine to excuse her noncompliance with Rule 4(a)(5)(C), because she relied on and obeyed a noncompliant court order. Equitable exceptions to time limits are consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of nonjurisdictional time limits, its treatment of other federal rules that allow for equitable exceptions, and Section 2107(c). The housing services\u2019 arguments First question. The NHSC argues that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional in both its nature and its basis. It delineates cases within the court\u2019s authority, by defining when one court\u2019s power begins and the other court\u2019s ends. A notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests jurisdiction from the district court. Any rule that affects timeliness, including Rule 4(a)(5)(C), therefore affects jurisdiction. The rule also has a statutory basis in Section 2107(c). The 30-day limit appeared in Section 2107(c) in 1948, and it remained there in 1967, when the Rules of Appellate Procedure were adopted and the limit was reiterated in Rule 4. That statutory time limit was removed in 1991 as part of a technical amendment to bring Section 2107 into conformity with rules of appellate procedure, an amendment that added the more detailed 14-day reopening period. The Supreme Court should not interpret a technical change as a choice to strip the statute of its jurisdictional status, especially because the 30-day limit had been in the statute for decades. Second question. Even if nonjurisdictional, the NHSC argues, the 30-day limit remains mandatory and unalterable. Firm deadlines, even when nonjurisdictional, promote finality and certainty for the parties as to the next steps in litigation, while allowing untimely appeals undermines those objectives. Moreover, Rule 4(a)(5)(C) already accounts for equitable considerations, because the district court cannot grant an extension unless the appealing party shows excusable neglect or good cause. It would be inconsistent with the text to allow the court to grant an extension, limited to 30 days beyond the original deadline, only when equity requires, and then to exceed the 30-day limit, also when equity requires. Third question. The NHSC argues that none of its conduct in the district court or the court of appeals waived or forfeited its objections to the timeliness of the appeal. The motion for an extension of time was not subject to briefing in the district court, so the NHSC never had an opportunity to object to the 60-day extension. It did not know on October 9 (the date of the order granting the extension) whether Hamer would use the additional time to appeal, so there was nothing for it to appeal. And this was not an issue requiring a cross-appeal, because the NHSC did not challenge the decree that resolved the case or seek to enlarge its own rights; it only sought to dismiss an untimely appeal. The NHSC also maintains that the equitable \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine did not survive Bowles, which held that a party\u2019s reliance on an erroneous district-court time limit did not overcome the plain language of the rule. Moreover, the district court granted the 60-day extension in this case because the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawing trial counsel asked for 60 days; a party cannot claim equitable reliance on an erroneous district court order that was entered at the party\u2019s request and reflected what the party asked for. Scholarly amicus Professor Scott Dodson of UC Hastings College of the Law filed an amicus brief that urges a departure from long-standing doctrine, but provides a more coherent approach to jurisdictional questions. Dodson argues that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional because it defines the boundary between two adjudicative forums, the district court and the court of appeals, and determines where a case belongs and where it does not belong. But defining the rule as jurisdictional does not resolve the dispute. The effects of a jurisdictional rule \u2013 whether it is subject to waiver, forfeiture or equitable exception \u2013 derive not from the definition of the rule as jurisdictional, but from whatever effects the rulemaker (Congress) or rule interpreter (the courts) want it to have. Deciding whether Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is jurisdictional, the point on which the Supreme Court granted review, is beside the point; what matters is whether Congress or the court wants the rule, however characterized, to be waivable or subject to judge-made exceptions.

That certainly is the case under the Michigan Court Rules. But as demonstrated by a recent decision from the United States Supreme Court, Hamer v Neighborhood Housing Serv of Chicago, ___ US ___ (Nov 8, 2017), it is not always so when it comes to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. State Court It is well established under the Michigan Court Rules that the \"time limit for an appeal of right is jurisdictional.\" MCR 7.204(A). In general, this means that an appeal of right in a civil case must be filed within 21 days of the judgment or order appealed from, MCR 7.204(A)(1)(a), or 21 days after the entry of an order denying a timely \"motion for new trial, a motion for rehearing or reconsideration, or a motion for other relief from the order or judgment appealed.\" MCR 7.204(A)(1)(b).2 If an appeal as of right is not filed in accordance with the court rules, it will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See Baitinger v Brisson, 230 Mich App 112, 113; 583 NW2d 481 (1998) (\"We dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction under MCR 7.203 because it was not filed within the period provided in MCR 7.204(A)(1).\"). Federal Court But the analysis is more nuanced under the federal rules. Generally, civil appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 must be filed \"within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\" FR App P 4(a)(1)(A). And just as under the Michigan Court Rules, the federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction over appeals that are not filed within the 30-day period. Bowles v Russell, 551 US 205, 209-210 (2007) (\"This Court has long held that the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\"). Unlike MCR 7.204, however, Rule 4 allows the 30-day appeal period to be extended even in cases where the losing party received timely notice of the judgment.3 This is where things become somewhat complicated. Under Rule 4(a)(5), a district court \"may extend the time to file a notice of appeal\" if the losing party files a motion \"no later than 30 days after the [appeal period] expires\" and shows \"excusable neglect or good cause.\" Rule 4(a)(5) also limits the length of an extension of time to appeal to \"30 days after the [prescribed appeal period] or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\" FR App P 4(a)(5)(C). At first blush, it would seem that since the 30-day appeal period is jurisdictional, so too must be the time limit that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) places on a district court\u2019s extension of the appeal period. Not so, according to a recent decision from the United States Supreme Court. In Hamer v Neighborhood Housing Serv of Chicago, ___ US ___ (Nov 8, 2017), the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s age discrimination claims on September 14, 2015. Just before the 30-day appeal period was set to expire on October 14, 2015, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw as well to extend the time for the plaintiff to file a notice of appeal. The district court granted both motions, extending the appeal period by an additional 60 days, from October 14 to December 14, 2015. Based on that extension, the plaintiff filed her notice of appeal to the Seventh Circuit on December 11, 2015. On its own initiative, the Court of Appeals questioned the timeliness of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and, after requesting briefing on the issue, dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. The court reasoned that since extensions of the appeal period are limited by Rule 4(a)(5)(C) to 30 days, the plaintiff\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely and had to dismissed. The Supreme Court, however, reversed. The Court observed that although a district court\u2019s ability to extend the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(5) ultimately derives from 28 USC 2107(c),4 the only statutory, and hence \"jurisdictional,\" time limit placed on such extensions is in \"cases in which the appellant lacked notice of the entry of judgment.\" In those cases, the district court can reopen the appeal period for up to \"14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.\" 28 USC 2107(c)(2). But \"for other cases, the statute does not say how long an extension may run.\" Consequently, the Court held, Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s limitation on extensions of time is not a \"jurisdictional appeal filing deadline,\" but rather a \"mandatory claim-processing rule\" that is subject to \"forfeiture\" or other \"equitable considerations.\" The Court explained that only statutory time limitations affect a court\u2019s \"adjudicatory authority over the case,\" whereas mandatory claim-processing rules such as Rule 4(a)(5)(C) \"may be waived or forfeited.\" The Court concluded that because the Court of Appeals had \"erroneously treated as jurisdictional Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s 30-day limitation on extensions of time to file a notice of appeal,\" a remand was necessary for that court to determine whether the defendants\u2019 failure to object \"effected a forfeiture,\" or \"whether equitable considerations may occasion an exception to Rule 4(a)(5)(C)\u2019s time constraint.\" Conclusion Although the best practice is to follow any appeal filing deadline, regardless whether it is contained in a statute or a court rule, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hamer suggests that, at least in federal court, the failure to do so is not necessarily fatal. 1 A version of this article was previously published in the Michigan Defense Quarterly. 2 There are certain exceptions to the 21-day time period (e.g., appeals from certain agency decisions where a different time period is prescribed by statute), but they are beyond the scope of this article. 3 MCR 7.204 and Rule 4 are similar in providing for extensions of time in cases in which a party did not receive notice of the judgment. Pursuant to MCR 7.204(A)(3), \"[i]f the Court of Appeals finds that service of the judgment or order was delayed beyond the time stated in MCR 2.602 and the claim of appeal was filed within 14 days after service of the judgment or order, the claim of appeal will be deemed timely.\" Rule 4\u2019s analogous provision permits a district court to \"reopen the time to file an appeal\" if (1) the party files a motion either \"180 days after the judgment or order is entered\" or 14 days after the party received notice, whichever is earlier, and (2) \"no party would be prejudiced.\" FR App P 4(a)(6). 4 28 USC 2107(c) provides that a district court \"may, upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.\" Send Print Report Latest PostsRecent FTC Developments on Non-Compete Enforcement Motions for Reconsideration Under Eastern District of Michigan Local Rule 7.1(h) No Longer Toll the Appeal Deadline Friendly PC Model: 3 Key Ancillary Agreements for CPOM Compliance QuickHits: Executive Order 14117 Comes into Force: Key Considerations for Cross-Border Data Transfers One Big Beautiful Bill Act Expands QSBS Tax Incentives for Small Business Investment See more \u00bb DISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations.

But the Court addressed only an important, though technical, issue about deadlines for appellate filings. Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, No. 16-658, was argued on October 10. The Supreme Court quickly turned around a unanimous decision on November 8, 2017, authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Charlaine Hamer brought a federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Under 28 U.S.C. 2107(a) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A), Ms. Hamer had 30 days from the entry of judgment to notice an appeal. But a few days before the 30-day deadline, Ms. Hamer\u2019s attorneys sought both to withdraw from the case due to strategic differences with the client and requested a 60-day extension of the appeal deadline so that Ms. Hamer could find new counsel for her appeal. The trial court granted both motions. Represented by new counsel, Ms. Hamer filed her appeal shortly before the extended deadline. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, questioned whether it had jurisdiction over Ms. Hamer\u2019s appeal and asked the parties to brief that issue. As the appellate court noted, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(C) limits extensions of time for noticing an appeal to no more than 30 days after the initial deadline. Federal statute\u201428 U.S.C. 2107(c)\u2014also addresses extensions, but it does not set an outer limit for their length. Here, the district court had granted Ms. Hamer a 60-day extension. The difference between the statutory text (which does not limit the length of an extension) and Rule 4(a)(5)(C) (which does) has divided appellate courts. Two circuits had deemed the limitation in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) a mandatory claims-processing rule, which means it must be followed but can be waived or forfeited such that there are circumstances where an appeal could be timely even if filed during an extension longer than the Rule countenances. Three circuits had deemed the limitation jurisdictional, which means they considered it an absolute bar to proceeding with an appeal filed after the outside limit of the rule, regardless of circumstances. In Ms. Hamer\u2019s case, the Seventh Circuit joined the jurisdictional side of this split. The Supreme Court clarified that the 30-day limitation on extensions in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional limit. The Court reiterated that limits prescribed by congressionally enacted statutes mark jurisdictional boundaries, whereas those prescribed by judicially crafted rules present mandatory claims-processing rules. Here, because the statute governing the timing of appeals\u201428 U.S.C. 2107\u2014does not itself limit the length of a potential extension, the 30-day restriction in Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is not jurisdictional. While 28 U.S.C. 2107 had, prior to 1991, limited extensions of the deadline to notice an appeal to 30 days, the Supreme Court refused to speculate that Congress\u2019s deletion of that limit was inadvertent. See Hamer, slip op. at 7-8. And though a prior Supreme Court decision had stated that \u201cthe taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019\u201d Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 207 (2009) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61 (1982) (per curiam)), the Hamer Court explained that the word \u201cjurisdictional\u201d is now more carefully and precisely used. See Hamer, slip op. at 9-10. What\u2019s next? Ms. Hamer\u2019s case goes back to the Seventh Circuit. And future appellate litigants and their attorneys should proceed cautiously, recognizing that the rule allowing an extension of up to thirty days to notice an appeal is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional limitation.

The substantive legal question\u2014whether a party must refile a notice of appeal after the appeal time is reopened under FRAP 4(a)(6)\u2014is not in serious dispute, and the Court will not affirm the Fourth Circuit's minority view, which created a 5-1 circuit split.\n\nThe central uncertainty continues to be the case's disposition. The petitioner's failure to file a reply brief left the government's recommendation to deny certiorari and defer to the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules unopposed. This created a significant pull towards denial, offering the Court a pragmatic and judicially economical path.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014a search for precedents on this exact procedural posture\u2014adds a new layer to this understanding. The search for \"Supreme Court practice when Solicitor General confesses error but recommends denying certiorari pending rulemaking by the Advisory Committee\" did not yield any directly relevant case law or established procedural script. The documents found were either abstract legal theory on stare decisis, irrelevant to federal appellate procedure, or general advice for litigators.\n\nThis absence of a clear, established practice is itself a critical piece of information. It signals that the Court is not bound by a specific procedural playbook in this scenario. The decision on disposition is likely to be highly discretionary. Without a precedent where the Court has previously rejected the SG's advice to deny pending rulemaking in favor of an immediate GVR or summary reversal, the argument for denial is strengthened. The unopposed, practical off-ramp suggested by the SG is not contradicted by any known Court practice. While the pressure to correct a confessed error is real, the lack of a procedural mandate to do so, combined with the petitioner's silence and an available alternative (the rulemaking process), makes denial the most probable outcome. The failure to find a counter-example solidifies the factors pointing toward denial.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal merits is now exceptionally strong, and my belief about the case's likely disposition has shifted significantly towards summary action by the Court.\n\nThe foundational belief that the Fourth Circuit erred remains, reinforced by the Solicitor General's confession of error. The Court will not affirm the minority view that created a 5-1 circuit split. The primary uncertainty has always been the disposition: would the Court deny certiorari as the SG recommended, or would it take action to correct the error? Previously, the petitioner's failure to file a reply brief, combined with the lack of a clear precedent for how the Court handles an SG's recommendation to deny pending rulemaking, made denial seem the most probable, judicially economical outcome.\n\nThe latest observation, while failing to find information on the Advisory Committee's current work, has unearthed a critical and highly relevant precedent: the Supreme Court's 2017 unanimous decision in *Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago*. This case is a powerful signal. In *Hamer*, the Court clarified the distinction between jurisdictional requirements, which are prescribed by statute, and mandatory claim-processing rules, which are prescribed by judicially crafted rules like the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The Court held that rule-based time limits are non-jurisdictional and can be subject to waiver, forfeiture, or equitable considerations.\n\nThis precedent directly informs the legal question in *Parrish*. The Fourth Circuit's requirement that a petitioner must file a *second* notice of appeal after their appeal time is reopened under FRAP 4(a)(6) is a judicial gloss on a procedural rule, not a command from a statute. Therefore, under the clear logic of *Hamer*, treating this requirement as \"jurisdictional\" and dismissing the appeal was an error. The *Hamer* decision moves my belief about the merits from \"highly confident\" (based on the SG's confession) to \"near certain.\" The Fourth Circuit's ruling is not just part of a circuit split; it is in direct tension with the principles of a recent, unanimous Supreme Court decision.\n\nThis new understanding fundamentally alters my prediction of the disposition. The existence of *Hamer* provides the Court with a perfect, low-effort tool to resolve this case: a Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) order instructing the Fourth Circuit to reconsider its decision in light of *Hamer*. This is a common procedure for correcting clear errors that conflict with existing precedent. It is far more efficient than waiting for the Advisory Committee to amend a rule when the Court has already provided the analytical framework to solve the problem. The argument for denying certiorari has been substantially weakened. While the petitioner's silence is still a factor, the clarity of the Fourth Circuit's error in the face of *Hamer* creates a strong impetus for the Court to intervene and summarily correct it. The most likely outcome is no longer denial, but a GVR.",
