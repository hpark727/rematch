    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2009, Corey Deyon Duffey, Jarvis Dupree Ross, and Tony R. Hewitt were convicted of multiple counts of conspiracy, attempted bank robbery, bank robbery, and using firearms in furtherance of these crimes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). After appeals and resentencing, they received mandatory minimum sentences of 5 years for their first \u00a7 924(c) conviction and 25 years for each subsequent conviction, as per the law at that time which allowed \u201cstacking\u201d of these charges.\n\nIn 2020, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Davis, the appellants successfully filed for habeas relief. The district court vacated their \u00a7 924(c) conspiracy convictions and ordered resentencing. Before their resentencing in 2022, the appellants argued that \u00a7 403 of the First Step Act of 2018, which eliminated sentence stacking for \u00a7 924(c) convictions, should apply to their cases. The government initially opposed this view but later changed its position to support the application of \u00a7 403. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected their challenges and affirmed the convictions.",

While it doesn't acquire new external information, it synthesizes the initial problem statement into a coherent and effective strategy. \n\nTask EIG is high (0.8) because the thought process correctly identifies the central legal question (statutory interpretation of the First Step Act), pinpoints the most critical information sources (briefs), and notes a highly significant signal (the government changing its position). This dramatically reduces uncertainty about *how to proceed* to solve this specific task, setting up a series of high-value subsequent actions. \n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because the articulated strategy\u2014identify the core issue, plan to read primary briefs, and weigh the Solicitor General's stance\u2014is a fundamental and generalizable workflow for SCOTUS prediction. Validating this planning approach is valuable for improving the agent's overall methodology. \n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action is a strong move for both the immediate task and for refining the agent's long-term strategy.",

This is a massive gain in information for the task, as it allows me to move from predicting 'who' will win to 'why' they will win, which is essential for a complete judgment prediction. The Task EIG is therefore very high. For Design EIG, this action reinforces the fundamental strategy of analyzing primary source legal arguments. It also provides a valuable data point on how to model cases involving a confession of error, helping to refine the general strategy for this specific but important scenario. While it's a standard step, its value in this context is significant, leading to a moderate Design EIG. The combined value is high.",

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n28: 20240916164055634_Hewitt20mertis20brief20cert20of20compliance20FINAL.json (score: 0.453)\nNos. 23-1002 & 23-1150 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n \nTony R.

App. 1a-16a) is pub-\nlished at 92 F.4th 304. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered judgment on February 2, \n2024. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on \nMarch 8, 2024, which the Court granted on July 2, 2024. \nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nThe relevant provisions of the First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, 132 Stat. 5194, are reproduced in the \npetition appendix at pages 17a-21a. \nINTRODUCTION \nSection 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code authorizes \ndrastic mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ncommit certain federal crimes while carrying, brandish-\ning, or discharging a firearm. For first offenses, it calls for \na mandatory minimum sentence between five and ten \nyears\u2019 imprisonment. For second or subsequent offenses, \nthat number jumps to 25 years. The statute requires that \nthe sentence for each section 924(c) count run consecu-\ntively with any other sentence. \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt held that section 924(c), as originally enacted, \nrequired imposition of the 25-year mandatory minimum if \na defendant was convicted of multiple section 924(c) \ncounts in a single criminal proceeding. Thus, even a first-\ntime offender, if charged with multiple section 924(c) \ncounts, could face multiple 25-year sentences, running \nconsecutively. This effect, which often resulted in de facto \nlife sentences for first-time offenders, came to be known \nas \u201cstacking.\u201d \nStacking was widely regarded as unjust and irration-\nal. As one district court noted, a first-time, nonviolent \noffender who carried a firearm during a string of simple \n\n2 \n \ndrug sales would face more prison time than a murderer. \nCongress finally answered the calls for corrective action \nwith the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA). A principal aim of \nthe law was to end stacking. To that end, section 403(a) \nof the FSA amended section 924(c) to abrogate Deal, so \nthat the statute now permits enhanced sentences only \n\u201c[i]n the case of a violation of this subsection that occurs \nafter a prior conviction under this subsection has become \nfinal.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As a result, now only true \nrecidivists may be sentenced to section 924(c)\u2019s enhan-\nced 25-year mandatory minimum. \nBut under 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the default rule for such \nsentencing reforms is that they apply only to crimes com-\nmitted after enactment. Appreciating the grave injustice \nthat would result if stacking were allowed to continue in \npost-enactment sentencings for pre-enactment conduct, \nCongress overrode the default rule, making section \n403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform retroactive. It thus adopted \nsection 403(b), which specifies that section 403(a) \u201cshall \napply to any offense that was committed before the date \nof enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d  \nAll agree that this language makes section 403(a) \nrelief available to a defendant who committed an offense \npre-enactment but is sentenced post-enactment. All also \nagree that it does not make relief available to anyone who \ncommitted an offense pre-enactment and whose sentence \nand judgment of conviction were final on the date of \nenactment and remain so today. The only question here is \nwhether it makes section 403(a) relief available to a \ndefendant who was sentenced pre-enactment, but whose \ninitial sentence was thereafter vacated, rendering the \ninitial sentence void ab initio and necessitating post-\nenactment plenary resentencing. \nThe plain text of section 403(b) supplies the answer: \nIt does. As a starting point, \u201ca sentence for the offense\u201d \n\n3 \n \ndoes not\u2014cannot\u2014include a sentence that has been \nvacated. A vacated sentence is a nullity, one treated by \noperation of law as never having been imposed. The point \nof vacatur is to ensure that the object has no legal effect \nand works no ongoing prejudice. Congress is presumed to \nunderstand and incorporate background legal principles \nlike this and thus could not have intended \u201ca sentence\u201d to \ninclude a vacated sentence. \nThis is confirmed by the statutory context, including \nthe verb tense and preposition that Congress used. The \npresent-perfect tense, used together with the preposition \n\u201cas of,\u201d indicates that Congress sought to deny section \n403(a)\u2019s reforms only to those defendants whose judg-\nments of conviction were final on the date of enactment \nand remain so today. As the government now agrees, no \nordinary English speaker would say that a sentence \u201chas \nbeen imposed as of December 21, 2018\u201d if the sentence \nwas vacated and no longer has any force or effect.  \nReading section 403(b) as drawing a line between \npending and past cases reflects Congress\u2019s evident desire \nto respect the finality of judgments. But finality is not an \nissue when a judgment is vacated for reasons independent \nof the FSA; such a case is \u201cpending\u201d like any other. That \nis confirmed by post-vacatur practice, which calls for an \nentirely new, de novo proceeding at which Congress could \nnot have intended stacking to remain available.  \nNone of the contrary rationales supplied by the court \nbelow or by the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits is persuasive. \nThose courts\u2019 rationales would revise the statute\u2019s \nlanguage and blinder the Court to the statute\u2019s context, \nstructure, and manifest purpose, reading section 403(b) \nto defeat Congress\u2019s design rather than to conform to it. \nThis Court\u2019s cases require no such result. If there were \nany doubt about that, the rule of lenity would require \nresolving it in petitioner\u2019s favor and thus reversing the \ndecision below. \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Section 924(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code crim-\ninalizes the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm in \nconnection with a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking \ncrime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).  \nConviction for a first section 924(c) violation carries \na mandatory minimum sentence of five years for offenders \nwho carry or possess a firearm during a crime of violence \nor a drug trafficking crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). \nAs originally enacted and through December 21, 2018, a \nconviction for a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d 924(c) violation \ncarried a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Moreover, when a defendant is convicted \nof violating section 924(c), the statute\u2019s mandatory \nminimum sentence must run consecutively rather than \nconcurrently \u201cwith any other term of imprisonment.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  \nIn Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), the \nCourt interpreted section 924(c)\u2019s \u201csecond or subse-\nquent\u201d language to apply to multiple 924(c) convictions \nobtained in a single criminal proceeding. See 508 U.S. at \n134 (rejecting the contention that that section \u201c924(c)(1) \nmust be read to impose the enhanced sentence only for an \noffense committed after a previous sentence has become \nfinal\u201d). In other words, according to the Court, a \ndefendant could commit an initial and \u201csubsequent\u201d \noffense as part of a single criminal transaction prosecuted \nin a single case. The Court thus rejected the notion that \nsection 924(c) was intended to punish only recidivists \nand held that a defendant with no prior criminal history \ncould receive enhanced, consecutive sentences for each \nsection 924(c) count charged. Ibid. \nGiven its lengthy minimum consecutive penalties, \nsection 924(c) threatened exceptionally \u201clong prison sen-\n\n5 \n \ntences for anyone who uses a firearm in connection with \ncertain other federal crimes.\u201d United States v. Davis, 588 \nU.S. 445, 448 (2019). The practice of \u201ccharging multiple \nviolations of section 924(c) within the same indictment\u201d \nbecame known as \u201cstacking.\u201d See U.S. Sentencing Com-\nmission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearm \nOffenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 271 (Oct. \n2011) (hereinafter USSC Report). Because each count \nbeyond the first was subject to the enhanced 25-year \nminimum penalty, stacking often resulted in de facto life \nsentences for first-time section 924(c) offenders\u2014often \nseveral hundred years\u2019 imprisonment imposed all at once. \nAs one court noted, a first-time offender frequently would \nreceive a lighter sentence \u201cif he had committed murder\u201d \nrather than a series of nonviolent drug sales while carry-\ning a firearm. United States v. Holloway, 68 F. Supp. 3d \n310, 313 (E.D.N.Y. 2014). \nStacking was widely criticized as unjust. District \njudges\u2014those on the front lines of the federal criminal \njustice system\u2014objected to having to impose what they \nviewed as drastic and disproportionate sentences for first-\ntime (and often nonviolent) offenders. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Angelos, 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230-33 (D. Utah \n2004) (having to sentence the defendant, a \u201ctwenty-four-\nyear-old first offender who is a successful music execu-\ntive with two young children,\u201d to \u201cprison for the rest of \nhis life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational\u201d). \nCircuit judges likewise expressed great discomfort \nhaving to affirm \u201cirrational, inhumane, and absurd\u201d \nsentences that were \u201ca predictable by-product of the cruel \nand unjust mandatory minimum sentencing scheme \nadopted by Congress.\u201d United States v. Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d 1113, 1118 (9th Cir. 2006) (Reinhardt, J., con-\ncurring); see also, e.g., United States v. Hunter, 770 F.3d \n740, 746-747 (8th Cir. 2014) (Bright, J., concurring) \n(decrying the sentence imposed as \u201cout of this world\u201d and \n\n6 \n \n\u201cjoin[ing] in the litany of criticisms directed towards\u201d the \n\u201coverly harsh\u201d practice of sentence stacking). \nJudges and commentators observed that, beyond the \nundue harshness of mandatory minimum sentences, the \nlaw also produced wildly divergent sentencing outcomes \nbased on mere geography\u2014prosecutors in some jurisdic-\ntions used stacking as a matter of course, while others \nmore often avoided it. See In re Hernandez, 857 F.3d \n1162, 1169 (11th Cir. 2017) (Martin, J., concurring) \n(explaining that the defendant \u201cmight never have \nreceived this sentence if he had been sentenced in another \npart of the country\u201d). And prosecutors frequently used \nthe threat of stacked sentences to induce defendants to \naccept plea deals, thus forfeiting their Sixth Amendment \nright to a jury trial, adding constitutional insult to \nstatutory injury. See Human Rights Watch, An Offer You \nCan\u2019t Refuse: How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug \nDefendants to Plead Guilty (2013). \nAmong those calling for reform was the Sentencing \nCommission itself. USSC Report 359-362. In a report to \nCongress, the Commission explained that \u201c[t]he \u2018stack-\ning\u2019 of mandatory minimum penalties for multiple viola-\ntions of section 924(c) results in excessively severe and \nunjust sentences in some cases.\u201d Id. at 359. In many of \nthose cases, \u201cthe offense did not involve any physical \nharm or threat of physical harm to a person.\u201d Ibid. The \nCommission noted that the Judicial Conference had, on \nmultiple occasions, urged Congress \u201cto amend the \n\u2018draconian\u2019 penalties established at section 924(c).\u201d Id. \nat 360-361 (quoting Mandatory Minimums and Unin-\ntended Consequences: Hearing on H.R. 2934, H.R. 834, \nand H.R. 1466 Before the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security of the House Commit-\ntee on the Judiciary, 111th Cong. 35 (2009)); see also \nHearing Before the Over-Criminalization Task Force of \n2014 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 113th \n\n7 \n \nCong. 23 (2014) (testimony of Hon. Irene M. Keeley, \nJudicial Conference of the United States). \n2. Although it took several attempts over nearly a \ndecade, Congress finally heeded the Sentencing Commis-\nsion\u2019s call to action in 2018. Late that year, it enacted and \nPresident Trump signed the First Step Act, which was the \n\u201cproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort.\u201d United States \nv. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. 2020). The \nculmination of work by an \u201cextraordinary political coali-\ntion\u201d (164 Cong. Rec. S7645 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(statement of Sen. Durbin)), the FSA made \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration reforms to America\u2019s prison and sentencing \nsystem\u201d (Senate Passes Landmark Criminal Justice \nReform, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (Dec. \n18, 2018)). \nSection 403 of the FSA addresses sentence stacking. \nIts well-recognized purpose is \u201cto remedy past over-\nzealous use of mandatory-minimum sentences\u201d under \nsection 924(c). Henry, 983 F.3d at 218. To that end, \nsection 403(a) amends section 924(c) to clarify that the \n25-year mandatory minimum sentence applies only for \nviolations \u201coccur[ing] after a prior\u201d section 924(c) \nconviction \u201chas become final,\u201d effectively overruling \nDeal. See Oversight Hearing on the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and Implementation of the First Step Act: Hearing \nBefore the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Home-\nland Security of the House Committee on the Judiciary, \n116th Cong. 2 (2019) (statement of Rep. Karen Bass) \n(describing section 403 as \u201celiminat[ing] the ability to \nstack firearm enhancements within the same indictment, \nwhich has historically resulted in excessive sentences\u201d).  \nWithout stacked 25-year sentences, first-time offen-\nders convicted of multiple violations of section 924(c) at \nonce will receive consecutive five-year minimum sen-\ntences, rather than one five-year sentence and one or more \n25-year sentences.  \n\n8 \n \n3. By default, a change in sentencing law is prospec-\ntive only. That is so by statute\u20141 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 specifies \nthat a \u201cnew criminal statute [that amends or repeals] an \nolder criminal statute shall not change the penalties \n\u2018incurred\u2019 under that older statute \u2018unless the repealing \nAct shall so expressly provide.\u2019\u201d Dorsey v. United States, \n567 U.S. 260, 272 (2012) (quoting 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109). For \nthis purpose, \u201cpenalties are \u2018incurred\u2019 under the older \nstatute when an offender * * * commits the underlying \nconduct that makes the offender liable.\u201d Ibid. \nBut by late 2018, Congress knew well how wide-\nspread and problematic sentence stacking had become. \nLawmakers thus added section 403(b) to the FSA. It \nspecifies that section 403(a)\u2019s amendment of section \n924(c) shall apply not only to future offenders, but also to \npast offenders whose criminal cases remain pending: \nApplicability to Pending Cases.\u2014This sec-\ntion, and the amendments made by this section, \nshall apply to any offense that was committed \nbefore the date of enactment of this Act, if a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as \nof such date of enactment. \nCongress thus extended section 403(a) relief to all crim-\ninal defendants whose sentence \u201chas not been imposed as \nof\u201d December 21, 2018.1  \nIn contrast, Congress did not make section 403(a) a \nbasis for reducing the sentence of a defendant whose case \nwas and remains subject to a final criminal judgment. \nInstead, it provided limited alternative relief through \n \n1  Section 401, which reduces mandatory minimum sentences for \nvarious federal drug offenses, uses identical language. Because \nsections 403(b) and 401(c) use the same language, the lower courts \n\u201chave construed them to have the same meaning.\u201d United States v. \nBethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. 2021); accord United \nStates v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 389 (3d Cir. 2022). \n\n9 \n \nsection 404 to \u201cdefendants previously sentenced\u201d in a \nfinal judgment, which this Court addressed three Terms \nago in Concepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 404 authorizes \nsentence-reduction motions, which are a more limited \nform of sentencing relief than plenary resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. \n817, 830 (2010).  \nB. Factual and procedural background \n1. Petitioner Tony Hewitt and his co-defendants \nwere convicted on various charges relating to a series of \nbank robberies in 2008. The district court originally \nsentenced Hewitt to 355 years of imprisonment, the bulk \nof which corresponded to a number of stacked section \n924(c) counts. United States v. Duffey, 456 F. App\u2019x 434, \n438-439 (5th Cir. 2012); Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, \nDkt. 374 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2010). The Fifth Circuit \nreversed the convictions in part and vacated Hewitt\u2019s \nsentence due to an error not relevant here. Duffey, 456 F. \nApp\u2019x at 444. On remand, the district court resentenced \nHewitt to 305 years\u2014275 years of which corresponded to \nmandatory 25-year consecutive sentences for second or \nsubsequent 924(c) convictions. The Fifth Circuit af-\nfirmed. United States v. Ross, 582 F. App\u2019x 528, 530 (5th \nCir. 2014); Amended Judgment, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. \n524 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2012).  \nIn 2019\u2014after the FSA\u2019s enactment\u2014this Court \nheld that section 924(c)\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is uncon-\nstitutionally vague. Davis, 588 U.S. at 448. Following \nDavis, conspiracy-based charges no longer support \nconvictions under section 924(c). Given that several of \nHewitt\u2019s convictions were predicated on conspiracy to \ncommit bank robbery, Hewitt moved the Fifth Circuit for \nauthorization to file a successive section 2255 habeas \npetition. Pet. App. 3a. The Fifth Circuit granted leave. \n\n10 \n \nIbid. The district court, in turn, vacated the conspiracy-\nbased section 924(c) convictions, vacated the sentence on \nthe \nremaining \nconvictions, \nand \nordered \nplenary \nresentencing. Ibid.  \n2. The case returned to the district court for de novo \nresentencing, but the new presentence report prepared in \nHewitt\u2019s case did not account for section 403(a)\u2019s inter-\nvening amendment of section 924(c). Pet. App. 3a-4a. \nHewitt thus objected to the report, arguing that section \n403(a) should apply. Ibid. The difference, he observed, \nwas substantial: Under the law in place at the time of his \noriginal sentencing, his minimum sentence for the re-\nmaining section 924(c) counts would be 105 years, still \neffectively a life sentence. Under section 403(a) of the \nFSA, the combined mandatory minimum is 25 years.  \nHewitt\u2019s co-defendants raised the same objections. \nAs to them, the government took the position that section \n403 was inapplicable on resentencing because the initial \nsentence for each had been imposed before the FSA\u2019s date \nof enactment. But by the time of Hewitt\u2019s resentencing, \nthe government had reversed its course and requested \napplication of section 403(a) at Hewitt\u2019s resentencing. \nSee Sentencing Tr., No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 785 at 19:8-16 \n(N.D. Tex. Jan. 17, 2023). \nThe district court rejected Hewitt\u2019s and the \ngovernment\u2019s position. Id. at 22:18-23:5. The court \nreasoned that even when a sentence has been vacated, \n\u201cit\u2019s not vacated for purposes of the statute.\u201d Id. at \n22:25-23:1. It thus held that section 403(a) does not \napply and sentenced Hewitt to a 165-year term of im-\nprisonment, 105 of which corresponded to stacked \nsection 924(c) sentences. Pet. App. 5a; see Judgment on \nResentencing, No. 3:08-cv-167, Dkt. 780 (N.D. Tex. Nov. \n8, 2022).  \n\n11 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. See Pet. App. 1a-16a. \nBefore the court of appeals, Hewitt and the government \nagain both argued that section 403(a) should apply at \nresentencing following the judicial vacatur of a pre-FSA \nsentence. Pet. App. 7a. The Fifth Circuit nonetheless con-\ncluded that section 403(b) bars relief for Hewitt and his \ncodefendants. Pet. App. 6a. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the phrase \n\u201chas not been imposed\u201d is an example of \u201cpresent-perfect \ntense,\u201d the court focused predominantly on the word \n\u201cimposed.\u201d Pet. App. 7a. It reasoned that whether a \nsentence has been imposed \u201cappears to hinge on a district \ncourt\u2019s action or inaction\u201d as a singular point in time, and \n\u201cnot on a defendant\u2019s status.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. It thus held \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s focus is on the one-time historical \nfact of a sentence\u2019s imposition. Ibid. Because Hewitt had \nbeen sentenced before the FSA\u2019s enactment as a matter of \nhistorical fact, it held relief under section 403(a) was \nunavailable. Ibid. \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[i]f Congress meant for the \nFirst Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar to apply only to valid \nsentences, it could easily have said so.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. And \nit rejected Hewitt\u2019s arguments to the contrary, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he mere observation that the statutory language \ncould be made clearer does not make it unclear in the first \nplace.\u201d Id. at 9a (quoting United States v. Jackson, 995 \nF.3d 522, 526 (6th Cir. 2021)). \nThe Fifth Circuit held further that \u201cvacatur has no \neffect\u201d on the outcome of the case. Pet. App. 9a. That \nconclusion was justified, the court explained, because \n\u201cotherwise, one who, as here, has been in prison for over \na decade serving later-vacated sentences would nonethe-\nless qualify\u201d for a more lenient sentence at resentencing \nunder the FSA. Pet. App. 9a-10a. The court referred to 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g), which requires use of the guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing \n\n12 \n \nof the defendant prior to the appeal\u201d for resentencing, \nwhich it characterized as giving continuing effect to \ninitial sentences that have been vacated. Id. at 10a. On \nthose grounds, the court affirmed. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPursuant to section 403(b) of the FSA, section 403(a) \napplies to a defendant who committed an offense and was \nconvicted and sentenced pre-enactment, but whose initial \nconviction and sentence have been vacated, necessitating \na post-enactment de novo resentencing.  \nA.1. The question here is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d to include a sentence that was \npronounced before that date but later vacated. It could not \nhave done so. Congress drafts and enacts statutes against \nbackground legal principles, the content of which is \npresumptively incorporated into the meaning of the words \nit uses. As relevant here, the law treats a sentence that has \nbeen vacated as a nullity ab initio, as if it never existed. \nCases from before the Founding and consistently through \ntoday confirm that when an order or judgment is vacated, \nthe status quo ante is restored, and it is as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.  \nCongress is presumed to have known that settled \nlegal principle and, absent a contrary indication, to have \nincorporated it in the FSA. A sentence that has been \nvacated therefore cannot be \u201ca sentence for the offense,\u201d \nbecause a sentence that has been vacated does not exist. \nIt therefore cannot be ground to deny substantive relief at \nresentencing. \n2. Some lower courts have reasoned that to focus on \nthe invalidation ab initio of a vacated judgment is to add \nwords to section 403(b), effectively inserting the word \n\u201cvalid\u201d in front of the word \u201csentence.\u201d That reading has \nmatters backward. Again, the Court must presume that \nCongress incorporates settled legal principles into the \n\n13 \n \nstatutes it enacts. It therefore does not add words to the \nstatute to presume the word \u201csentence\u201d means a sentence \nthat has not been vacated. On the contrary, to read \u201ca \nsentence\u201d in section 403(b) to include a vacated sentence \nwould be to read it as \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can original \nsentence.\u201d Such modifiers would be necessary to displace \nthe background rule that the law treats a sentence that \nhas been vacated as though it never existed. But Congress \ndid not include those words. \n3. Other courts have held that section 403(b) refers \nonly to the historical fact of a past pronouncement and \nthat a vacatur does not change the past. That is wrong \ntwice over. First, vacatur does change the past by opera-\ntion of law\u2014cases from time immemorial stand for the \nproposition that when an order is vacated, it as though the \nproceeding that produced the order never happened. That \nis why the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial \nafter a conviction is vacated on appeal. \nSecond, section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pronouncement. \nCongress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense and the \npreposition \u201cas of\u201d confirm so. Use of the present-perfect \ntense implies concern with a time-span beginning in the \npast and extending up to now. And the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \nis used to indicate a time or date from which something \ncontinues. Together, they indicate that Congress was \nconcerned only with sentences that were pronounced pre-\nenactment and remain in force and effect today.  \nCommon English usage confirms the point. No one \nwould say that Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-vacated sentence \n\u201chas been imposed as of December 21, 2018,\u201d because it \nhas no continuing force or effect. If one wanted to refer to \nthe fact of a vacated sentence having been pronounced, \none would use the simple past tense and a preposition \nindicating a singular point in time: Hewitt\u2019s initial, since-\nvacated sentence was imposed before December 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nIndeed, Congress used just that formulation in section \n404, concerning sentencing modifications. That it did so \nthere but not in section 403(b) must be taken as inten-\ntional.  \n4. Statutory interpretation turns on ordinary, con-\ntemporary, and common use of the English language. \nThus, while rules of grammar and dictionary definitions \nare centrally important, the outcome cannot be \ndetermined by a single phrase scrutinized in the abstract. \nThe Court must look to the relevant language in its full \ncontext, with an eye to the statute\u2019s overall objective. \nOnly our interpretation is consistent with the FSA\u2019s \nbroader context, design, and purpose. Section 403(b) \nreflects a clear purpose: to make section 403(a)\u2019s amelior-\native sentencing reform available retroactively in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of valid criminal \njudgments. That line is sensible. Allowing application in \npending cases ensures that no court ever again engages in \nsentencing stacking, while at the same time respecting \nthe importance of the principle of finality to criminal \njustice and sound judicial administration. \nPlenary resentencings following full vacaturs are \n\u201cpending\u201d cases like any other; there is no sentence for \nthe defendant to serve, and a new one must be imposed by \nexercise of de novo judicial discretion. In that context, \napplication of section 403(a) would do nothing to disturb \nthe finality of an already-vacated judgment. Applying \nsection 403(a) to such cases is thus consistent with \nCongress\u2019s objective to foreclose stacking in pending \ncases while preserving the finality of past cases. \nThe opposite is true of the decision below. It draws an \narbitrary line between plenary sentencings and plenary \nresentencings, without any account for why Congress \nwould have intended such an irrational distinction. And \nin doing so, it ensures that prosecutors still may seek, and \n\n15 \n \ncourts still will be required to impose, stacked sentences \nin plenary sentencing proceedings into the future. That \ncannot be what Congress intended. \nB. The rule of lenity arises only if the Court concludes \nthat the statutory text is ambiguous, which the provision \nhere is not. But if the Court disagrees, it must resolve the \nambiguity in favor of Hewitt and the lesser sentence \nrequired under section 403(a). \nThe Court has repeatedly confirmed that the rule of \nlenity applies not only to statutes that define criminal \nliability, but also those that set the penalties for \nviolations. Under our interpretation of section 403(a), \nHewitt would face a mandatory minimum of 25 years. \nUnder the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit\u2019s mistaken \nconstruction, he would face a mandatory minimum of \nlonger than one century at his resentencing on the section \n924(c) counts alone. If there is any reasonable doubt \nabout the construction of section 403(a), it must be \nresolved in his favor. \nARGUMENT \n\u201cThe controlling principle in this case is the basic and \nunexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the \nclear meaning of statutes as written.\u201d Star Athletica, LLC \nv. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.S. 405, 414 (2017) \n(quoting Estate of Coward v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 \nU.S. 469, 476 (1992)). When the statute\u2019s text is \u201cunam-\nbiguous,\u201d that \u201cfirst step of the interpretive inquiry\u201d is \nalso the \u201clast.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 13 (2019). \nTo interpret Congress\u2019s words, the Court must focus \non \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u201d use of the \nEnglish language. Star Athletica, 580 U.S. at 414. That \nmeans among other things the Court must give the text a \nreading that is consistent with and incorporates settled \nbackground legal principles, with which the public would \nexpect any words to comport. E.g., Cannon v. University \n\n16 \n \nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-697 (1979) (explaining \nthat \u201c[i]t is always appropriate to assume that our elected \nrepresentatives, like other citizens, know the law\u201d). \nAnd while background principles, rules of grammar, \nand dictionary definitions are centrally important to the \ntask of statutory interpretation, the Court must \u201c\u2018con-\nsider not only the bare meaning\u2019 of the critical word or \nphrase \u2018but also its placement and purpose in the statu-\ntory scheme.\u2019\u201d Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6 \n(1999) (quoting Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145 \n(1995)). The only permissible meaning of a word or \nphrase is the one that fits with the statutory context and \npurpose, rather than conflicts with them. See, e.g., Dubin \nv. United States, 599 U.S. 110, 118-120 (2023). \nFirst, Congress did not intend the phrase \u201ca sentence \nfor the offense\u201d to include a vacated sentence. According \nto settled background principles, the law treats a vacated \nsentence as never having been pronounced. For a statute \nto override that principle requires a clear statement. \nThere is no such statement here.  \nSecond, the contrary rationales offered among the \nlower courts are unpersuasive. The rules of grammar, \nrelevant dictionary definitions, and statutory context all \nconfirm that Congress intended section 403(b) to \nauthorize section 403(a) relief in all pending cases, \nincluding cases that are pending de novo resentencing \nfollowing a vacatur. No other conclusion is consistent \nwith Congress\u2019s purpose or settled practice. And even if \nthere were doubt on that front (there should be none), it \nwould be resolved by the rule of lenity.  \nNo matter whether the Court finds the words clear or \nambiguous, a resentencing with the benefit of section \n403(a) is necessary. \n\n17 \n \nA. Section 403(a) applies to post-enactment \nde novo resentencings \nAll relevant considerations\u2014the text, context, and \npurpose of the FSA, the statute\u2019s design, and the back-\nground principles against which it was enacted\u2014confirm \nthat section 403(a) applies to plenary resentencings that \ntake place after the Act\u2019s enactment. \n1. A sentence that has been vacated is not \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d \nThe central issue is whether Congress meant \u201ca \nsentence for the offense\u201d imposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, \n2018, to include a sentence that was pronounced before \nthat date but later vacated. It did not. \na. One rule for reading \u201cstatutory text is recognizing \nthat Congress legislates against the backdrop of certain \nunexpressed presumptions.\u201d Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857 (2014). Among those presumptions is that \n\u201cCongress is aware of existing law\u201d and, absent express \nindication otherwise, intends for the statutes it enacts to \ncomport with settled background legal principles and \nprecedents. See, e.g., Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU \nOptronics Corp., 571 U.S. 161, 169 (2014); accord \nCannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697. \nPut another way, the background principles against \nwhich Congress acts operate as default rules to which it \npresumptively intends for its enactments to conform. \nBecause the accepted legal backdrop will generally accord \nwith \u201cwidely held intuitions about how statutes ordin-\narily operate,\u201d a presumption that Congress means to \nincorporate background legal principles \u201cwill generally \ncoincide with legislative and public expectations.\u201d \nLandgraf v. USI Film Productions, 511 U.S. 244, 272 \n(1994). Cf. US Airways, Inc. v. McCutchen, 569 U.S. 88, \n102 (2013) (in a case concerning ERISA plan documents, \nrelying on the \u201cdefault rules [that] govern in the absence \n\n18 \n \nof a clear expression of [a] contrary intent\u201d); Staub v. \nProctor Hospital, 562 U.S. 411, 418 (2011) (in a federal \ntort case, observing that the Court must \u201cconsult general \nprinciples of law\u201d that \u201cform the background against \nwhich federal tort laws are enacted\u201d). \nb. Here, the settled legal background against which \nsection 403(b) was adopted demonstrates beyond debate \nthat Congress did not mean for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a \nvacated sentence. Absent contrary intent, a vacated order \nis and always has been treated as though it was never \nentered in the first place\u2014it is a nullity, as though it never \nexisted. See United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382, 392 \n(3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring) (historical prin-\nciples \u201creveal that vacatur makes a sentence void from \nthe start\u201d). Nothing in section 403(b)\u2019s text overrides \nthat default understanding. \nTake first historical sources. At common law before \nthe Founding, vacatur on appeal made it \u201cas if no \n[judgment] had been\u201d entered, meaning in effect that \nthere was no \u201crecord of it.\u201d Ognell\u2019s Case (1592) 78 Eng. \nRep. 526, 526; 34 Cro. Eliz. 270, 271 (Q.B.); accord Eyre \nv. Woodfine (1592) 78 Eng. Rep. 533, 533; 34 Cro. Eliz. \n278, 278-279 (Q.B.). Countless other historical sources \nconfirm that when an order is vacated, it is \u201cin all respects \nas though the [order] had never been made.\u201d Norman v. \nNorman, 207 P. 970, 972 (Okla. 1922). Since time out of \nmind, courts have understood that vacatur \u201cputs the \nparties in the state, in which they were, immediately \nbefore the judgment was rendered,\u201d fully restoring the \nstatus quo ante. Lockwood v. Jones, 7 Conn. 431, 436 \n(1829). This Court summarized this principle more than \n150 years ago: \u201cvacating the former judgment * * * \nrender[s] it null and void, and the parties are left in the \nsame situation as if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 \n(1869).  \n\n19 \n \nA vacated order is not merely \u201csuspended\u201d on a \nforward-looking basis, while \u201cretain[ing] its vitality\u201d \nretrospectively. Stewart v. Oneal, 237 F. 897, 906 (6th \nCir. 1916). Rather, \u201cwhere an irregular order has been \nvacated it is held to be the same as though it never existed, \nand for that reason\u201d courts may not afford any \u201cprotec-\ntion to the acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth v. Western Union Telephone Co., 6 N.Y.S. \n735, 747 (Gen. Term 1889) (emphasis added). When \norders are vacated, it is \u201cas though they had never been \nmade or had\u201d in the first place. United States v. Mayse, 5 \nF.2d 885, 886 (9th Cir. 1925).2 \nThis ancient principle has been carried forward to \nmodern times without meaningful alteration. Like their \nforebears, cases since the midcentury onward confirm \nthat after a conviction is vacated, the defendant \u201cstand[s] \n \n2  Other historical examples expressing this principle are too many to \nlist. For a limited sample, see Williams v. Floyd, 27 N.C. 649, 656 \n(1845) (a void or \u201cstricken\u201d order is \u201cthe same as if the [order] had \nnever been made\u201d); Lawson v. Bissell, 7 Ohio St. 129, 132 (1857) \n(when a verdict and judgment are \u201cvacated\u201d it is \u201cas if there had been \nno trial\u201d); In re Lacey, 14 F. Cas. 906, 908 (C.C.D. Conn. 1874) \n(vacating an order allows the parties to act \u201cin the same way and \nmanner, and to the like effect\u201d as they could have had the order \n\u201cnever been made\u201d); Strickland v. Flagstaff Silver Mining Co., 1 Utah \n199, 204 (1875) (for purposes of post-judgment motions, a judgment \nthat is vacated \u201cwas as though it had never existed\u201d); Aultman v. \nSeiberling, 31 Ohio St. 201, 204 (1877) (when a decision is vacated, \nthe law and the facts are treated \u201cthe same as if no decision had been \nmade\u201d); Bondholders & Purchasers of the Iron Railroad v. Toledo, 62 \nF. 166, 168 (7th Cir. 1894) (after a court order vacating and annulling \na decree disallowing a claim, the claim was \u201cre-established in all \nrespects as fully as if [the vacated decree] had never been made\u201d); \nGreen v. McCarter, 42 S.E. 157, 158 (S.C. 1902) (when a judge \n\u201crevoke[s] his * * * order, the case [stands] just as if no order had been \nmade\u201d); In re Rochester Sanitarium & Baths Co., 222 F. 22, 26 (2d \nCir. 1915) (recognizing \u201c[t]he general rule\u201d that when a court vacates \nan order, \u201cit is the same as if such order had never existed\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nin the position of any man who was accused of a crime but \nhas not yet shown to have committed it.\u201d Fiswick v. \nUnited States, 329 U.S. 211, 223 (1946). \u201cThe general \nrule,\u201d according to these cases, \u201cis that when an order or \njudgment is vacated the previously existing status is \nrestored and the situation is the same as though the order \nor judgment had never been made.\u201d Wrang v. Spencer, \n235 A.2d 861, 863 (Conn. App. Ct. 1967). Nearly \nverbatim restatements of this universal principle appear \nin Mitchell v. Joseph, 117 F.2d 253, 255 (7th Cir. 1941); \nMiller v. Schlereth, 36 N.W.2d 497, 506 (Neb. 1949); \nTims v. Holland Furnace Co., 90 N.E.2d 376, 380 (Ohio \n1950); and Buchanan v. Cabiness, 245 S.W.2d 868, 873 \n(Mo. 1951) (en banc). \nThe notion that a vacated order is treated as though it \nhad never been entered in the first place reflects the same \nprinciple behind the Court\u2019s own Munsingwear doctrine: \nAn order vacating a judgment \u201celiminates [the] judg-\nment\u201d so that \u201cnone is prejudiced\u201d by it, \u201cclear[ing] the \npath for future relitigation of the issues between the \nparties.\u201d United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 40 \n(1950). \u201cThe point of vacatur is to prevent\u201d its object \n\u201cfrom spawning any legal consequences, so that no party \nis harmed by\u201d it. Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 \n(2011) (citing Munsingwear). \nAnd the law not only treats the vacated judgment as \na nullity in its own right, but also regards the proceedings \nproducing it effectively as never having happened. Thus, \nfor example, the vacatur of a criminal judgment of convic-\ntion on appeal effectively erases from history the fact of \nthe jury\u2019s empanelment in the original trial, and thus in \nmost circumstances \u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a \nnew trial.\u201d Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 12 (1978) \n(quoting Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 560 \n(1950)). That rule \u201crests ultimately upon the premise that \nthe original conviction has, at the defendant\u2019s behest, \n\n21 \n \nbeen wholly nullified and the slate wiped clean.\u201d North \nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721 (1969) (citing \nUnited States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662 (1896)). \nThe same rationale applies with respect to senten-\ncing. As the Court made clear in Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476 (2011), when a court of appeals \u201cset[s] \naside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and remand[s] for a \nde novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from the original \nsentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffectively wip[ing] \nthe slate clean.\u201d Id. at 507. Rulings made at the original \nsentencing therefore have no continuing vitality under \nthe law-of-the-case doctrine. Ibid. \nc. The legal backdrop against which Congress en-\nacted the FSA is thus clear: When a criminal sentence is \nvacated, the status quo ante is restored as if the sentence \nhad never been pronounced. A sentence that has been \nvacated is a nullity; it is nothing; it never existed. See \nFiswick, 329 U.S. at 223.  \nThat resolves this case. Congress specified that \nsection 403(a)\u2019s sentencing reform shall apply \u201cif a \nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. FSA \u00a7 403(b) (emphasis added). \nBecause a sentence that has been vacated is treated by \noperation of law as though it never was imposed\u2014so that \nit \u201cspawn[s no] legal consequences\u201d and \u201cno party is \nharmed by\u201d it (Camreta, 563 U.S. at 713 (quoting \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41))\u2014Congress could not \nhave intended for \u201ca sentence\u201d to include a vacated \nsentence. As a matter of law, an offender whose sentence \nhas been vacated is one for whom \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed\u201d ever, including as of \nDecember 21, 2018.  \n\n22 \n \n2. Contrary opinions among the lower courts \nare not persuasive \na. In holding otherwise, the Fifth Circuit focused on \nthe indefinite article, \u201ca\u201d appearing before the word \n\u201csentence.\u201d See Pet. App. 8a-9a. The same argument was \nspelled out by then-Judge Barrett in her dissent in United \nStates v. Uriarte, 975 F.3d 596 (7th Cir. 2020) (en banc): \n\u201c[T]he indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is broad enough,\u201d she argued, \n\u201cto refer to any sentence that has been imposed for the \noffense, even one that was subsequently vacated.\u201d Id. at \n608. In her and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, a pre-enactment \nsentence, even if later vacated, remains \u201ca sentence\u201d \nimposed \u201cas of\u201d December 21, 2018. Ibid.; Pet. App. 8a-\n9a; see also United States v. Hernandez, 107 F.4th 965, \n969 (11th Cir. 2024). \nRespectfully, that position disregards the nature of a \nvacatur and the default rule that it establishes. When \nCongress says \u201ca sentence\u201d without more, it cannot mean \na sentence that is treated by operation of law as never \nhaving been imposed. Otherwise, what would it mean for \nsomething to be treated as never having been imposed? \nThat conclusion does not add words to the statute, as \nthe Fifth Circuit implied. In the lower court\u2019s view, \u201c[i]f \nCongress meant for the First Step Act\u2019s retroactivity bar \nto apply only to valid sentences, it could easily have said \nso\u201d by specifying \u201ca valid sentence.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. But \nthat misses the point, which is that an adjective like \n\u201cvalid\u201d would have been redundant given the background \nlegal principles against which Congress adopted the FSA. \nAgain, Congress is presumed to be aware of and \nincorporate those principles in the statues it enacts. And \nhere, the long-settled rule is that when an unlawful \u201corder \nhas been vacated it is held to be the same as though it \nnever existed\u201d and the law will \u201cafford no protection to \n\n23 \n \nthe acts which may have been performed under it.\u201d \nFarnsworth, 6 N.Y.S. at 747.  \nAccordingly, it is the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, not \npetitioner\u2019s, that would add words to the statute. To read \n\u201ca sentence\u201d as including a vacated sentence would be to \nread the statute as saying \u201can initial sentence\u201d or \u201can \noriginal sentence.\u201d Use of such adjectives would have \nreadily displaced the default rule that a vacated sentence \nis treated as a matter of law as never having existed. But \nCongress did not use those modifiers, and thus the \nassumption \u201cthat our elected representatives, like other \ncitizens, know the law\u201d when they draft and enact \nstatutes (Cannon, 441 U.S. at 696-697) carries the day \nfor Hewitt. \nb. Some lower courts have instead simply denied the \npremise of the argument, asserting that an order fully \nvacating a sentence \u201cdoes not require the district court to \nproceed as if the initial sentencing never happened.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 9a (quoting Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting)). For support, they have pointed to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3742(g)(1), which specifies that \u201ca district court \nimposing a sentence on remand\u201d following a vacatur on \nappeal \u201cmust apply the Sentencing Guidelines \u2018that were \nin effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defen-\ndant prior to the appeal.\u2019\u201d Uriarte, 975 F.3d at 608 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (quoting section 3742(g)(1)). \nThat, we are told, is evidence that the effects of a vacated \nsentence are not wholly eliminated, and a court need not \n\u201cproceed as if the earlier sentencing never happened.\u201d \nUnited States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790, 792 (6th Cir. \n2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in the denial of rehear-\ning en banc). \nThat misunderstands what section 3742(g)(1) does. \nAs a starting point, the very relevance of the provision is \ndoubtful. It provides only that when a court of appeals \nremands a case for resentencing (plenary or otherwise), \n\n24 \n \nthe district court must utilize the sentencing guidelines \n\u201cthat were in effect on the date of the previous sen-\ntencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1). That shows only that \nCongress did not want changes to the guidelines to apply \nretroactively at resentencing. The statute\u2019s reference to \nthe state of the law on \u201cthe date of\u201d a prior proceeding \ndoes not suggest in any way that a vacated sentence itself \ncontinues to have legal force or effect.  \nMoreover, to the extent section 3742(g) has any rele-\nvance, it is only to confirm that Congress knows how to \nuse express language to override the default rule when it \nwishes to. Our point is not that a vacated sentence can \nnever have ongoing consequences\u2014it is only that, given \nthat Congress is assumed to understand that a vacated \nsentence is treated as if it were never entered, Congress \nwould have to use express language to accomplish that \nobjective. That is at most what section 3742(g) confirms: \nWhen Congress wants a vacated sentence to continue to \nhave some effect, it says so using a clear statement. Such \nlanguage is missing from section 403(b). \n3. Section 403(b) refers to the ongoing enforce-\nment of a sentence, not the fact of a past pro-\nnouncement \na. Other lower court opinions have rejected the rele-\nvance of vacatur by characterizing the imposition of a \nsentence as a historical fact that, if it occurred, cannot be \nerased from the documented past by a later vacatur of the \nsentence. According to this rationale, when Congress said \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018 (FSA \u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif \na sentence was not pronounced before\u201d that date.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit took this view in Hernandez. \nThere, it reasoned that section 403(b) \u201cis best read to \nrefer to a completed act\u201d because it conjugates the verb \n\n25 \n \n\u201cimposed,\u201d which \u201crefers to the historical fact of pro-\nnouncement\u201d taking place at \u201ca specific point in time.\u201d \nHernandez, 107 F.4th at 969-970; accord Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. Viewing the imposition of a sentence this way renders \neffect of vacatur irrelevant, according to these sources, \nbecause \u201cvacatur does not erase * * * from history\u201d the \nrecorded fact that a sentence was pronounced on a date \npreceding enactment. United States v. Jackson, 995 F.3d \n522, 525 (6th Cir. 2021). \nb. The problem with that approach is two-fold.  \nFirst, that is indeed precisely what an order of vacatur \ndoes\u2014by operation of law, it erases from history both the \nvacated order or judgment and the proceeding that \nproduced it. Thus, when a verdict and judgment are \n\u201cvacate[d],\u201d it is \u201cas if no trial had ever taken place in the \ncause.\u201d Ayres, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) at 610; accord Lawson, \n7 Ohio St. at 132 (following a vacatur, the case must \nproceed \u201cas if there had been no trial\u201d).  \nAgain, that is the premise underlying the rule that \n\u201cthere is no double jeopardy upon a new trial\u201d following \na vacatur on appeal of the final judgment. Burks, 437 U.S. \nat 12. \u201cThere are few if any rules of criminal procedure \nclearer than the rule that \u2018jeopardy attaches when the jury \nis empaneled and sworn.\u2019\u201d Martinez v. Illinois, 572 U.S. \n833, 839 (2014) (quoting Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 \n(1978)). But when a conviction is later vacated, the law \ntreats the jury\u2019s empanelment at the first trial effectively \nas if it had never happened. Burks, 437 U.S. at 12.  \nApplied here, that means that no legal disability may \nfollow from Hewitt\u2019s sentence ever having existed, \nincluding any disability following from the historical fact \nof the pronouncement having taken place. \nSecond, the historical-fact approach to section 403(b) \nis inconsistent with the verb tense and preposition that \nCongress used there. If Congress had meant the applic-\n\n26 \n \nability of section 403(a) to turn on whether a district \njudge had pronounced a sentence on a date preceding \nDecember 21, 2018, as a simple matter of historical fact, \nit would not have used the present-perfect tense or the \npreposition \u201cas of.\u201d Instead, it would have used the \nsimple past tense, together with a preposition such as \nbefore or prior to\u2014it would have said section 403(a) shall \napply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the \noffense was imposed before such date of enactment.\u201d That \nword choice would have been consistent with the House \nLegislative Drafting Manual, which directs drafters of \nlegislation to use the past tense to refer to \u201cfacts that \nmust precede\u201d the statute\u2019s \u201coperation.\u201d House Legisla-\ntive Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104-1, \n\u00a7 351(f)(2), at 60 (1995). \nBut that is not the formulation that Congress chose. \nInstead, it used the present-perfect tense, together with \nthe preposition \u201cas of.\u201d Each alone\u2014and undeniably both \ntogether\u2014connote an ongoing condition rather than the \noccurrence of a singular past event.  \nThe relevant grammar rules make this clear. The \npresent-perfect tense uses the words \u201chas been\u201d (or in \nthis case \u201chas not been\u201d). Whereas the past tense \u201cis a \nsimple tense, just past,\u201d the present perfect \u201cis a com-\npound tense combining past and present.\u201d Rodney Hud-\ndleston & Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar \nof the English Language 142 (2002) (hereinafter \nCambridge Grammar). That is to say, the present perfect \n\u201cinvolves reference to both past and present time\u201d and \n\u201cis concerned with a time-span beginning in the past and \nextending up to now.\u201d Id. at 143 (emphasis added). Thus, \nin contrast with the past tense, which focuses on a \nsingular past occurrence, \u201cthe primary focus\u201d of the \npresent-perfect \u201cis on the present.\u201d Ibid. It accordingly \n\u201cis not used in contexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of \n[the time span] is explicitly or implicitly excluded,\u201d such \n\n27 \n \nas when one is speaking about a discrete past event that \nhas concluded. Ibid. \nThat alone forecloses Hernandez\u2019s past-historical-\nfact rationale. If one says that a sentence \u201chas been im-\nposed as of\u201d some past date, it indicates that the sentence \nwas in effect on that date and is still being enforced today, \n\u201cextending up to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. It \nindicates, in other words, that the sentence remains final \nand in force at the time of speaking, and that it has not \nbeen vacated by a court. 3 \nThat conclusion follows not only from the use of the \npresent-perfect tense, but also from the preposition \u201cas \nof,\u201d which indicates a time or date \u201cfrom\u201d which some-\nthing begins or continues. See Collins English Dictionary \n113 (14th ed. 2023) (hereinafter Collins). One would say, \nfor example, that a contract is effective \u201cas of\u201d the date it \ncomes into force. In doing so, one would indicate the \ncommencement of a continuous period of enforcement\u2014\nthe effective date and onward. And if one were to combine \n\u201cas of\u201d with the present-perfect tense (stating that a \ncontract \u201chas been effective as of December 21, 2018\u201d), \nthe plain meaning would be that the contract was en-\nforceable on that date and remains so now. In contrast, it \nwould be incoherent to say that a contract \u201chas been \neffective as of December 21, 2018,\u201d if, at the time of \nspeaking, the contract was terminated by the parties or \nvoided by a court.3 \n \n3  It bears noting \u201cthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting \nconvention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of \nenactment,\u201d but \u201c\u2018as of any date on which it is read.\u2019\u201d Carr v. United \nStates, 560 U.S. 438, 463 (2010) (Alito, J., dissenting) (quoting \nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting \nManual \u00a7 103(a), at 4 (1997)). This convention recognizes that most \nlaws \u201chave a continuing effect in that they apply over time,\u201d and they \nthus \u201cspeak at the time of reading, not merely at the time of their \nadoption.\u201d Id. at 464.  \n\n28 \n \nThe same goes for section 403(b). Congress specified \nthat section 403(a) shall apply to a pre-enactment offense \n\u201cif a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of\u201d \nDecember 21, 2018. The inverse is that section 403(a) \nshall not apply to a pre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence \nfor the offense has been imposed as of\u201d that date. But it \nwould be ungrammatical to say that Hewitt is a defendant \non whom \u201ca sentence has been imposed as of\u201d December \n21, 2018, because that formulation mistakenly implies \nthat at the time of speaking, there is a present, ongoing \nenforcement of his sentence. \nOne might say that Hewitt\u2019s initial sentence was \nimposed before that date. But, again, those are not the \nwords Congress used. And \u201ccourts must presume that a \nlegislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \nstatute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut National Bank v. \nGermain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-254 (1992). \nc. Use of the word \u201cimposed\u201d does not change mat-\nters. To be sure, \u201cimposed,\u201d viewed in isolation, can be \ntaken to mean \u201cto establish as something to be obeyed or \ncomplied with.\u201d Collins 984; see also Webster\u2019s Third \nNew International Dictionary 1136 (2002) (hereinafter \nWebster\u2019s) (defining impose as, among other things, \n\u201cbestow\u201d). On that meaning, a judge who imposes a \nsentence establishes it or bestows it on the defendant as a \nmatter of fact at a singular point in time.  \nBut the word can also mean to \u201cenforce\u201d (Collins \n984) or to \u201capply,\u201d as in a \u201cpenalty\u201d (Webster\u2019s 1136). \nUnderstood in that way, the word means an ongoing \ncondition of enforcement: A sentence is imposed on (it is \napplied to or enforced against) an offender during the \nentire duration of his or her incarceration. This meaning \nsuggests not a singular past occurrence that took place at \na particular point in time, but rather an ongoing condition: \nA \u201csentence remains \u2018imposed\u2019\u201d until it is \u201cvacate[d].\u201d \n\n29 \n \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 223 (6th Cir. \n2020). \nThe academic possibility of these two meanings does \nnot render section 403(b) ambiguous. The proper interp-\nretation of \u201cwords that can have more than one meaning\u201d \nare generally resolved \u201cby their surroundings.\u201d Arizona \nv. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 10 (2013) \n(quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, \n531 U.S. 457, 466 (2001)). That is, the \u201csusceptibility\u201d \nof a singular word to multiple meanings does not neces-\nsarily render the word ambiguous, because \u201call but one of \nthe meanings is ordinarily eliminated by context.\u201d Deal v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-132 (1993). \nJust so here. By using the present-perfect tense \n(rather than the past tense) and the preposition \u201cas of\u201d \n(rather than \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to\u201d) Congress signaled its \nfocus on a \u201ctime-span beginning in the past and extending \nup to now.\u201d Cambridge Grammar 143. Any contention \nthat the word \u201cimposed\u201d in section 403(b) \u201crefers to the \nhistorical fact of pronouncement\u201d at \u201ca specific point in \ntime\u201d (Hernandez, 107 F.4th at 970) rather than a \ncondition of ongoing enforcement would require reform-\ning the tense and replacing the preposition that Congress \nused. The law permits no such revisions. \nd. Moreover, section 404 of the FSA demonstrates \nthat Congress was aware of and intended the difference. \nThere, Congress provided for motions to reduce valid, \nfinal sentences in limited circumstances. See generally \nConcepcion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481 (2022). In \ndoing so, Congress limited relief in two notable ways. \nFirst, it specified in section 404(c) that \u201c[n]o court shall \nentertain a motion made under this section to reduce a \nsentence if the sentence was previously imposed or \npreviously reduced\u201d under certain circumstances. FSA \n\u00a7 404(c), Pet. App. 21a. If the lower court were correct \nthat Congress intended in section 403(b) to refer to a \n\n30 \n \nsingular past event (the pronouncement of a sentence \nbefore enactment), it presumably would have used the \nsame formulation\u2014section 403(a) shall apply to pre-\nenactment offenses \u201cif no sentence for the offense was \npreviously imposed.\u201d It did not do so. \n Second, also in section 404(c), Congress foreclosed \nrelief if a motion \u201cto reduce the sentence was, after the \ndate of enactment of this Act, denied after a complete \nreview of the motion on the merits.\u201d Again, if the lower \ncourt\u2019s reading were correct, Congress could have used \nthat alternative formulation in section 403(b)\u2014section \n403(a) shall apply to pre-enactment offenses \u201cif no \nsentence for the offense was imposed before said date of \nenactment.\u201d Again, it did not do so. \nBoth examples demonstrate that Congress knows \nhow to use the simple past tense to denote discrete events \ntaking place at fixed times in the past when it wishes to. \nIt did so in section 404(c), but it did not do so in section \n403(b). And the Court \u201cgenerally presum[es] that Con-\ngress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another.\u201d Intel Corp. Investment Policy Committee v. \nSulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 186 (2020) (quoting BFP v. Res-\nolution Trust Corporation, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994)).  \nAll of this leads to a straightforward conclusion: \nWhen Congress said that section 403(a) shall apply to a \npre-enactment offense \u201cif a sentence for the offense has \nnot been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b), Pet. App. 20a), it meant a sentence that was \nbeing enforced \u201cas of\u201d that date and is still being enforced \nat the relevant time of reading. And needless to say, that \ndoes not describe a sentence vacated before the reading.  \n\n31 \n \n4. Purpose and practice confirm that section \n403(a) applies to plenary resentencings \na. Purpose and practice confirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nerror in this case. Statutory interpretation turns on the \nway that ordinary English speakers use language. The \nCourt thus has a long history of reading statutory words \nand phrases \u201cnot in a vacuum, but with reference to the \nstatutory context, \u2018structure, history, and purpose,\u2019\u201d \n\u201cnot to mention common sense.\u201d Abramski v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 169, 179 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. \nSpears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)). While rules of grammar, \ndictionary definitions, and background legal principles \nare of course matters of central importance, the Court \n\u201cmust not be guided by a single sentence or member of a \nsentence\u201d studied in the academic abstract; it must \ninstead \u201clook to the provisions of the whole law, and to \nits object and policy.\u201d Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 43 \n(1986) (quoting Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 477 \nU.S. 207, 221 (1986)).  \nAlthough broader in total effect, the FSA\u2019s \u201cmost \nimportant reforms\u201d were the \u201cchanges to mandatory \nminimums\u201d at issue here. 164 Cong. Rec. S7748 (daily \ned. Dec. 18, 2018) (statement of Sen. Klobuchar). Moved \nby heartless examples of excessive imprisonment, Con-\ngress set out to \u201celiminate[] the so-called stacking pro-\nvision in the U.S. Code\u201d and to \u201censure that sentencing \nenhancements for repeat offenses apply only to true \nrepeat offenders.\u201d Id. at S7774 (statement of Sen. \nCardin); accord 164 Cong. Rec. H10362 (daily ed. Dec. \n20, 2018) (statement of Rep. Nadler). Courts on both \nsides of the issue have thus concluded that the FSA\u2019s \npurpose \u201cis obvious: to reduce the harsh length of sen-\ntences for * * * certain firearms offenses.\u201d Mitchell, 38 \nF.4th at 387. It was, in other words, \u201cto ensure that the \nlengthy mandatory-minimum sentences for stacked \n\n32 \n \n\u00a7 924(c) convictions ended, whether at initial senten-\ncings or resentencings.\u201d Henry, 983 F.3d at 224.  \nTo that end, Congress made section 403(a) applicable \nnot only to post-enactment crimes, but also pre-enact-\nment ones. In doing so, it had two options: First, it could \nmake section 403(a) retroactively applicable to all \ndefendants serving stacked sentences, including those \nsubject to valid final judgments. Second, it could make \nsection 403(a) retroactively applicable to crimes com-\nmitted pre-enactment, but only in pending, non-final \ncases.  \nThe choice required a balance of competing values of \nthe highest order. On the one hand, Congress was deeply \nconcerned that defendants were serving unduly harsh and \noverlong sentences. Few government interventions have \nthe same impact and gravity as deprivation of liberty by \nimprisonment. On the other hand, there is a \u201cstrong \ninterest in preserving the finality of judgments.\u201d Harris \nv. Rivera, 454 U.S. 339, 348 n.21 (1981) (quoting Hen-\nderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 n.13 (1977)). \nLegislators understand that \u201c[f]inality is essential to both \nthe retributive and the deterrent functions of criminal \nlaw.\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 555 (1998). \nAnd finality serves the public\u2019s interest in efficient \njudicial administration, increases confidence in the \njustice system, and fosters the public interest in repose. \nEvidently with these latter principles in mind, Con-\ngress selected the second option: It made section 403(a) \nrelief available to defendants whose criminal conduct \npredated enactment of the statute, but whose cases were \n\u201cpending\u201d (that is, those whose sentence \u201chas not been \n\n33 \n \nimposed as of\u201d the FSA\u2019s enactment). See FSA \u00a7 403(b) \n(titled \u201cApplicability to Pending Cases\u201d).4 \nIn taking this approach, \u201cCongress stanched, to the \ndegree that it could,\u201d the problem of sentence stacking, \nbut \u201cwithout overturning valid and settled sentences.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 601. \u201cIn choosing not to write \n\u00a7 403(b) to allow reductions to valid sentences that al-\nready had been imposed, Congress expressed a policy \npreference in favor of settled expectations and ease of \nadministration.\u201d Id. at 605; see also United States v. \nMerrell, 37 F.4th 571, 576 (9th Cir. 2022) (\u201c[W]e find it \nclear that \u00a7 403(b) was intended to ensure that the \nadoption of the First Step Act by itself would not affect \nany sentence previously imposed.\u201d); Henry, 983 F.3d at \n225 (\u201cCongress chose not to disrupt the finality of past \nsentences \n* * * \nfor \ndefendants \nserving \nstacked \nsentences.\u201d).  \nWhat is more, Congress \u201cnaturally wanted to reach \nall cases where there was not already a sentence in place.\u201d \nUriarte, 975 F.3d at 605. It intended to give defendants \nthe benefit of section 403(a) at all future plenary \nsentencing proceedings, without disturbing the sentences \nvalidly imposed in past proceedings. \nb. Applying section 403(a) to defendants like Hewitt \nis consistent with Congress\u2019s policy choice. The lower \ncourt\u2019s contrary decision is not. \nOnce a court vacates a criminal sentence and orders a \nde novo resentencing, there can no longer be any interest \n \n4  \u201cThis Court has long considered that the title of a statute and the \nheading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt \nabout the meaning of\u201d a statutory provision. Dubin, 599 U.S. at 120-\n121 (cleaned up). A section title cannot \u201coverride\u201d the words that \nfollow, but Congress\u2019s words \u201cmust be construed in light of the terms \nsurrounding them, and the title Congress chose is among those \nterms.\u201d Id. at 121 (cleaned up).  \n\n34 \n \nin finality. See Pepper, 562 U.S. at 507. Because the \ndistrict court must resentence the defendant \u201cas if no \ninitial sentencing ever occurred\u201d (United States v. Burke, \n863 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir. 2017)), finality is already \nout the window by the time the district court undertakes \na de novo resentencing following a vacatur. The initial \nsentence is gone, and a brand new sentence must be deter-\nmined and pronounced. \nPractice bears this out. A plenary resentencing is a de \nnovo proceeding, and the district court must exercise its \ndiscretion anew in setting an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A]t \nany subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set \naside,\u201d the court must determine a sentence \u201cbased on \nappropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a),\u201d without regard for prior rulings from the \ninitial sentencing. Pepper, 562 U.S. at 490. Among other \nthings, the probation officer must prepare a new \npresentence report (see Pet. App. 3a-4a; Dkt. 785, at 15), \nthe parties must submit new objections and responses \n(Dkts. 694, 699), and the court must hold a new hearing \nand consider and resolve the disagreements. See Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 484.  \nThere is no conceivable reason that Congress would \nhave wanted district courts to continue imposing \u201cirra-\ntional, inhumane, and absurd\u201d sentences pursuant to a \n\u201ccruel and unjust\u201d sentencing rule (Hungerford, 465 \nF.3d at 1118 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)) that it had just \nrepealed retroactively for all pending cases. On the \ncontrary, lawmakers \u201cwanted the unfair practice\u201d of \nstacking \u201cstopped upon enactment\u201d (Uriarte, 975 F.3d at \n603) because they \u201crecognized that such lengthy sen-\ntences * * * were draconian and sought to end the \npractice\u201d (Henry, 983 F.3d at 225).  \nNo court and no party in any case presenting this \nissue has identified any reason why Congress would have \nintended for courts to continue to impose since-repu-\n\n35 \n \ndiated stacking rules in plenary resentencings. Simply \nput, there is none. Given \u201cthat Congress had determined \nthat the earlier sentencing structure resulted in sentences \nthat were too long and unfair,\u201d its goal was to \u201censur[e] \nthat those sentences would not be imposed on defendants \nyet to be sentenced,\u201d for whatever reason. Uriarte, 975 \nF.3d at 603. The Court is not required to turn a blind eye \nto that purpose, adopting an interpretation that does \nviolence to it rather than respecting it. \nB. Any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of \napplying section 403(a) to Hewitt \nIf, after all, there were any doubt about section \n403(b)\u2019s proper interpretation, the rule of lenity would \nrequire the Court to resolve it in Hewitt\u2019s favor. A penal \nstatute cannot be construed to impose a 105-year \nmandatory minimum sentence when another plausible \nreading would produce a 25-year mandatory minimum. \nNo matter the Court\u2019s view of the interpretations adopted \nby the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, Hewitt\u2019s inter-\npretation is at the very least a plausible one. The rule of \nlenity thus requires the Court to adopt it.  \n1. The rule of lenity is an interpretive canon \u201cnot \nmuch less old than [statutory] construction itself.\u201d \nUnited States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 \n(1820) (Marshall, C.J.). It demands that \u201cambiguity \nconcerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be \nresolved in favor of lenity.\u201d Skilling v. United States, 561 \nU.S. 358, 410 (2010) (quoting Cleveland v. United States, \n531 U.S. 12, 25 (2000)). It \u201capplies not only to \ninterpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal \nprohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.\u201d \nBifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980). \nSimply stated, \u201c[i]n the construction of a penal statute, it \nis well settled *\u202f*\u202f* that all reasonable doubts concerning \n\n36 \n \nits meaning ought to operate in favor of [the defendant].\u201d \nHarrison v. Vose, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 372, 378 (1850).  \nThe rule is grounded in the Constitution. It ensures \n\u201cthat the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, \nnot in the judicial department,\u201d for it is \u201cthe legislature, \nnot the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its \npunishment.\u201d Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95; see \nalso Wooden v. United States, 595 U.S. 360, 388-392 \n(2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing the due-\nprocess and separation-of-powers underpinnings).  \nThe rule of lenity applies when the ordinary tools of \nconstruction (\u201ctext, structure, and history\u201d) \u201cfail to \nestablish that\u201d the harsher reading is \u201cunambiguously \ncorrect.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 54 \n(1994). Lenity applies \u201cwhen, after consulting traditional \ncanons of statutory construction, [the Court is] left with \nan ambiguous statute.\u201d Shular v. United States, 589 U.S. \n154, 165 (2020) (quoting United States v. Shabani, 513 \nU.S. 10, 17 (1994)); see also Wooden, 595 U.S. at 392-\n393 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  \n2. As we demonstrated in the preceding parts of this \nbrief, section 403(b) states plainly that Hewitt\u2019s plenary \nresentencing shall be subject to section 403(a). That is \nthe only reading consistent with the background rules \nagainst which Congress enacted the FSA, as well as the \nrelevant rules of grammar, the definitions of the terms \nused, the structure and scheme of the statute, and \nCongress\u2019s manifest purpose. \nIf for any reason the Court concludes that the lower \ncourt\u2019s alternative interpretation is a possible one, the \nrule of lenity would dictate that the ambiguity be resolved \nin Hewitt\u2019s favor. Indeed, this is a textbook case for \napplication of lenity. Defendants like Hewitt who are \nresentenced will receive drastically lower sentences \nunder our interpretation than they would under the Fifth, \n\n37 \n \nSixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction. \u201c[L]enity \nmeans that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal \nstatute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an \nindividual when such an interpretation can be based on no \nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Bifulco, \n447 U.S. at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 \nU.S. 169, 178 (1958)). To adopt the Fifth, Sixth, and \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s reading would mean making just such \na guess.  \nIf, after applying all the textual rules of construction, \nthe Court sees no one clear answer, then lenity requires \nreversal. Granderson proves the point. There, as here, the \nCourt addressed a question of statutory interpretation \nconcerning sentencing. 511 U.S. at 41. The practical \ndifference between the principal options was a mandatory \n20-month sentence (if the government was correct) or a \nmandatory two-month sentence (if the defendant was \ncorrect). Id. at 41-42. After evaluating the \u201ctext, \nstructure, and history\u201d and finding no clear answer, the \nCourt \u201cappl[ied] the rule of lenity and resolve[d] the \nambiguity in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d Id. at 54.  \nThe same process is required here. There is no \nquestion that Hewitt must be resentenced. Under our \ninterpretation of section 403(a), he would face a \nmandatory minimum of 25 years. Under the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 construction, he would face a \nmandatory minimum of longer than 100 years at his \nresentencing. Were there any \u201creasonable doubt\u201d about \nthe construction of section 403(a), that doubt \u201cshould be \nresolved in favor of\u201d Hewitt. Wooden, 595 U.S. at 397 \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \n \n \n\n38 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand with instruc-\ntions to resentence Hewitt under section 403(a). \nRespectfully submitted. \nEugene R.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial state of knowledge was a blank slate regarding this case. I now understand the fundamental legal dispute in *Hewitt v. United States*. The core issue is one of statutory interpretation concerning Section 403 of the First Step Act of 2018. Specifically, the Supreme Court must decide whether this section, which eliminated the \"stacking\" of mandatory minimum sentences for certain firearm offenses (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)), applies to a defendant who is resentenced *after* the Act was passed, even though their original sentence was imposed *before* the Act's enactment.\n\nMy analysis has identified several key factors that will likely determine the outcome:\n1.  **Statutory Text:** The precise wording of Section 403 and its applicability clause will be paramount.\n2.  **Legal Precedent:** Existing case law on sentencing, resentencing, and statutory retroactivity will provide the framework for the Court's analysis.\n3.  **Lower Court Reasoning:** The rationale of the Fifth Circuit in affirming the original sentence will be a key point of contention.\n4.  **Executive Branch Position:** A highly significant signal has been identified: the U.S. government, which is the respondent in this case, has changed its position and now agrees with the petitioner that Section 403 should apply. This \"confession of error\" by the Solicitor General is a strong indicator that the government believes the lower court's decision is incorrect and substantially increases the likelihood that the petitioner will prevail.\n\nMy understanding has evolved from having no information to framing the central legal question and identifying the critical predictive variables. While I still lack the specific arguments from the legal briefs and the detailed reasoning of the lower court, I now have a clear roadmap for my analysis and have identified a major signal (the government's position change) that points toward a potential outcome.",

This action reinforces a sophisticated predictive strategy.\n\nJoint EIG (0.6): The action's value lies in its strategic correctness.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Hewitt v. United States* continues to be refined. I began with a general grasp of the legal question: whether Section 403 of the First Step Act applies to defendants resentenced after its enactment for crimes committed before. I had identified the statutory text, precedent, lower court reasoning, and the government's \"confession of error\" as the key predictive factors.\n\nThe petitioner's merits brief has now provided a detailed and specific roadmap of the primary legal arguments the Supreme Court will consider, moving my understanding from a high-level framework to a granular analysis of the legal doctrine.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Statutory Text Interpretation (Now Highly Specified):** My initial belief that the text would be paramount is confirmed and specified. The petitioner's core argument is that a vacated sentence is a legal nullity, treated as if it never existed (*void ab initio*). Therefore, when Hewitt appeared for resentencing after the First Step Act's passage, there was no legally effective sentence that \"has not been imposed as of such date of enactment\" under Section 403(b). The petitioner argues the use of the present-perfect tense (\"has been imposed\") combined with \"as of\" implies the sentence must have been imposed *and remain legally valid* on the date of enactment. Since Hewitt's sentence was later vacated, it fails this test.\n\n2.  **Legal Precedent & Principles (Now Concrete):** I can now anchor my analysis in specific legal principles cited by the petitioner:\n    *   **Effect of Vacatur:** The brief heavily relies on the long-standing principle that a vacated judgment is a \"nullity\" and has no ongoing legal effect (*Burks v. United States*, *Fiswick v. United States*). This principle is central to their textual argument.\n    *   **Nature of Resentencing:** A plenary or *de novo* resentencing is a new proceeding, not merely a continuation of the old one. The brief argues that in such a new proceeding, the court must apply the law as it currently exists, which includes the First Step Act's prohibition on stacking. This is supported by precedent like *Pepper v. United States*.\n    *   **Rule of Lenity:** As a fallback, the petitioner argues that if the statute is deemed ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires the Court to interpret it in the defendant's favor. The brief cites cases like *United States v. Granderson* and *Wooden v. United States* to support this canon of construction for criminal statutes.\n\n3.  **Congressional Purpose:** The petitioner's brief frames the issue around Congress's clear intent to eliminate the \"unjust and irrational\" practice of sentence stacking. They argue that forcing a court to reimpose a stacked sentence during a post-Act resentencing would directly contradict and defeat the \"principal aim of the law.\"\n\n4.  **Executive Branch Position (Contextualized):** The petitioner's strong textual and purposive arguments provide a clear rationale for the Solicitor General's \"confession of error.\" It is now highly probable that the government agrees with the petitioner's interpretation that a vacated sentence does not count as a sentence \"imposed\" for the purposes of Section 403(b). This alignment between the petitioner and the government on the core legal interpretation significantly increases the probability of a ruling in the petitioner's favor.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has evolved from identifying the battleground to understanding the specific weapons and tactics the petitioner will deploy. I now have a detailed theory of the case for the petitioner, grounded in specific textual analysis, legal doctrines like vacatur, and canons of interpretation like the rule of lenity. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioner has increased, as their arguments appear legally robust and are bolstered by the government's agreement. The next critical piece of information will be the arguments presented by the court-appointed amicus curiae, who will defend the Fifth Circuit's contrary position.",

The quality and nature of these arguments could either cement my belief in a reversal (if they are weak) or significantly reduce it (if they are strong and novel), leading to a massive potential update in my posterior. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is also substantial because this case, with the government's confession of error, serves as a crucial data point. Analyzing the amicus brief and the eventual outcome will help me calibrate my general model for how the Court weighs the Solicitor General's position against a robust, court-vetted counterargument, a recurring and important dynamic.",

L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin). Operating under rigid mandatory \n \n2 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *16 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n3 Congressional Rsrch.

As a \nresult, federal sentencing laws had \u201ccreated racially \ndiscriminatory outcomes and increased overcrowding \nand costs.\u201d4 \nBy enacting the First Step Act, \u201cCongress sought \nto recalibrate its approach.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, \nNo. 22-340, slip op. at 1, 601 U.S. ____ (2024) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). The law was a \u201chistoric\u201d \nexample of Congress \u201cputting [its] words into action\u201d \nafter \u201cyears talking about reducing crime, enacting \nfair sentencing laws, and restoring lives.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. H10,364 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018) (statement of \nRep. Sensenbrenner). The law\u2019s passage showcased \nbipartisan legislating \u201con a scale not often seen in \nWashington these days.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily \ned. Dec. 19, 2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nSenator Charles E. Grassley noted that Congress has \nrarely had legislation before it with \u201csuch diverse \ngroups of people and organizations that support the \nbill.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,778 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018). \nThe coalition behind the First Step Act ranged from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Association of Prosecuting \nAttorneys. 164 Cong. Rec. S7,839 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n2018) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Senator Patrick \nLeahy called the bill \u201cnot just bipartisan; it is nearly \nnonpartisan.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. S7,749 (daily ed. Dec. \n18, 2018). As President Trump said from the Oval \n \n4 President Donald J.

According to \nthe lead sponsors of the bill, without the sentencing \nreforms, \u201cmuch of the Act\u2019s support would have fallen \naway.\u201d Brief for United States Senators Richard J. \nDurbin et al. as Amici Curiae Supporting Defendant-\nAppellant 1\u20132, Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021) (No. 20-5904). Indeed, \u201c[t]he Act might not \nhave passed at all.\u201d Id. at 2. Today, the Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms promise \u201cmore individuals the \nchance \nto \navoid \none-size-fits-all \nmandatory \nminimums.\u201d Pulsifer, slip op. at 1 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting).

(citing First Step Act \u00a7 403(a)). \nRecidivism data confirm that the sentencing \nmodifications are working.

This Court and the courts of appeals have \nconfirmed that the Act\u2019s interpretation warrants \nattention. This very term in Pulsifer v. United States, \nthe Court stressed the First Step Act\u2019s importance, \ncalling it a \u201csignificant sentencing reform law.\u201d \nPulsifer, slip op. at 26. The Court also emphasized the \nneed to interpret the FSA\u2019s provisions consistently. \nId. (explaining that this Court granted certiorari to \nsettle a circuit split by determining when a defendant \nis eligible for the Act\u2019s safety-valve relief). The Sixth \nCircuit has recognized that the First Step Act \u201cis the \nproduct of a remarkable bipartisan effort to remedy \npast \noverzealous \nuse \nof \nmandatory-minimum \n \n7 U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., Federal Prisons: Bureau of \nPrisons Should Improve Efforts to Implement its Risk and Needs \nAssessment System 1 (Mar. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/YP8W-\n7J3M. \n8 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, First Step Act Annual Report 41 (Apr. \n2023), https://perma.cc/MV79-2R7S. \n9 New CCJ Analysis Estimates First Step Act Releases Have \nLower Recidivism Rates, Arrests, Council on Criminal Justice \n(Aug. 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/9HJE-ZFMC. \n\n7 \n \n \nsentences and harsh sentences for drug-offenders.\u201d \nUnited States v. Henry, 983 F.3d 214, 218 (6th Cir. \n2020). The Seventh Circuit has described the Act as a \n\u201chistoric, bipartisan attempt by Congress to take the \nlessons of the past and to formulate a new sentencing \npolicy for the United States.\u201d United States v. Uriarte, \n975 F.3d 596, 605 (7th Cir. 2020). And this Court has \nalready considered a handful of cases involving the \nAct in the five years since its passage. See, e.g., \nPulsifer, slip. op.; Concepcion v. United States, 142 S. \nCt. 2389 (2022); Terry v. United States, 141 S. Ct. 1858 \n(2021). Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit fr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It has a nationwide \nmembership of many thousands of direct members, \nand up to 40,000 with affiliates. NACDL\u2019s members \ninclude private criminal defense lawyers, public \ndefenders, military defense counsel, law professors, \nand \njudges. \nNACDL \nis \nthe \nonly \nnationwide \nprofessional bar association for public defenders and \nprivate criminal defense lawyers. NACDL is dedicated \nto \nadvancing \nthe \nproper, \nefficient, \nand \njust \nadministration of justice. NACDL files numerous \namicus briefs each year in the U.S. Supreme Court \nand other federal and state courts, seeking to provide \namicus assistance in cases that present issues of \nbroad importance to criminal defendants, criminal \ndefense lawyers, and the criminal justice system as a \nwhole. \nNACDL\u2019s \nmembers \nrepresent \nmany \nindividuals seeking relief under the First Step Act, \nand therefore, NACDL has a keen interest in the \napplication of Sections 401 and 403.\u00a0\n \n1 In accordance with Rule 37.2, all counsel of record received \ntimely notification of amicus\u2019s intent to file this brief. Pursuant \nto Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus certifies that no counsel for \nany party authored this brief in whole or in part, and that no \nparty or counsel other than the amicus curiae and their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \n132 Stat. 5194 (\u201cFSA\u201d), was a landmark, bipartisan \nreform to the federal criminal justice system. Its \nsentencing amendments\u2014Sections 401 and 403\u2014\nplayed a critical role in the law\u2019s passage. The \nquestion presented is whether Section 403\u2019s sentence \nreductions for firearm offenses apply to defendants \nwhose pre-enactment sentences are vacated and who \nare then resentenced post-enactment.  But resolving \nthis question will also decide how Section 401 should \nbe read. Section 401 modified sentence enhancements \nfor drug offenses\u2014the largest category of federal \ncrimes. These Section 401 reforms sought to reign in \na system of disproportionate, arbitrary punishments. \nUnder the old system, a difference of twelve years in \nprison could hinge on inconsistently applied, racially \ndisparate prosecutorial discretion that varied widely \nfrom district to district. This Court has already \ninterpreted portions of the First Step Act several \ntimes, and the provisions at issue here are equally \npressing. By granting certiorari in this case, the Court \nwill \nresolve \nthe \nnow-entrenched \ncircuit \nsplit \nundermining Congress\u2019 reforms. As a result, this \nCourt can transform the lives of those facing the \ndraconian sentences that Sections 401 and 403 sought \nto change. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT  \nI. Congress \npassed \noverdue, \nbipartisan \nsentencing reform in the First Step Act, \nimpacting tens of thousands of lives. \n1. The First Step Act is a sweeping criminal justice \nreform law, remarkable in its breadth and depth of \nsupport. Congress voted to pass the Act in 2018 by \noverwhelming margins: 87\u201312 in the Senate and 358\u2013\n36 in the House of Representatives. 164 Cong. Rec. \nS7,781 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018); 164 Cong. Rec. \nH10,430 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 2018). At its signing, \nPresident Donald J. Trump hailed the Act as \u201can \nincredible moment\u201d for criminal justice reform, and \nnoted the law\u2019s \u201cunheard of\u201d level of bipartisan \nsupport.2 The Act included three major parts: (1) \nsentencing reform through changes to the penalties \nfor some federal crimes; (2) correctional reform \nthrough creation of a Bureau of Prisons (BOP) risk \nand needs assessment system; and (3) reauthorization \nof the Second Chance Act of 2007.3  \n2. The FSA addressed the increasingly obvious \nflaws in federal sentencing. \u201cInflexible mandatory \nminimum sentences\u201d for nonviolent offenders had \ntriggered \u201can explosion in our Federal prisons,\u201d while \nfailing to \u201cdeter drug use or drug crime.\u201d 164 Cong. \nRec. S7,644 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 2018) (statement of \nSen. Durbin). Operating under rigid mandatory \n \n2 Remarks by President Trump at Signing Ceremony for S. 756, \nthe \u201cFirst Step Act of 2018\u201d and H.R. 6964, the \u201cJuvenile Justice \nReform Act of 2018,\u201d 2018 WL 6715859, at *16 (Dec. 21, 2018). \n3 Congressional Rsrch.

Construing the Act\u2019s language clearly merits \nthe Court\u2019s time\u2014particularly in the face of a \nhardened circuit conflict like this. \nII. Taking up the question presented allows this \nCourt to also interpret Section 401(c)\u2019s \nsentence reforms for drug offenses. \n  The petition presents the question of whether \nSection 403 applies to vacated sentences. Petitioner \nhas explained the importance of this provision, which \neliminates the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d firearm offenses. \nBut interpreting Section 403 also impacts those with \nvacated sentences under Section 401, which reformed \nsentence enhancements for drug offenders. United \nStates v. Bethea, 841 F. App\u2019x 544, 548 n.5 (4th Cir. \n2021) (Sections 401(c) and 403(b) construed to have \nsame meaning). Further, the Fifth Circuit has now \njoined the Sixth in a reading of these provisions that \nconflicts with the Ninth and the Third Circuits. See \nPet. 6\u20139.  Thus, the split has deepened since this \nCourt denied review of the same question presented \nin Carpenter v. United States (No. 23-531). Mr. \nHewitt\u2019s case presents the Court with the opportunity \n\n8 \n \n \nto both reconcile a circuit split and settle the meaning \nof two crucial provisions in the First Step Act\u2019s \nsentencing reforms.  \nA. Drug offenders represent the largest \ncategory of federal prisoners. \nMore federal inmates are in prison for drug \noffenses than any other category of crime. In fact, \ntwice as many individuals are in our federal prisons \nfor drug crimes (more than 44%) than for the next \nlargest \ncategory: \ncrimes \ninvolving \nweapons, \nexplosives, and arson (about 22%).10 Sixty-seven \npercent of drug offenders were convicted of an offense \ncarrying a mandatory minimum penalty and almost \nhalf of those individuals remained subject to that \npenalty at sentencing.11 On top of that mandatory \nminimum, an individual may face a sentence \nenhancement based on past offenses. A 2018 U.S. \nSentencing \nCommission \nstudy \nfound \nthat \napproximately one third of drug offenders qualified for \nsentence enhancements\u2014more than 6,000 people.12  \n \n10 Federal Bureau of Prisons, Offenses (Apr. 6, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/A7RR-39X7. \n11 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Quick Facts on Mandatory \nMinimum Penalties 2 (2022), https://perma.cc/4SNE-25VP. \n12 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Report-At-A-Glance: Federal Drug \nRecidivism Enhancements 1 (2018), https://perma.cc/XWG9-\n5JW8. \n\n9 \n \n \nB. Section 401 mitigated the frequency and \nseverity of sentence enhancements for \ndrug offenses, helping to remedy the \nharsh and arbitrary application of these \npenalties. \n1. Section 401 changed the mandatory-minimum \nsentencing enhancements under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and the \nControlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 951 et seq. Prosecutors may seek sentence \nenhancements \nbased \non \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nprior \nconvictions by following the proceedings described in \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.13 Sentencing enhancements under \nboth \nlaws \nare \ntherefore \nknown \nas \n\u201c851 \nenhancements.\u201d14  \n2. Prior to the First Step Act, 851 enhancements \nforced judges to levy harsh penalties on drug \noffenders. The enhancement for a defendant with a \nsingle qualifying drug offense was a mandatory \nminimum of twenty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) \n(amended 2018). If the defendant had two or more \nqualifying offenses, that mandatory minimum became \nlife. Id. Moreover, the old law set a low bar for what \nconstituted a qualifying drug offense\u2014any drug crime \npunishable by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment \nsufficed, including simple possession. See id. \u00a7 802(44) \n \n13 Section 962 of the Controlled Substances Act incorporates by \nreference the procedures stated in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, making \nSection 851 the operative provision across both statutes. 21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 962. \n14 See, e.g., U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of \nSection 851 Enhancements (July 2018), https://perma.cc/7NXA-\n4ZLP. \n\n10 \n \n \n(defining a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as one punishable by \nimprisonment for more than one year). This definition \nswept in defendants who were sentenced to less than \na year, released before a year was up, or were \nsentenced to probation alone. An individual who had \nbeen convicted of one prior felony drug offense twenty \nyears \nearlier \ncould \nget \nthe \nsame \nsentence \nenhancement as someone who had been found guilty \nof the same offense only one year ago. The system \ntreated all felony drug offenders identically. \nThese sentence enhancements were not only \ndraconian; they were also inconsistently applied.  A \n2011 study on mandatory minimum sentences found \nthat in most judicial districts, between one quarter \nand one half of all drug offenders qualified for a \nsentence enhancement; in a third of districts, the rate \nwas as high as 50% to 75%.15 The number of \ndefendants actually sentenced with enhancements \nwas lower, but worryingly, the Commission found \n\u201csignificant variation in the manner in which the \nenhancement provision was applied.\u201d 2011 Report, \nsupra, at 260. For example, in six districts more than \n75% of eligible defendants received the enhancement, \nbut in eight districts, no eligible offenders received it. \nId. at 260\u201361. Based on these findings, the \n \n15 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 2011 Report to the Congress: \nMandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice \nSystem 260 (2011), https://perma.cc/DT3U-D3RR [hereinafter \n2011 Report]. \n\n11 \n \n \nCommission recommended that Congress \u201creassess \nthe severity and scope of 851 enhancements.\u201d16 \nIn early 2018, the Commission undertook a study \nwholly focused on 851 enhancements. The report \nfound that, although almost a third of drug offenders \nqualified for sentence enhancements, application of \nthe enhancements continued to vary wildly, \u201cranging \nfrom five districts in which an 851 enhancement was \nsought against more than 50% of eligible drug \ntrafficking offenders to nineteen districts in which the \nenhancement was not sought against any of the \neligible offenders.\u201d17 Further, the report unearthed \ntroubling racial disparities. Black offenders accounted \nfor 42% of those who qualified for sentence \nenhancements but made up a staggering 58% of those \nwho received enhancements. 2018 Report, supra, at \n34 tbl.5.  By contrast, 26% of white offenders were \neligible for enhancements, yet only 24% received \nthem. Id.  \nDefendants suffered major consequences if a court \nsentenced them under the enhanced sentencing \nregime. The Commission found that, if a prosecutor \nchose not to seek an enhanced sentence, offenders \notherwise eligible for the enhancement received an \naverage sentence of seven years. Id. at 7. By contrast, \nwhen the prosecutor did seek the enhancement, it \n \n16 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of Section \n851 \nEnhancements: \nKey \nFindings \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/RL7S-BV84. \n17 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking \nOffenders \n6 \n(July \n2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/AKH6-7WTS \n[hereinafter 2018 Report]. \n\n12 \n \n \nadded another twelve years to the sentence on \naverage, more than doubling the individual\u2019s time in \nprison. Id. In other words, similarly situated \ndefendants were receiving sentences that varied by \nmore than a decade\u2014seven years for some and \nnineteen years for others. The data depicted an \narbitrary system, where punishment turned not on \nthe actions of the defendant, but on the prosecutor and \ndistrict in which the defendant was sentenced.   \n3. Section 401 of the First Step Act sought to \nmitigate the severity of 851 enhancements in two \nways. First, the provision restricted which crimes \nqualified as predicates for most mandatory-minimum \nsentences. Only drug trafficking offenses for which \nthe defendant had served more than twelve months of \nimprisonment now qualified. First Step Act of 2018, \nPub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 401(a)(1), 132 Stat. 5194, 5221, \n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(57). Additionally, offenses that were \nmore than fifteen years old could no longer support an \nenhanced sentence. Id. Second, Section 401 reduced \nthe severity of sentence enhancements. For example, \nfor a defendant convicted under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) who \nhas a single prior qualifying offense, the mandatory \nminimum enhancement dropped from twenty to \nfifteen \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 401(a)(2)(A)(i), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).  If the same defendant had two prior \nqualifying \noffenses, \nthe \nmandatory \nminimum \nenhancement changed from life in prison to twenty-\nfive \nyears. \nId. \n\u00a7 \n401(a)(2)(A)(ii), \n21 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because of these changes, defendants \nwith two predicate offenses sentenced today have the \nchance to return home to their families instead of \nspending their lives in prison.  \n\n13 \n \n \nThe amendments made an immediate impact. \nDrug offenders receiving enhanced penalties dropped \nfrom 1,001 in 2018 to 849 in 2019.18 In 2018, the \ntwenty-year enhanced mandatory minimum had been \napplied to 321 offenders. Id. In 2019, the revised \nfifteen-year minimum was applied to 219 people. Id. \nIn 2018, enhanced sentencing consigned forty-two \ndrug offenders to life in prison. Id. In 2019, that \nnumber dropped to eleven. Id.  \n4. By narrowing the pool of eligible defendants and \nlessening the length of enhanced sentences, Section \n401 of the First Step Act mitigated the system\u2019s worst \nexcesses. Still, the harshness of the old regime follows \ndefendants who were originally sentenced before the \nAct\u2019s passage and whose sentences have now been \nvacated. With the courts of appeals openly at odds, \nonly geography dictates whether an individual will \nbenefit from the FSA\u2019s changes. For the typical \ndefendant eligible for an 851 sentence enhancement, \nthe difference amounts to years, if not decades, of \nextra time in prison.  \nThe FSA\u2019s sentencing modifications garnered \nbipartisan support and have transformed numerous \nlives over the last five years. Yet the entrenched \ncircuit conflict prevents Sections 401 and 403 from \napplying nationwide. It is time for this Court to take \nup the question presented and construe the law\u2019s \nreforms as Congress intended. \n \n18 See U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, The First Step Act of 2018: One \nYear of Implementation (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/QMZ5-\nYKC7. \n\n14 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \ngrant certiorari.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nJeffrey T.

          "task_beliefs": "My current understanding of the legal landscape in *Hewitt v. United States* remains stable, as the latest observation was an internal reasoning step that confirmed my analytical strategy rather than introducing new external evidence. My beliefs, built upon previous observations, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument Framework (Stable):** My detailed understanding of the petitioner's case remains the core of my belief state. The argument rests on a three-pronged approach:\n    *   **Textual Interpretation:** The central claim is that a vacated sentence is *void ab initio* (a legal nullity). Therefore, for the purposes of the First Step Act's applicability clause\u2014Section 403(b), which refers to sentences that \"ha[ve] been imposed as of such date of enactment\"\u2014Hewitt had no legally effective sentence in place when the Act passed. The use of the present-perfect tense (\"has been imposed\") is argued to require that the sentence not only have been imposed but also remain legally valid at the time of enactment.\n    *   **Precedent and Legal Principles:** This textual argument is supported by established legal doctrines. The petitioner relies heavily on the principle that a vacated judgment has no legal effect (*Burks v. United States*). Furthermore, they argue that a *de novo* resentencing is a new proceeding where the court must apply the law as it currently stands, including the First Step Act (*Pepper v. United States*).\n    *   **Canons of Construction:** The petitioner has a fallback argument based on the rule of lenity, asserting that any ambiguity in the statute must be resolved in favor of the defendant, a principle supported by cases like *United States v. Granderson*.\n\n2.  **Congressional Intent (Stable):** The petitioner's brief effectively frames the issue as a matter of fulfilling Congress's clear purpose to end the \"unjust\" practice of sentence stacking. Re-imposing a stacked sentence post-Act would, in their view, directly contravene this legislative goal.\n\n3.  **Executive Branch Position (Stable and Contextualized):** The Solicitor General's \"confession of error\" is a significant signal. My belief is that the government finds the petitioner's textual and purposive arguments persuasive, specifically the interpretation that a vacated sentence is not one that \"has been imposed\" under Section 403(b). This alignment between the two parties substantially increases the likelihood of a reversal of the Fifth Circuit's decision.\n\n4.  **Analytical Path Forward (Refined):** The latest observation did not add new facts about the case but reinforced the structure of my predictive model. It confirmed that while I have a robust understanding of the arguments *for* the petitioner, my model is incomplete without a symmetrical understanding of the arguments *against* them. The observation solidified my belief that the single most critical piece of missing information is the brief from the court-appointed amicus curiae. This brief is designed to present the strongest possible defense of the Fifth Circuit's judgment and will supply the counterarguments that the Justices will consider. My predictive confidence remains high for the petitioner, but it is contingent on the strength and nature of the arguments that will be presented by the amicus. My next update will be critically dependent on analyzing those counterarguments.",

All also agree that it deepens at least a 2-2 circuit \nsplit\u2014one that cannot and will not resolve itself. That \nleaves no doubt that the Court should grant the petition \nand reverse, restoring uniformity on the question pre-\nsented and ensuring that the First Step Act is applied \naccording to its plain terms. \nNotwithstanding the Fifth Circuit\u2019s admitted error \nand the Solicitor General\u2019s acknowledgment of a division \nof authority among the courts of appeals, the government \nstrangely resists this Court\u2019s intervention. As the govern-\nment sees it, review is unnecessary because (1) the issue \nhas limited prospective importance and (2) there is a long-\nstalled bill pending before Congress which, if enacted, \nwould amend the First Step Act.  \nNeither assertion is remotely persuasive. If the de-\ncision below is left to stand, untold numbers of indivi-\nduals will continue to be denied often decades-long \nsentence reductions to which they are entitled by law. \nAnd as the government begrudgingly admits, the question \npresented is certain to recur as changes in the law con-\ntinue to crop up. The Court should not delay resolution of \nthe issue any longer.  \n1. The government agrees that the decision below \ndeepens a circuit split: Whereas \u201c[t]he Third and Ninth \nCircuits * * * have both correctly interpreted Section 403 \nto apply at a resentencing held following the Act\u2019s enact-\nment,\u201d the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have reached the op-\nposite conclusion. See BIO 9-10.  \nIn an attempt to trivialize this point, the government \nasserts (at 9) that \u201cthe disagreement in the courts of \nappeals is shallow and recent.\u201d But that is plainly wrong. \n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nThe split is two years old, and it emerged almost immedi-\nately after the FSA was enacted. That the statute spawned \na circuit split nearly from the start is a reason to grant \nreview, not the other way around. In all events, a 2-2 \ndivision of authority that is widely recognized and firmly \nentrenched is plainly worthy of the Court\u2019s attention.  \nThat is especially so here, given that two dozen fed-\neral appellate judges sitting on four circuit courts have \nissued ten fully considered opinions\u2014majorities, concur-\nrences, dissents, and opinions respecting rehearing\u2014that \nhave openly approved or criticized the conflicting views \nof their colleagues all across the country. And that is to \nsay nothing of the unpublished decisions of the Second \nand Fourth Circuits and the on-point opinion of the en \nbanc Seventh Circuit.1 Given the extensive treatment that \nthe question presented already has received, there is \nnothing to be gained from further percolation.  \nThe now-entrenched nature of the circuit split also \nexplains the irrelevance of the denial of review in Carpen-\nter v. United States, No. 23-531. See BIO 9. As we noted \nin the petition (at 1, 6-7), the government there stated that \nit would attempt to resolve the circuit split by acquiescing \n \n1  See Pet. App. 1a-16a; United States v. Carpenter, 80 F.4th 790 (6th \nCir. 2023) (Kethledge, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc); \nid. at 793-795 (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en \nbanc); id. at 795-797 (Bloomekatz, J., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc); United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th 382 (3d Cir. \n2022); id. at 392-393 (Bibas, J., concurring in the judgment); United \nStates v.

But the Sixth \nCircuit rebuffed the government, and the Fifth Circuit has \nsince solidified the conflict beyond any one circuit\u2019s \nability to resolve. This Court is thus the only tribunal that \ncan end the dispute among the lower courts. \n2.  The question presented is exceptionally important. \nTo begin, the sentencing disparities at issue here are  \nhuge. Whether the First Step Act applies to a criminal \ndefendant often makes a difference of decades or cen-\nturies of incarceration. The Court and Congress both have \ncalled out the injustice of \u201cunwarranted sentencing \ndisparities\u201d like this. Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. \n260, 277 (2012). For many individuals, the question \npresented is the difference between liberty and detention; \nfor them, it is of utmost importance. \nMoreover, the question arises with great frequency, \nnot only under Section 403 of the Act, but also in cases \nimplicating Section 401. See BIO 12 n.3. Many thousands \nof defendants every year have been subject to the sen-\ntencing enhancements implicated by Sections 401 and \n403. See NACDL Br. 7-8; ACLU Br. 12-14.  \nAlthough it is true that the question presented can \narise only for defendants who committed offenses before \nDecember 2018, the government is wrong to imply (at 12) \nthat the range of cases in which the question presented \narises will meaningfully \u201cdiminish\u201d any time soon. The \nwhole point is that the terms of imprisonment at issue \nhere are many decades, sometimes centuries, long. Thus, \nfor decades to come, the question presented will arise \nevery time there is a change in law that can be raised on \ncollateral review in cases involving convictions that fall \nwithin the reach of Section 401 or  403\u2014which is most \nfederal convictions. NACDL Br. 7-8. \n\n4 \n \n \n \n \nGiven these facts, it is perhaps unsurprising that, just \na few months ago, the government argued to the Sixth \nCircuit that \u201crestoring uniformity among the circuits\u201d on \nthe question presented is a matter \u201cof exceptional impor-\ntance.\u201d See U.S. Rehearing Br. 1-2, Carpenter v. United \nStates, No. 22-1198 (6th Cir. Aug. 7, 2023). It was \ncorrect then, and it is wrong to suggest otherwise now.  \n3. The government makes a final pitch for denial, \nnoting in passing (at 9, 13) that a bill has been introduced \nthat would amend the First Step Act so that it applies \nretroactively. The bill that the government references, the \nFirst Step Implementation Act, was first introduced in \n2021 but died without receiving a floor vote. It was \nreintroduced in the Senate more than one year ago, in \nApril 2023. In the time since, it has not received so much \nas a committee hearing, let alone has it been voted out of \ncommittee, debated on the chamber floor, voted upon by \nthe full Senate, or moved to the House.  \nGiven the approaching end to the 118th Congress, \nthere is no realistic possibility that the bill will be enacted \nbefore it dies again at the end of the year. And it would be \nmanifestly unjust to allow continued misapplication of a \nlaw that has been enacted out of speculative concern for a \nbill that never will be. \nIn circumstances like these, the Court often grants re-\nview notwithstanding a respondent\u2019s assertion that Con-\ngress is currently considering legislation that, if adopted, \nwould affect the question presented.2 That is the approp-\n \n2  See, e.g., BIO 13, Kelly v.

My prior beliefs about the petitioner's case and the government's position remain stable, but they are now contextualized within a much larger framework.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument Framework (Stable):** My belief in the strength of the petitioner's three-pronged argument remains unchanged. The case rests on a textual interpretation of Section 403(b)'s \"has been imposed\" language, supported by the legal principle that a vacated sentence is a nullity (*Burks v. United States*), the requirement to apply current law at a *de novo* resentencing (*Pepper v. United States*), and the rule of lenity.\n\n2.  **Executive Branch Position (Stable):** The Solicitor General's confession of error continues to be a powerful signal favoring reversal. The government's alignment with the petitioner on the core textual argument remains a key factor in my predictive model.\n\n3.  **Broadened Scope and Stakes of the Case (New and Significant Update):** The amicus brief from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) reveals that the legal question's impact is far greater than I previously understood.\n    *   **Parallel Interpretation with Section 401:** The NACDL brief establishes that the applicability clause in Section 403(b) (for firearms) is construed identically to the clause in Section 401(c) (for drug offenses), citing *United States v. Bethea*. Therefore, the Court's ruling in *Hewitt* will directly control whether the FSA's reforms to mandatory minimums for drug offenses apply to defendants resentenced after the Act's passage.\n    *   **Vastly Increased Impact:** This linkage is critical because, as the NACDL brief points out, drug offenders constitute the single largest category of federal prisoners (over 44%). The ruling will thus affect a much larger population than just those sentenced under the \u00a7 924(c) stacking provision. This raises the national significance of the case and the pressure on the Court to resolve the circuit split.\n\n4.  **Reinforced Purposive Argument (Updated and Strengthened):** The NACDL brief adds significant factual and emotional weight to the argument about Congressional intent.\n    *   **Evidence of \"Draconian\" System:** The brief provides specific data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission showing the pre-FSA sentencing regime for drug offenses was not just harsh but also \"arbitrary\" and marked by \"troubling racial disparities.\" For example, it highlights that a sentence could vary by as much as twelve years depending on prosecutorial discretion in a given district.\n    *   **Fulfilling Bipartisan Intent:** By detailing the \"overdue, bipartisan\" nature of the First Step Act and its documented success in reducing recidivism, the brief frames a ruling against Hewitt as a direct frustration of Congress's clear, effective, and widely supported legislative goal.\n\n5.  **Analytical Gap Remains Critical (Stable but Emphasized):** The observation failed to return the court-appointed amicus brief in support of the judgment below. This confirms that my model's primary source of uncertainty\u2014the lack of a robust articulation of the counterarguments\u2014persists. While the evidence and arguments supporting the petitioner have grown stronger and broader, I still lack the opposing view that the Justices will consider. My confidence in a pro-petitioner outcome has increased due to the heightened stakes and reinforced purposive arguments, but a complete prediction requires understanding the best case for the other side. The acquisition of the court-appointed amicus brief is now the single most important step to finalizing my prediction.",

HEWITT, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nNo. 23-1150 \nCOREY DEYON DUFFEY AND JARVIS DUPREE ROSS, \nPETITIONERS \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR RESPONDENT \nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS \n \nAs the government explained in its opening brief, \nSection 403(b) of the First Step Act\u2014which \u201cappl[ies]\u201d \nSection 403\u2019s ameliorated sentencing scheme \u201cif a sen-\ntence for the offense has not been imposed as of [the \nAct\u2019s] date of enactment,\u201d \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5222\u2014 \ncovers an offender who no longer has a sentence im-\nposed for that offense.  An offender whose pre-Act sen-\ntence has been vacated\u2014and thus needs a sentence to \nbe \u201cimpose[d]\u201d under 18 U.S.C. 3553\u2014is not an offender \non whom \u201ca sentence * * * has * * * been imposed\u201d un-\nder Section 403(b). \n\n2 \n \nAmicus cannot dispute that his alternative reading \nwould require district courts to sentence such offenders \nto decades of imprisonment under a scheme that the \nsame Congress discarded as overly harsh, while provid-\ning no offsetting benefit in protecting the finality of \ncriminal judgments.  He nonetheless insists (Br. 15-29) \nthat the text cannot be read any other way.  In making \nthat assertion, he reads Congress\u2019s choice of the  \npresent-perfect tense\u2014which focuses on continuation\u2014\nout of the statute.  If Congress had wanted amicus\u2019s ver-\nsion of the statute, it would have used the past-perfect \ntense\u2014but there is no foothold in the statute  to turn \n\u201chas\u201d into \u201chad.\u201d \nAmicus\u2019s effort to find support in the wording of \nother statutes disregards the most pertinent one, 18 \nU.S.C. 3582(c), which is worded similarly and plainly fo-\ncuses on continuing validity.  Amicus\u2019s arguments about \nhow Congress could have written Section 403(b) more \nclearly cut just as strongly against his proposed inter-\npretation and disregard the import of what Congress \ndid write.  And contrary to amicus\u2019s alternative argu-\nment, Section 403(b)\u2019s \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause does not require a \ncourt to completely ignore everything that happened af-\nter the Act\u2019s enactment.   \nNor can amicus identify any sound reason why Con-\ngress, in enacting such a major sentencing reform, \nwould have chosen to exclude pre-Act offenders who \nneed fresh sentences from the Act\u2019s reformations.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 and the government\u2019s understanding of Sec-\ntion 403(b) honors both the particular words that Con-\ngress chose and the evident purpose of the provision it \ncrafted.  Amicus\u2019s reading does neither.  This Court \nshould reject it and reverse the judgments below. \n\n3 \n \nA. Amicus Fails To Show That Validity Is Irrelevant Under \nSection 403(b) \nAs the government has explained, whether \u201ca sen-\ntence for the offense has  * * *  been imposed\u201d under \nSection 403(b) turns on the continuing existence of a \nvalid sentencing judgment.  U.S. Br. 16-20.  Congress\u2019s \nuse of the present-perfect tense indicates that the sen-\ntence at issue is one that remains valid in the present\u2014\ni.e., at the time of the sentencing proceeding to which \nSection 403(b) is relevant.  Id. at 17-19.  Congress\u2019s ref-\nerence to \u201ca sentence,\u201d rather than \u201cany sentence,\u201d \nwhen describing the triggering condition underscores \nthat interpretation.  Id. at 19-20.  Amicus does not show \notherwise. \n1. Amicus\u2019s textual arguments cannot overcome Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense \nAt bottom, amicus\u2019s reading of the text transforms \n\u201chas\u201d into \u201chad.\u201d  That revision of the present-perfect \ntense into the past-perfect tense is impermissible.  As \n\u201cthe Dictionary Act instructs,\u201d \u201cthe present tense gen-\nerally does not include the past.\u201d  Carr v. United States, \n560 U.S. 438, 448 (2010). \na. Amicus observes that an ordinary speaker could \nuse the word \u201cimposed\u201d to refer to the historical fact \nthat a sentence was pronounced.  See, e.g., North Caro-\nlina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 713-714 (1969) (discussing \na sentence \u201coriginally imposed\u201d and describing a hold-\ning that \u201cthe longer sentence imposed upon retrial was \nunconstitutional and void\u201d) (citation and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  But an ordinary speaker could \nalso use \u201cimposed\u201d to refer to a legally operative sen-\ntence.  For example, if a prison official asks \u201cIs a death \nsentence imposed on Jones?\u201d, when Jones had once \n\n4 \n \nbeen sentenced to death but received a life sentence af-\nter a retrial, the correct answer would be \u201cNo.\u201d   \nThat is the sense in which \u201cimposed\u201d is used in Sec-\ntion 403(b), which differs markedly in form from the ex-\namples on which amicus relies.  Amicus\u2019s examples all \nuse the participle \u201cimposed\u201d as an adjective.  See Ami-\ncus Br. 21-22, 30-31 (\u201cthe death sentences imposed for \narmed robbery, however, were vacated\u201d; \u201cthe sentence \noriginally imposed on those particular counts\u201d; \u201cre-\nceive a longer sentence than the one originally im-\nposed\u201d) (emphases altered; brackets and citations omit-\nted).  Section 403(b), however, uses \u201cimposed\u201d as a verb:  \n\u201chas  * * *  been imposed.\u201d  And the verb tense Congress \nused\u2014the present-perfect\u2014clarifies that the provision \nrefers to a legally operative sentence.  See U.S. Br. 16-\n17, 20-22.  Section 403(b) therefore does not encompass \nsentences that have been vacated. \nTo take one of amicus\u2019s own examples, see Amicus \nBr. 21, saying \u201c[t]he death sentences [that were] im-\nposed for armed robbery  * * *  were vacated\u201d comports \nwith ordinary speech; saying \u201cthe death sentences [that \nare] imposed for armed robbery  * * * were vacated\u201d \ndoes not.  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 161-162 \n(1976).  Or, even more pertinently, saying \u201c[t]he death \nsentence[] [that had been] imposed for armed robbery  \n* * *  w[as] vacated\u201d comports with ordinary speech; \nsaying \u201cthe death sentence[] [that has been] imposed for \narmed robbery  * * *  w[as] vacated\u201d does not.  Ibid.1   \n \n1  Amicus\u2019s citation (Br. 22) of 18 U.S.C. 3742(f)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \n2255(a), which provide for relief in certain circumstances if \u201cthe sen-\ntence was imposed in violation\u201d of the law, cut against his reading.  \nIn both cases, the phrase refers to a sentence that remains in force \nat the relevant time.  See 18 U.S.C. 3742 (discussing relief following \n \n\n5 \n \nb. Amicus is wrong to suggest (Br. 24-27) that the \npresent-perfect tense supports his own reading.  Ami-\ncus cites Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage for the prop-\nosition that the present-perfect tense \u201csometimes rep-\nresents an action as having been completed at some in-\ndefinite time in the past.\u201d  Amicus Br. 25 (citing Bryan \nA. Garner, Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage 1082 (5th \ned. 2022) (Garner)).  But on the very same page that \namicus cites, Garner explains that it would be \u201cerror\u201d to \nuse the present-perfect tense where \u201cthe action is \nwholly in the past\u2014and the time is relatively definite.\u201d  \nGarner 1082 (emphasis added).  That is the very error \nthat amicus makes when he reads Section 403(b) to  \nrefer\u2014using the present-perfect tense\u2014to sentences \nthat are no longer valid because the imposition of a sen-\ntence \u201coccurs at a fixed point in time.\u201d  Amicus Br. 25 \n(emphasis added; citation omitted). \nRelatedly, amicus\u2019s interpretation violates the prin-\nciple that the present-perfect tense \u201cis not used in con-\ntexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of\u200a\u201d a time period \u201cis \nexplicitly or implicitly excluded.\u201d  Rodney Huddleston \n& Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the \nEnglish Language 143 (2002).  An ordinary English \nspeaker might say that \u201cAlice had visited the park doz-\nens of times before its closure last year.\u201d  But the \nspeaker could not equivalently substitute the statement \n \n\u201creview of an otherwise final sentence\u201d under subsection (a) or (b) \nof the statute); 28 U.S.C. 2255(a) (allowing a claim by \u201c[a] prisoner  \n* * *  under sentence of a court  * * *  claiming  * * *  that the \nsentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States\u201d) (emphasis added).  A legal flaw in a previously in-\nvalidated sentence would obviously provide no basis for relief under \neither statute. \n\n6 \n \nthat \u201cAlice has visited that park dozens of times,\u201d be-\ncause that statement implies that the park remains \nopen to visitors.  And that latter statement is analogous \nto the phrasing that Congress employed in Section \n403(b)\u2014just replacing open parks with operative sen-\ntences. \nc. Amicus contends that if Congress intended to ex-\nclude only defendants whose sentences remained valid, \nit might have spoken more clearly, for instance by re-\nferring to \u201ca valid sentence,\u201d \u201cthe sentence,\u201d or (some-\nwhat more verbosely) \u201ca sentence that continues to le-\ngally bind the defendant.\u201d  Amicus Br. 17 (citation and \nemphases omitted).  But Congress had various reasons \nto eschew each of amicus\u2019s proposed reformulations.  A \nreference to \u201cthe sentence,\u201d for example, might have \nbeen interpreted to capture only cases that had reached \na final disposition, allowing any defendant with a pend-\ning appeal to reopen his validly imposed sentence.  See \nU.S. Br. 25 & n.3.  And a reference to \u201ca valid sentence\u201d \ncould have raised questions about the degree to which \nSection 403(b) allowed collateral attacks on sentences \nthat were already final. \nAmicus\u2019s reliance (Br. 32) on 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), \nwhich he identifies as a model for an express carveout \nof \u201cvacated sentences or convictions,\u201d actually under-\nmines his argument.  Section 921(a)(20) defines a rele-\nvant \u201cconviction\u201d for certain firearms laws to exclude \n\u201c[a]ny conviction which,\u201d among other things, \u201chas been \nexpunged[] or set aside.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20).  The  \npresent-perfect tense there obviously refers to an ex-\npungement with continuing validity:  a defendant with a \ncurrently valid conviction cannot, for example, lawfully \npossess a firearm simply because the conviction was \nonce erroneously expunged but later reinstated.  See 18 \n\n7 \n \nU.S.C. 922(g); cf. Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, \n64 (1980). \nIn any event, amicus himself ultimately acknowl-\nedges that the possibility that \u201cCongress could have ex-\npressed itself more clearly\u201d is not a reason to depart \nfrom the best interpretation of the statute that it did \nenact.  Amicus Br. 18 (quoting Luna Torres v. Lynch, \n578 U.S. 452, 472-473 (2016)).  And any potential basis \nfor faulting Congress for not choosing some purport-\nedly clearer alternative disappears entirely where, as \nhere, Congress could have been clearer in either direc-\ntion.  See U.S. Br. 31; Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. \n124, 138 (2024).  A Congress that wanted amicus\u2019s ap-\nproach could have referred to an \u201cinitial sentence\u201d or \nother clearer alternative, see U.S. Br. 31\u2014or could have \nsimply worded the provision to apply to a defendant who \n\u201chad never been sentenced.\u201d \n2. Amicus\u2019s reading does not accord with statutory con-\ntext \nAs the government has explained, the broader stat-\nutory context further supports the ordinary inference \nthat follows from Section 403(b)\u2019s use of the present-\nperfect tense.  See U.S. Br. 22-23.  Amicus fails even to \nrespond to the government\u2019s observations about the \nmost analogous provision, and his attempt to draw sup-\nport from unrelated statutes is misplaced. \na. The most informative piece of the contextual \nbackdrop is Congress\u2019s use of the same language that \nappears in Section 403(b)\u2014\u201chas * * * been imposed\u201d\u2014\nin the closely related context of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c).  See \nU.S. Br. 22-23.  Section 3582 provides that, except in \ncertain delimited circumstances, \u201c[t]he court may not \nmodify a term of imprisonment once it has been im-\n\n8 \n \nposed.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3582(c); see U.S. Br. 22-23.  That lan-\nguage unequivocally refers to sentences that remain \nvalid; a court is free to deviate from a previously im-\nposed sentence that was vacated, notwithstanding that, \nas a matter of historical fact, it was at one point im-\nposed.  See Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 507 \n(2011). \nAmicus does not acknowledge Section 3582(c) at all.  \nThat omission is glaring because the critical language \nof Section 403(b) mirrors the language of Section \n3582(c).  Section 403(b) applies when \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed,\u201d \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5222 \n(emphasis added); Section 3582(c) applies to \u201ca term of \nimprisonment once it has been imposed,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n3582(c) (emphasis added).  The \u201chas  * * *  been im-\nposed\u201d language is thus most naturally understood the \nsame way in both places.  Amicus\u2019s failure to reconcile \nCongress\u2019s use of \u201chas  * * *  been imposed\u201d in Section \n403(b) with its use of the same language in Section \n3582(c) makes his historical-fact reading particularly in-\ncongruous. \nb. Though he does not address Section 3582(c), ami-\ncus points to other statutes, involving confirmation of \nbankruptcy plans and other nonsentencing matters, \nthat use the present-perfect tense.  See Amicus Br. 27 \n& nn.4-5.  But amicus has not identified any instances \nwhere a court has read any of those provisions in the \nmanner he urges here, i.e., to apply to an event that hap-\npened in the past but no longer holds force, such as a \nreopened bankruptcy plan. \nNor can amicus dispute that still other statutes use \nthe past-perfect tense to convey the type of meaning \nthat he would attribute to Section 403(b)\u2019s use of the \npresent-perfect tense.  See U.S. Br. 18.  Thus, even his \n\n9 \n \nefforts to survey the entirety of the U.S. Code do not \nmove the needle in his direction.  The provisions he in-\nvokes instead simply confirm that Congress had a \nchoice of tenses, and here used the present-perfect\u2014a \nchoice that signals continuing validity, rather than a \nblinkered focus on the past. \n3. No background rule resolves this case  \na. Amicus is correct that there is no general back-\nground rule that a vacated conviction or sentence is void \nab initio and so \u201cmust be disregarded for all purposes.\u201d  \nAmicus Br. 31 (capitalization omitted); see id. at 33-39; \nbut see Hewitt Br. 17-21; Duffey Br. 16-28.  Sometimes, \nthe historical fact of a conviction or sentence is itself \nrelevant.  See U.S. Br. 16, 26 & n.4.  Other times\u2014like \nhere\u2014it is important that a particular conviction or sen-\ntence remains operative.  See id. at 14-26; see pp. 3-9, \nsupra. \nThe issue is statute-specific, and no background rule \nsupports either petitioners\u2019 \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d position or \namicus\u2019s own \u201chistorical fact\u201d position, as illustrated by \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Lewis v. United States, on which \namicus himself relies (Br. 31-32).  Lewis addressed a \nprohibition on firearm possession by \u201c[a]ny person who  \n* * *  has been convicted  * * *  of a felony.\u201d  445 U.S. at \n56 n.1.  And the Court\u2019s consideration of invalid or va-\ncated convictions there cannot be squared with a one-\nsize-fits-all rule like the ones that amicus and petition-\ners propose. \nThe Court did not embrace a void ab initio approach, \ninstead making clear that a defendant generally would \nviolate the statute so long as he had a prior conviction \non the books when he possessed a firearm, even if that \nconviction turned out to be constitutionally infirm.  See \nLewis, 445 U.S. at 60-61.  At the same time, the Court \n\n10 \n \ndid not embrace a historical fact approach, indicating \nthat the statute permitted firearm possession if a de-\nfendant secured vacatur of a prior conviction \u201cbefore ob-\ntaining a firearm,\u201d even though the defendant had at \nsome point been convicted in the past.  Id. at 64; see id. \nat 61 n.5.  So too here, the Court should not presump-\ntively embrace either amicus\u2019s or petitioners\u2019 approach \nas a background rule. \nb. Amicus\u2019s effort (Br. 39-40) to invoke the back-\nground rule of the federal saving statute, 1 U.S.C. 109, \nis likewise misplaced.  Section 109 provides that the \npenalty scheme in effect at the time of the offense ap-\nplies unless the \u201c\u200a\u2018plain import\u2019 or \u2018fair implication,\u2019\u200a\u201d of \na new criminal statute is \u201cto apply its new penalties to a \nset of pre-Act offenders.\u201d  Dorsey v. United States, 567 \nU.S. 260, 275 (2012).  And even on amicus\u2019s own reading, \nSection 403(b) supplies the necessary \u201cfair implication.\u201d \nIf the saving statute\u2019s default rule applied, then even \nthe initial sentencings of defendants who committed \ntheir crimes before the First Step Act\u2019s enactment \nwould be subject to the harsher pre-Act penalties.  But \namicus does not urge that result; it is therefore common \nground that Section 403(b) supplants the default rule.  \nAnd amicus identifies (Br. 40) no authority for the prop-\nosition that where, as here, Congress has enacted a stat-\nute that clearly overrides the default rule, it must none-\ntheless rebut that rule\u2019s application to every possible \ncircumstance that might arise under that statute. \nB. Amicus\u2019s Additional Arguments Are Unsound \nAmicus\u2019s further arguments are either back-channel \nefforts to bolster his transformation of \u201chas\u201d into \u201chad,\u201d \nor attempts to minimize the implications of the present-\nperfect tense\u2019s focus on continuing validity.  Both sets \nof contentions lack merit.   \n\n11 \n \n1. Amicus\u2019s reliance on the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause is misplaced   \na. In trying to defuse Congress\u2019s choice of verb \ntense, amicus maintains that using the past-perfect \ntense would have \u201cma[de] no sense\u201d because Section \n403(b) asks if a sentence has been imposed \u201cas of such \ndate of enactment,\u201d which amicus reads to mean \u201c\u200a\u2018as of \ntoday,\u2019 when we (Congress) enact this law.\u201d  Amicus Br. \n25-26 (citation omitted).  He argues that a statute writ-\nten with the past-perfect tense, asking whether \u201ca sen-\ntence for the offense had not been imposed as of today,\u201d \nwould have been \u201ca syntactical hash\u201d if read on the pre-\ncise date of the statute\u2019s enactment.  Id. at 26 (brackets \nand citation omitted).  But amicus\u2019s premise\u2014that the \nprovision was written to be read only on the one specific \nday on which it was enacted\u2014disregards basic precepts \nof statutory drafting. \nStatutory provisions typically do not require the \nreader to travel back in time; instead, they are gener-\nally drafted to \u201cspeak[] as of whatever time [they are] \nbeing read (rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or \nput into effect).\u201d  The Office of the Legis. Counsel, U.S. \nHouse of Reps., House Legislative Counsel\u2019s Manual \non Drafting Style \u00a7 102(c), at 5 (Dec. 2022).  Section \n403(b) should therefore be presumed to have been writ-\nten from the perspective of the judges who would later \nread and apply it\u2014for whom it would no longer be De-\ncember 21, 2018.  And from the perspective of a judge \nabout to conduct a sentencing, the use of the past- \nperfect tense (\u201chad\u201d) would have been not only sensible \n\n12 \n \nbut preferable if Section 403(b) in fact had the meaning \nthat amicus ascribes to it.2 \nb. For similar reasons, amicus is wrong to suggest \n(Br. 2-3, 12-13, 20, 25-26, 29) that even if \u201ca sentence\u201d \nthat \u201chas * * * been imposed\u201d does indeed refer to a \nsentence with continuing validity, the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause lim-\nits the validity to a specific time period.  As amicus \nwould have it, the effect of the clause would be that the \nsentence\u2019s validity need only have continued until De-\ncember 21, 2018\u2014after which, for amicus, all bets are \noff.  That, however, is not the clause\u2019s function. \nInstead, the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause simply clarifies when Sec-\ntion 403(a) begins to apply:  namely, on the date of its \nenactment.  Whether or not that would have been pre-\nsumed in the absence of such a specification, Congress \nhas regularly included similar language in other stat-\nutes.3  The inclusion of such typical \u201cas of\u200a\u201d phrasing in \nSection 403(b) does not require a court conducting a re-\nsentencing to turn a blind eye to everything that hap-\npened after December 21, 2018\u2014including even the \nvery invalidation that precipitated the resentencing. \n \n2  In any event, there would be nothing unusual about asking \nwhether an event had occurred before today.  \u201cHad he been sus-\npended as of today?\u201d could be understood to inquire as to whether \nthe student was previously suspended. \n3  See, e.g., SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022, Pub.

Hewitt, Corey \nDeyon Duffey, and Jarvis Dupree Dross jointly move for leave to dispense with the require-\nment of a joint appendix in this case. Both the government and the amicus curiae appointed \nto defend the judgment below agree that a joint appendix is not necessary. \nThis criminal case presents the question whether the sentencing reforms in section \n403(a) of the First Step Act of  2018 apply to defendants whose pre-enactment sentences \nhave been vacated and who must  be resentenced post-enactment. The appendices to the \npetitions for certiorari includes the opinion of the court of appeals and the relevant \nstatutory provisions. The parties do not believe that any other portion of the record merits \n\nthe kind of special attention that would warrant the preparation and expense of a joint \nappendix. Nor do they believe that a separate joint appendix would materially assist the \nCourt\u2019s consideration of the case. \nThe Solicitor General and the amicus curiae appointed to defend the judgment below \nagree with this motion.  \nDated: September 5, 2024 \nBy: /s/ Neal Kumar Katyal   \nNeal Kumar Katyal \nHogan Lovells US LLP \n555 Thirteenth Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 637-5600\nneal.katyal@hoganlovells.com\nCounsel for petitioners \nin No. 23-1150 \nBy: /s/ Michael B.

Huddleston & G. Pullum, The \nCambridge Grammar of the English \nLanguage (2002) ...................................... 10, 11, 13 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe brief of the Court-appointed amicus\u2014like the \nopinions of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2014ap-\nproaches the question presented like a logic puzzle. It \nidentifies various dictionary definitions and obscure rules \nof grammar and addresses them one after the other, as \nthough each were a predefined step in some inflexible \nscript for interpreting statutes. It takes this approach \nwithout a single thought for the backdrop that gives the \ntext its full meaning\u2014the linguistic context, legal back-\nground, and legislative purpose\u2014twisting the law\u2019s \nwords to accomplish the precise opposite of what every-\none acknowledges was Congress\u2019s objective. \nThat is not textualism, but literalism. It is not how \nordinary English speakers approach language or how \ncourts are supposed to approach statutory construction. \nAs Justice Scalia famously put it, a \u201cgood textualist is not \na literalist.\u201d A Matter of Interpretation 24 (1997). \nTextualism is a commitment to the idea that \u201cthe best \nevidence of Congress\u2019s intent is the statutory text\u201d (NFIB \nv. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544 (2012)) read through the \neyes of \u201can ordinary speaker of English\u201d (Comcast Corp. \nv. NAAAOM, 589 U.S. 327, 333 (2020))\u2014or at least an \n\u201cordinary lawyer\u201d (A. Barrett, Congressional Insiders and \nOutsiders, 84 U. Chi. L. Rev. 2193, 2209-2210 (2017)). \nIt does not ask whether \u201cetymologically it is possible\u201d to \nread a statute in a particular way through the eyes of an \nexpert grammarian dissecting sentence structures and \nverb tenses; it asks only what the statute means in \n\u201ceveryday speech\u201d given the background, context, pur-\npose, and \u201cphraseology of the statute.\u201d McBoyle v. United \nStates, 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  \nThese distinctions are essential. Too easily can a \nstatute be \u201ceviscerated by [a] wooden and literal read-\ning\u201d proffered by a \u201cbalky\u201d judge aiming to thwart \u201ca \nlegislature which ha[s] only words\u201d to work with. \n\n2 \n \nK. Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision \nand the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be \nConstrued, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 400 (1950). That pos-\nsibility is on clear display here: The lower courts aligned \nwith amicus each expressly eschewed consideration of \nbackground legal principles and the statute\u2019s acknow-\nledged aims. They fixated instead on a hyper-technical \nreading that sliced and diced the statute\u2019s text in ways \nthat no ordinary English speaker would (and that in any \nevent are wrong), in the end frustrating Congress\u2019s pur-\npose rather than effectuating it.  \nAmicus repeats their errors, characterizing anything \nother than grammar rules and dictionary definitions as \n\u201catextual\u201d or \u201cextratextual\u201d considerations, beyond the \nCourt\u2019s ken. His brief thus avoids rather than addresses \nthe context, background, and purpose of section 403(b). \nBut the Court cannot blinder itself to these factors. \n\u201c[T]extualism isn\u2019t a mechanical exercise, but rather one \ninvolving a sophisticated understanding of language as \nit\u2019s actually used in context.\u201d A. Barrett, Assorted \nCanards of Contemporary Legal Analysis: Redux, 70 Case \nW. Res. L. Rev. 855, 859 (2020).  \nAll three opening briefs offer an interpretation of sec-\ntion 403(b) that comports not only with relevant diction-\nary definitions and rules of grammar, but also with the \nlong-settled legal principles against which Congress \nacted, the full statutory context of the First Step Act, and \nthe undisputed purpose of the statute. They accordingly \noffer an answer to the question presented based not just \non what is etymologically possible, but on the way in \nwhich an ordinary English speaker would approach the \nissue. The Court must do the same\u2014and it must therefore \nreverse the court of appeals. \n \n\n3 \n \nA. A \u201csentence\u201d under Section 403(b) does not \ninclude a vacated sentence \nAt its core, the question presented here is whether \nCongress intended \u201ca sentence\u201d within the meaning of \nsection 403(b) to include a sentence that has been va-\ncated. As we showed in our opening brief (at 17-24), the \nanswer is no. Amicus\u2019s first rejoinder, that background \nlegal principles cannot override statutory text (Br. 29-31), \nmisses the point. His second rejoinder, that there is no \nbackground principle that treats vacated sentences as \nvoid ab initio (Br. 31-39), is simply wrong. \n1. Textualism requires considering background \nlegal principles \na. It is fundamental that \u201clanguage has meaning only \nin context.\u201d Graham County Soil & Water Conservation \nDistrict v. U.S. ex rel. Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 289 (2010). \n\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase [thus] depends upon\u201d \nnot just dictionaries and grammar guides, but \u201cthe whole \nstatutory text, considering the purpose and context of the \nstatute.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U.S. 481, 486 \n(2006). Accord A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 56 (2012) (explaining that \n\u201cwords are given meaning by their context\u201d) (hereinafter \nReading Law). \nContext is a broad concept, embracing not just the \n\u201clinguistic context\u201d of the words themselves, but also \n\u201chistorical and governmental contexts.\u201d Biden v. Ne-\nbraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2378 (2023) (Barrett, J., concur-\nring) (quoting F. Easterbrook, The Case of the Speluncean \nExplorers: Revisited, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 1876, 1913 \n(1999)). \u201cBackground legal conventions, for instance, are \npart of the statute\u2019s context.\u201d Ibid. \u201cEven the strictest \nmodern textualists\u201d recognize \u201cthat the literal or diction-\nary definitions of words will often fail to account for set-\ntled nuances or background conventions that qualify the \n\n4 \n \nliteral meaning of language and, in particular, of legal lan-\nguage.\u201d J. Manning, The Absurdity Doctrine, 116 Harv. L. \nRev. 2387, 2392-2393 (2003).1  \nThis is all simply to say that \u201c[t]he notion that some \nthings \u2018go without saying\u2019 applies to legislation just as it \ndoes to everyday life.\u201d Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2378 (Barrett, \nJ., concurring) (quoting Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. \n844, 857 (2014)). Due attention to the \u201cunexpressed pre-\nsumptions\u201d that Congress is understood to incorporate \ninto its enactments is therefore \u201c[p]art of a fair reading of \nstatutory text\u201d itself. Bond, 572 U.S. at 857.  \nIt follows that, to determine what Congress meant by \n\u201csentence\u201d\u2014a legal term peculiar to criminal proceed-\nings\u2014the Court must consider the background legal prin-\nciples and conventions that give the word its meaning. \nAnd as we address further below, one of those settled con-\nventions is that a vacated sentence is no sentence at all; it \nis a legal nullity ab initio. \nb. Amicus asserts (at 29) that the backdrop of legal \nconventions against which Congress acts is an \u201catextual \nconsideration.\u201d As he sees it (ibid.), we have turned to the \ndoctrine of vacatur to \u201covercome\u201d the text rather than to \ninform its interpretation. That is incorrect, and the cases \nthat he cites do not suggest otherwise. \n \n1  To be sure, a presumption that Congress intends its enactments to \nincorporate background legal principles may suggest that courts \n\u201cshould interpret statutes through the eyes of an ordinary lawyer ra-\nther than an ordinary person.\u201d Barrett, Insiders and Outsiders, supra \nat 2210. This merely \u201cemploy[s] the perspective of the intermediaries \non whom ordinary people rely\u201d and is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with textu-\nalism. Id. at 2209-2210. Accord J. Manning, What Divides Textual-\nists from Purposivists?, 106 Colum. L. Rev. 70, 81 (2006) (\u201c[W]ithin \nthe realm of legal parlance, * * * textualism\u2019s premise requires that \ninterpreters consider specialized conventions and linguistic practices \npeculiar to the law.\u201d). \n\n5 \n \nIn Corner Post v. Federal Reserve, the Court held that \ninterpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) was not controlled \nby \u201ccongressional intent divined from other statutes with \nvery different language.\u201d 603 U.S. 799, 815 (2024). We \nhave not made that kind of argument. As to the argument \nthat we have made, Corner Post lends strong support. The \nCourt there explained that the word \u201c\u2018accrue\u2019 had a well-\nsettled meaning\u201d according to a background principle \nthat a claim must come into existence before a limitations \nperiod begins to run. Id. at 810. \u201cThis traditional rule,\u201d \nthe Court went on, \u201cconstitutes a strong background pre-\nsumption\u201d against which Congress acted. Id. at 811. Be-\ncause \u201cCongress has [not] told us otherwise,\u201d that back-\nground rule dictated the meaning of the operative word. \nIbid. Just so here. \nMOAC Mall Holdings v. Transform Holdco sheds no \nmeaningful light on the issue here because it involved the \nquestion whether 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m) is a jurisdictional \nprovision. The Court has held repeatedly that to treat a \nprecondition to relief as a jurisdictional rule requires a \nclear statement. 598 U.S. 288, 298 (2023). Because a de-\nfault background principle works tacitly, it cannot, by it-\nself, \u201cindicat[e] a clear statement of jurisdictional in-\ntent.\u201d Id. at 302.  \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Honeycutt v. United States \nalso is inapposite. Unlike here, Congress there gave ex-\npress textual indications that it \u201cdid not [intend to] incor-\nporate [the cited] background principles.\u201d 581 U.S. 443, \n453 (2017). There is no express disavowal here. \nFinally, Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics con-\nfirmed that courts should \u201cinfer Congress\u2019 intent to incor-\nporate a background principle into a new statute where \nthe principle has previously been applied in a similar man-\nner.\u201d 571 U.S. 161, 175 (2014). The Court there declined \nto apply that rule only because the respondents urged an \n\n6 \n \noutcome that was \u201cquite different\u201d from the background \nprinciple they invoked. Ibid. No so here. \nc. Amicus asserts (at 39-41) that any \u201cbackground \nprinciple that vacatur prohibits courts from looking at the \nhistorical fact of a sentence\u2019s imposition\u201d is overridden \nby the \u201ccountervailing background principle\u201d codified by \nthe Federal Saving Statute. Not so. \nThe Federal Saving Statute specifies that repeals of \ncriminal laws do not apply retroactively to pre-enactment \nconduct \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so expressly pro-\nvide.\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. Here, section 403(b) does expressly \nso provide, and the question is the meaning and scope of \nthat provision. That is not an issue on which the Saving \nStatute sheds light.  \nIn contending otherwise, amicus appears to take the \nposition that, in addition to establishing a default rule \nagainst retroactive application of repeals, the Federal \nSaving Statute also creates a rule of statutory construc-\ntion requiring express provisions calling for retroactive \napplication to be construed narrowly. That is not what the \nstatute says; in fact, the Court said in Dorsey v. United \nStates that the Saving Statute does not bar retroactive ap-\nplication if the repeal statute \u201ceither expressly says or at \nleast by fair implication implies the contrary.\u201d 567 U.S. \n260, 273 (2012) (emphasis added). Thus, a fair implica-\ntion is all that is needed to displace the Saving Statute\u2019s \ndefault rule. Here, there is that and more. \n2. Vacatur wipes the slate clean, as though the \nsentence never existed \nAmicus asserts (at 31-33) that there is no settled \nbackground principle that vacatur renders a sentence void \nfrom the start. He is wrong. \na. As we showed in our opening brief (at 18-20 & n.2) \nthe law has been settled since before the Founding that a \nvacated order is ordinarily treated as though it was never \n\n7 \n \nentered in the first place. As the Court has said, \u201cvacating \nthe former judgment * * * render[s] it null and void, and \nthe parties are left in the same situation as if no trial had \never taken place in the cause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 \nU.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 (1869). \nAlong with the judgment itself, the law treats the pro-\nceeding that produced the judgment as though it never \nhappened. This general rule is why (for example) a new \ntrial following a vacated conviction does not violate dou-\nble jeopardy\u2014the vacatur \u201ceffectively erases from his-\ntory the fact of the jury\u2019s empanelment in the original \ntrial\u201d (Hewitt Br. 20), for \u201cthe original conviction has, at \nthe defendant\u2019s behest, been wholly nullified and the \nslate wiped clean.\u201d North Carolina v. Pearce, 325 U.S. \n711, 721 (1969) (citing United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. \n662 (1896)). This Court has made clear the same is true \nof sentencing proceedings. When an appellate court \n\u201cset[s] aside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and re-\nmand[s] for a de novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from \nthe original sentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffec-\ntively wip[ing] the slate clean.\u201d Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476, 507 (2011). \nAmicus dismisses (at 39) Pepper\u2019s clean slate lan-\nguage as a mere \u201cfigure of speech.\u201d Figure of speech or \nnot, it is the holding of the Court. The defendant in Pepper \nargued that the trial judge\u2019s initial decision to grant a \ndownward departure was \u201claw of the case\u201d despite that \nhis sentence had been vacated on unrelated grounds. 562 \nU.S. at 507. The Court rejected that argument because the \nvacatur order \u201cwiped the slate clean,\u201d erasing the prior \nrulings from the historical record. Ibid. \nb. According to amicus (at 31), criminal sentencings \nare exempt from this time-tested understanding of a vaca-\ntur\u2019s effect. Rather than treating a vacated sentence as \nthough it was never imposed, he insists, \u201cCongress has in \nfact required the opposite\u201d in the Sentencing Reform Act. \n\n8 \n \nWe explained in our opening brief (at 23-24) why the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act\u2014which instructs district courts to \napply the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cthat were in effect on \nthe date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior \nto the appeal\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1))\u2014is irrelevant \nhere. Amicus talks past this point without response. \nBeyond that, amicus asserts (at 32) that Congress \nshowed in sections 921(a)(20) that when it means to limit \nthe effect of vacated judgments, it says so expressly. But \nsection 921(a)(20)\u2014which specifies what \u201cconstitutes a \nconviction\u201d for certain violent felonies\u2014does not use the \nwords \u201cvacate\u201d or \u201cvacatur.\u201d It instead carves out con-\nvictions that have been \u201cexpunged\u201d or \u201cset aside,\u201d or \n\u201cfor which a person has been pardoned or has had civil \nrights restored.\u201d Those carveouts are more inclusive than \njudicial vacatur and thus require enumeration.  \nMoreover, Congress elected with section 921 to pro-\nvide an express definition of \u201cconviction\u201d that incorpo-\nrates state law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B). It thus makes \nsense that Congress would take care to specify express \nfederal exceptions to possibly conflicting state-law doc-\ntrine. Here, Congress did not provide a general, state-law \ndefinition of \u201ca sentence\u201d from which enumerated federal \nexceptions were required.  \nc. Amicus lists (at 33) several examples supposedly \nwhere \u201c[t]he historical fact of a vacated order * * * re-\nmains legally relevant to the application of a statute.\u201d \nThose examples do not hold up. \nAmicus cites (at 33-35) two statutes under which a \nprior conviction is an element of the offense. But the ques-\ntion whether convictions under felon-in-possession and \nfailure-to-register laws must be vacated when the defend-\nant\u2019s predicate conviction is vacated is an open one in this \nCourt, so it\u2019s hard to see what relevance those provisions \nhave. We note, however, that a defendant who received an \n\n9 \n \nenhanced sentence under the ACCA may petition to have \nthe sentence corrected if a predicate conviction is later va-\ncated. See Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295, 303-\n304 (2005). The rationale for this rule is \u201cnot controver-\nsial\u201d: \u201cWhen a state court \u2018vacates\u2019 a prior conviction, it, \nin effect, nullifies that conviction; it is as if that convic-\ntion no longer exists.\u201d United States v. Sanders, 909 F.3d \n895, 902 (7th Cir. 2018). \nThe same goes for amicus\u2019s reference (at 35) to the \nimmigration laws. True, some courts have held that a con-\nviction vacated \u201cbecause the defendant had rehabilitated \nhimself or suffered some hardship\u201d may still be consid-\nered under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act. United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th \n382, 393 (3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring). But the \nopinion of the Board of Immigration Appeals on that point \nhistorically has been granted Chevron deference, so the \nquestion whether it is correct has not been explored inde-\npendently by the lower courts or resolved by this Court. \nAnd even under IIRIRA, \u201cif a conviction is legally defec-\ntive\u201d on its merits, \u201cit is void from the start\u201d and \u201cno \nlonger counts as a conviction for immigration purposes.\u201d \nMitchell, 38 F.4th at 393 (Bibas, J., concurring). \nAmicus\u2019s citation to fraud (at 35) is also unhelpful. \nWhen someone lies about a past conviction, the statement \nis not made retroactively truthful by a later vacatur. What \nmakes a lie untruthful are the facts at the time of the \nspeaking. And an offense is committed when it is com-\npleted. Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970). \nFinally, amicus points (at 33-34) to Bravo-Fernandez \nv. United States, but that case supports our position. The \nCourt there confirmed that courts cannot \u201cgive[] effect to \n[a] vacated judgment,\u201d which is why retrial following va-\ncatur does not \u201coffend[] double jeopardy principles.\u201d 580 \nU.S. 5, 18 (2016). At the same time, this Court has said \nthat when a verdict is vacated for lack of sufficient \n\n10 \n \nevidence, retrial is not permissible because an appellate \ndetermination that \u201cthe evidence [was] insufficient to \nconvict is equivalent to an acquittal.\u201d Id. at 20. That gen-\neral rule does not give the original verdict continuing ef-\nfect; on the contrary, it calls for entry of a new judgment \nof dismissal because the government lacks sufficient evi-\ndence to sustain a retrial. Ibid. The question in Bravo-Fer-\nnandez was only whether the petitioners there were enti-\ntled to such relief. The Court\u2019s answer (no) does not call \ninto question the general rule that a vacatur eliminates \nthe legal effect ab initio of a prior judgment. \nIn all events, these strained examples are at most \nnarrow exceptions that prove the rule. A background legal \nprinciple does not have to be perfectly exceptionless for \nthe text of a statute presumptively to incorporate it. \nB. The surrounding text confirms our reading  \nThe text surrounding \u201csentence\u201d confirms our inter-\npretation. When amicus asserts (at 2) that we \u201cseek to re-\nwrite\u201d the text \u201cin multiple ways,\u201d he has it backward.  \n1. Congress\u2019s uses of the present-perfect tense \nand \u201cas of\u201d indicate an ongoing condition \na. We explained in the opening brief (at 25-28) that \nCongress\u2019s decision in section 403(b) to use the present-\nperfect tense (\u201chas not been\u201d) indicates that it was con-\ncerned with the imposition of a sentencing \u201cbeginning in \nthe past and extending up to now.\u201d R.

HEWITT, PETITIONER \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nNo. 23-1150 \nCOREY DEYON DUFFEY AND JARVIS DUPREE ROSS, \nPETITIONERS \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR RESPONDENT \nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS \n \nAs the government explained in its opening brief, \nSection 403(b) of the First Step Act\u2014which \u201cappl[ies]\u201d \nSection 403\u2019s ameliorated sentencing scheme \u201cif a sen-\ntence for the offense has not been imposed as of [the \nAct\u2019s] date of enactment,\u201d \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5222\u2014 \ncovers an offender who no longer has a sentence im-\nposed for that offense.  An offender whose pre-Act sen-\ntence has been vacated\u2014and thus needs a sentence to \nbe \u201cimpose[d]\u201d under 18 U.S.C. 3553\u2014is not an offender \non whom \u201ca sentence * * * has * * * been imposed\u201d un-\nder Section 403(b). \n\n2 \n \nAmicus cannot dispute that his alternative reading \nwould require district courts to sentence such offenders \nto decades of imprisonment under a scheme that the \nsame Congress discarded as overly harsh, while provid-\ning no offsetting benefit in protecting the finality of \ncriminal judgments.  He nonetheless insists (Br. 15-29) \nthat the text cannot be read any other way.  In making \nthat assertion, he reads Congress\u2019s choice of the  \npresent-perfect tense\u2014which focuses on continuation\u2014\nout of the statute.  If Congress had wanted amicus\u2019s ver-\nsion of the statute, it would have used the past-perfect \ntense\u2014but there is no foothold in the statute  to turn \n\u201chas\u201d into \u201chad.\u201d \nAmicus\u2019s effort to find support in the wording of \nother statutes disregards the most pertinent one, 18 \nU.S.C. 3582(c), which is worded similarly and plainly fo-\ncuses on continuing validity.  Amicus\u2019s arguments about \nhow Congress could have written Section 403(b) more \nclearly cut just as strongly against his proposed inter-\npretation and disregard the import of what Congress \ndid write.  And contrary to amicus\u2019s alternative argu-\nment, Section 403(b)\u2019s \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause does not require a \ncourt to completely ignore everything that happened af-\nter the Act\u2019s enactment.   \nNor can amicus identify any sound reason why Con-\ngress, in enacting such a major sentencing reform, \nwould have chosen to exclude pre-Act offenders who \nneed fresh sentences from the Act\u2019s reformations.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 and the government\u2019s understanding of Sec-\ntion 403(b) honors both the particular words that Con-\ngress chose and the evident purpose of the provision it \ncrafted.  Amicus\u2019s reading does neither.  This Court \nshould reject it and reverse the judgments below. \n\n3 \n \nA. Amicus Fails To Show That Validity Is Irrelevant Under \nSection 403(b) \nAs the government has explained, whether \u201ca sen-\ntence for the offense has  * * *  been imposed\u201d under \nSection 403(b) turns on the continuing existence of a \nvalid sentencing judgment.  U.S. Br. 16-20.  Congress\u2019s \nuse of the present-perfect tense indicates that the sen-\ntence at issue is one that remains valid in the present\u2014\ni.e., at the time of the sentencing proceeding to which \nSection 403(b) is relevant.  Id. at 17-19.  Congress\u2019s ref-\nerence to \u201ca sentence,\u201d rather than \u201cany sentence,\u201d \nwhen describing the triggering condition underscores \nthat interpretation.  Id. at 19-20.  Amicus does not show \notherwise. \n1. Amicus\u2019s textual arguments cannot overcome Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the present-perfect tense \nAt bottom, amicus\u2019s reading of the text transforms \n\u201chas\u201d into \u201chad.\u201d  That revision of the present-perfect \ntense into the past-perfect tense is impermissible.  As \n\u201cthe Dictionary Act instructs,\u201d \u201cthe present tense gen-\nerally does not include the past.\u201d  Carr v. United States, \n560 U.S. 438, 448 (2010). \na. Amicus observes that an ordinary speaker could \nuse the word \u201cimposed\u201d to refer to the historical fact \nthat a sentence was pronounced.  See, e.g., North Caro-\nlina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 713-714 (1969) (discussing \na sentence \u201coriginally imposed\u201d and describing a hold-\ning that \u201cthe longer sentence imposed upon retrial was \nunconstitutional and void\u201d) (citation and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  But an ordinary speaker could \nalso use \u201cimposed\u201d to refer to a legally operative sen-\ntence.  For example, if a prison official asks \u201cIs a death \nsentence imposed on Jones?\u201d, when Jones had once \n\n4 \n \nbeen sentenced to death but received a life sentence af-\nter a retrial, the correct answer would be \u201cNo.\u201d   \nThat is the sense in which \u201cimposed\u201d is used in Sec-\ntion 403(b), which differs markedly in form from the ex-\namples on which amicus relies.  Amicus\u2019s examples all \nuse the participle \u201cimposed\u201d as an adjective.  See Ami-\ncus Br. 21-22, 30-31 (\u201cthe death sentences imposed for \narmed robbery, however, were vacated\u201d; \u201cthe sentence \noriginally imposed on those particular counts\u201d; \u201cre-\nceive a longer sentence than the one originally im-\nposed\u201d) (emphases altered; brackets and citations omit-\nted).  Section 403(b), however, uses \u201cimposed\u201d as a verb:  \n\u201chas  * * *  been imposed.\u201d  And the verb tense Congress \nused\u2014the present-perfect\u2014clarifies that the provision \nrefers to a legally operative sentence.  See U.S. Br. 16-\n17, 20-22.  Section 403(b) therefore does not encompass \nsentences that have been vacated. \nTo take one of amicus\u2019s own examples, see Amicus \nBr. 21, saying \u201c[t]he death sentences [that were] im-\nposed for armed robbery  * * *  were vacated\u201d comports \nwith ordinary speech; saying \u201cthe death sentences [that \nare] imposed for armed robbery  * * * were vacated\u201d \ndoes not.  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 161-162 \n(1976).  Or, even more pertinently, saying \u201c[t]he death \nsentence[] [that had been] imposed for armed robbery  \n* * *  w[as] vacated\u201d comports with ordinary speech; \nsaying \u201cthe death sentence[] [that has been] imposed for \narmed robbery  * * *  w[as] vacated\u201d does not.  Ibid.1   \n \n1  Amicus\u2019s citation (Br. 22) of 18 U.S.C. 3742(f)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \n2255(a), which provide for relief in certain circumstances if \u201cthe sen-\ntence was imposed in violation\u201d of the law, cut against his reading.  \nIn both cases, the phrase refers to a sentence that remains in force \nat the relevant time.  See 18 U.S.C. 3742 (discussing relief following \n \n\n5 \n \nb. Amicus is wrong to suggest (Br. 24-27) that the \npresent-perfect tense supports his own reading.  Ami-\ncus cites Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage for the prop-\nosition that the present-perfect tense \u201csometimes rep-\nresents an action as having been completed at some in-\ndefinite time in the past.\u201d  Amicus Br. 25 (citing Bryan \nA. Garner, Garner\u2019s Modern English Usage 1082 (5th \ned. 2022) (Garner)).  But on the very same page that \namicus cites, Garner explains that it would be \u201cerror\u201d to \nuse the present-perfect tense where \u201cthe action is \nwholly in the past\u2014and the time is relatively definite.\u201d  \nGarner 1082 (emphasis added).  That is the very error \nthat amicus makes when he reads Section 403(b) to  \nrefer\u2014using the present-perfect tense\u2014to sentences \nthat are no longer valid because the imposition of a sen-\ntence \u201coccurs at a fixed point in time.\u201d  Amicus Br. 25 \n(emphasis added; citation omitted). \nRelatedly, amicus\u2019s interpretation violates the prin-\nciple that the present-perfect tense \u201cis not used in con-\ntexts where the \u2018now\u2019 component of\u200a\u201d a time period \u201cis \nexplicitly or implicitly excluded.\u201d  Rodney Huddleston \n& Geoffrey K. Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the \nEnglish Language 143 (2002).  An ordinary English \nspeaker might say that \u201cAlice had visited the park doz-\nens of times before its closure last year.\u201d  But the \nspeaker could not equivalently substitute the statement \n \n\u201creview of an otherwise final sentence\u201d under subsection (a) or (b) \nof the statute); 28 U.S.C. 2255(a) (allowing a claim by \u201c[a] prisoner  \n* * *  under sentence of a court  * * *  claiming  * * *  that the \nsentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States\u201d) (emphasis added).  A legal flaw in a previously in-\nvalidated sentence would obviously provide no basis for relief under \neither statute. \n\n6 \n \nthat \u201cAlice has visited that park dozens of times,\u201d be-\ncause that statement implies that the park remains \nopen to visitors.  And that latter statement is analogous \nto the phrasing that Congress employed in Section \n403(b)\u2014just replacing open parks with operative sen-\ntences. \nc. Amicus contends that if Congress intended to ex-\nclude only defendants whose sentences remained valid, \nit might have spoken more clearly, for instance by re-\nferring to \u201ca valid sentence,\u201d \u201cthe sentence,\u201d or (some-\nwhat more verbosely) \u201ca sentence that continues to le-\ngally bind the defendant.\u201d  Amicus Br. 17 (citation and \nemphases omitted).  But Congress had various reasons \nto eschew each of amicus\u2019s proposed reformulations.  A \nreference to \u201cthe sentence,\u201d for example, might have \nbeen interpreted to capture only cases that had reached \na final disposition, allowing any defendant with a pend-\ning appeal to reopen his validly imposed sentence.  See \nU.S. Br. 25 & n.3.  And a reference to \u201ca valid sentence\u201d \ncould have raised questions about the degree to which \nSection 403(b) allowed collateral attacks on sentences \nthat were already final. \nAmicus\u2019s reliance (Br. 32) on 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), \nwhich he identifies as a model for an express carveout \nof \u201cvacated sentences or convictions,\u201d actually under-\nmines his argument.  Section 921(a)(20) defines a rele-\nvant \u201cconviction\u201d for certain firearms laws to exclude \n\u201c[a]ny conviction which,\u201d among other things, \u201chas been \nexpunged[] or set aside.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20).  The  \npresent-perfect tense there obviously refers to an ex-\npungement with continuing validity:  a defendant with a \ncurrently valid conviction cannot, for example, lawfully \npossess a firearm simply because the conviction was \nonce erroneously expunged but later reinstated.  See 18 \n\n7 \n \nU.S.C. 922(g); cf. Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, \n64 (1980). \nIn any event, amicus himself ultimately acknowl-\nedges that the possibility that \u201cCongress could have ex-\npressed itself more clearly\u201d is not a reason to depart \nfrom the best interpretation of the statute that it did \nenact.  Amicus Br. 18 (quoting Luna Torres v. Lynch, \n578 U.S. 452, 472-473 (2016)).  And any potential basis \nfor faulting Congress for not choosing some purport-\nedly clearer alternative disappears entirely where, as \nhere, Congress could have been clearer in either direc-\ntion.  See U.S. Br. 31; Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. \n124, 138 (2024).  A Congress that wanted amicus\u2019s ap-\nproach could have referred to an \u201cinitial sentence\u201d or \nother clearer alternative, see U.S. Br. 31\u2014or could have \nsimply worded the provision to apply to a defendant who \n\u201chad never been sentenced.\u201d \n2. Amicus\u2019s reading does not accord with statutory con-\ntext \nAs the government has explained, the broader stat-\nutory context further supports the ordinary inference \nthat follows from Section 403(b)\u2019s use of the present-\nperfect tense.  See U.S. Br. 22-23.  Amicus fails even to \nrespond to the government\u2019s observations about the \nmost analogous provision, and his attempt to draw sup-\nport from unrelated statutes is misplaced. \na. The most informative piece of the contextual \nbackdrop is Congress\u2019s use of the same language that \nappears in Section 403(b)\u2014\u201chas * * * been imposed\u201d\u2014\nin the closely related context of 18 U.S.C. 3582(c).  See \nU.S. Br. 22-23.  Section 3582 provides that, except in \ncertain delimited circumstances, \u201c[t]he court may not \nmodify a term of imprisonment once it has been im-\n\n8 \n \nposed.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3582(c); see U.S. Br. 22-23.  That lan-\nguage unequivocally refers to sentences that remain \nvalid; a court is free to deviate from a previously im-\nposed sentence that was vacated, notwithstanding that, \nas a matter of historical fact, it was at one point im-\nposed.  See Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 507 \n(2011). \nAmicus does not acknowledge Section 3582(c) at all.  \nThat omission is glaring because the critical language \nof Section 403(b) mirrors the language of Section \n3582(c).  Section 403(b) applies when \u201ca sentence for the \noffense has not been imposed,\u201d \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5222 \n(emphasis added); Section 3582(c) applies to \u201ca term of \nimprisonment once it has been imposed,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n3582(c) (emphasis added).  The \u201chas  * * *  been im-\nposed\u201d language is thus most naturally understood the \nsame way in both places.  Amicus\u2019s failure to reconcile \nCongress\u2019s use of \u201chas  * * *  been imposed\u201d in Section \n403(b) with its use of the same language in Section \n3582(c) makes his historical-fact reading particularly in-\ncongruous. \nb. Though he does not address Section 3582(c), ami-\ncus points to other statutes, involving confirmation of \nbankruptcy plans and other nonsentencing matters, \nthat use the present-perfect tense.  See Amicus Br. 27 \n& nn.4-5.  But amicus has not identified any instances \nwhere a court has read any of those provisions in the \nmanner he urges here, i.e., to apply to an event that hap-\npened in the past but no longer holds force, such as a \nreopened bankruptcy plan. \nNor can amicus dispute that still other statutes use \nthe past-perfect tense to convey the type of meaning \nthat he would attribute to Section 403(b)\u2019s use of the \npresent-perfect tense.  See U.S. Br. 18.  Thus, even his \n\n9 \n \nefforts to survey the entirety of the U.S. Code do not \nmove the needle in his direction.  The provisions he in-\nvokes instead simply confirm that Congress had a \nchoice of tenses, and here used the present-perfect\u2014a \nchoice that signals continuing validity, rather than a \nblinkered focus on the past. \n3. No background rule resolves this case  \na. Amicus is correct that there is no general back-\nground rule that a vacated conviction or sentence is void \nab initio and so \u201cmust be disregarded for all purposes.\u201d  \nAmicus Br. 31 (capitalization omitted); see id. at 33-39; \nbut see Hewitt Br. 17-21; Duffey Br. 16-28.  Sometimes, \nthe historical fact of a conviction or sentence is itself \nrelevant.  See U.S. Br. 16, 26 & n.4.  Other times\u2014like \nhere\u2014it is important that a particular conviction or sen-\ntence remains operative.  See id. at 14-26; see pp. 3-9, \nsupra. \nThe issue is statute-specific, and no background rule \nsupports either petitioners\u2019 \u201cvoid ab initio\u201d position or \namicus\u2019s own \u201chistorical fact\u201d position, as illustrated by \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Lewis v. United States, on which \namicus himself relies (Br. 31-32).  Lewis addressed a \nprohibition on firearm possession by \u201c[a]ny person who  \n* * *  has been convicted  * * *  of a felony.\u201d  445 U.S. at \n56 n.1.  And the Court\u2019s consideration of invalid or va-\ncated convictions there cannot be squared with a one-\nsize-fits-all rule like the ones that amicus and petition-\ners propose. \nThe Court did not embrace a void ab initio approach, \ninstead making clear that a defendant generally would \nviolate the statute so long as he had a prior conviction \non the books when he possessed a firearm, even if that \nconviction turned out to be constitutionally infirm.  See \nLewis, 445 U.S. at 60-61.  At the same time, the Court \n\n10 \n \ndid not embrace a historical fact approach, indicating \nthat the statute permitted firearm possession if a de-\nfendant secured vacatur of a prior conviction \u201cbefore ob-\ntaining a firearm,\u201d even though the defendant had at \nsome point been convicted in the past.  Id. at 64; see id. \nat 61 n.5.  So too here, the Court should not presump-\ntively embrace either amicus\u2019s or petitioners\u2019 approach \nas a background rule. \nb. Amicus\u2019s effort (Br. 39-40) to invoke the back-\nground rule of the federal saving statute, 1 U.S.C. 109, \nis likewise misplaced.  Section 109 provides that the \npenalty scheme in effect at the time of the offense ap-\nplies unless the \u201c\u200a\u2018plain import\u2019 or \u2018fair implication,\u2019\u200a\u201d of \na new criminal statute is \u201cto apply its new penalties to a \nset of pre-Act offenders.\u201d  Dorsey v. United States, 567 \nU.S. 260, 275 (2012).  And even on amicus\u2019s own reading, \nSection 403(b) supplies the necessary \u201cfair implication.\u201d \nIf the saving statute\u2019s default rule applied, then even \nthe initial sentencings of defendants who committed \ntheir crimes before the First Step Act\u2019s enactment \nwould be subject to the harsher pre-Act penalties.  But \namicus does not urge that result; it is therefore common \nground that Section 403(b) supplants the default rule.  \nAnd amicus identifies (Br. 40) no authority for the prop-\nosition that where, as here, Congress has enacted a stat-\nute that clearly overrides the default rule, it must none-\ntheless rebut that rule\u2019s application to every possible \ncircumstance that might arise under that statute. \nB. Amicus\u2019s Additional Arguments Are Unsound \nAmicus\u2019s further arguments are either back-channel \nefforts to bolster his transformation of \u201chas\u201d into \u201chad,\u201d \nor attempts to minimize the implications of the present-\nperfect tense\u2019s focus on continuing validity.  Both sets \nof contentions lack merit.   \n\n11 \n \n1. Amicus\u2019s reliance on the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause is misplaced   \na. In trying to defuse Congress\u2019s choice of verb \ntense, amicus maintains that using the past-perfect \ntense would have \u201cma[de] no sense\u201d because Section \n403(b) asks if a sentence has been imposed \u201cas of such \ndate of enactment,\u201d which amicus reads to mean \u201c\u200a\u2018as of \ntoday,\u2019 when we (Congress) enact this law.\u201d  Amicus Br. \n25-26 (citation omitted).  He argues that a statute writ-\nten with the past-perfect tense, asking whether \u201ca sen-\ntence for the offense had not been imposed as of today,\u201d \nwould have been \u201ca syntactical hash\u201d if read on the pre-\ncise date of the statute\u2019s enactment.  Id. at 26 (brackets \nand citation omitted).  But amicus\u2019s premise\u2014that the \nprovision was written to be read only on the one specific \nday on which it was enacted\u2014disregards basic precepts \nof statutory drafting. \nStatutory provisions typically do not require the \nreader to travel back in time; instead, they are gener-\nally drafted to \u201cspeak[] as of whatever time [they are] \nbeing read (rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or \nput into effect).\u201d  The Office of the Legis. Counsel, U.S. \nHouse of Reps., House Legislative Counsel\u2019s Manual \non Drafting Style \u00a7 102(c), at 5 (Dec. 2022).  Section \n403(b) should therefore be presumed to have been writ-\nten from the perspective of the judges who would later \nread and apply it\u2014for whom it would no longer be De-\ncember 21, 2018.  And from the perspective of a judge \nabout to conduct a sentencing, the use of the past- \nperfect tense (\u201chad\u201d) would have been not only sensible \n\n12 \n \nbut preferable if Section 403(b) in fact had the meaning \nthat amicus ascribes to it.2 \nb. For similar reasons, amicus is wrong to suggest \n(Br. 2-3, 12-13, 20, 25-26, 29) that even if \u201ca sentence\u201d \nthat \u201chas * * * been imposed\u201d does indeed refer to a \nsentence with continuing validity, the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause lim-\nits the validity to a specific time period.  As amicus \nwould have it, the effect of the clause would be that the \nsentence\u2019s validity need only have continued until De-\ncember 21, 2018\u2014after which, for amicus, all bets are \noff.  That, however, is not the clause\u2019s function. \nInstead, the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause simply clarifies when Sec-\ntion 403(a) begins to apply:  namely, on the date of its \nenactment.  Whether or not that would have been pre-\nsumed in the absence of such a specification, Congress \nhas regularly included similar language in other stat-\nutes.3  The inclusion of such typical \u201cas of\u200a\u201d phrasing in \nSection 403(b) does not require a court conducting a re-\nsentencing to turn a blind eye to everything that hap-\npened after December 21, 2018\u2014including even the \nvery invalidation that precipitated the resentencing. \n \n2  In any event, there would be nothing unusual about asking \nwhether an event had occurred before today.  \u201cHad he been sus-\npended as of today?\u201d could be understood to inquire as to whether \nthe student was previously suspended. \n3  See, e.g., SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-328, Div. T, \nTit. III, \u00a7 301(c), 136 Stat. 5338 (\u201cThe amendments made by this \nsection shall apply as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\u201d); Co-\noperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act, Pub. \nL. No. 113-97, \u00a7 103(d), 128 Stat. 1120 (\u201cThe amendments made by \nthis section shall apply as of the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d).  Cf., \ne.g., Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, \u00a7 7079(b), \n102 Stat. 4406 (specifying that amendments to 18 U.S.C. 709 \u201cshall \ntake effect 90 days after the date of enactment of th[e] Act\u201d). \n\n13 \n \nAs just discussed, a statute is typically written from \nthe time perspective of the reader.  And that perspec-\ntive can change how past events are viewed.  For in-\nstance (and even using the past-perfect tense), it would \nbe perfectly ordinary to say in December, looking back \non the baseball season of a pitcher who peaked early, \nthat \u201cthe pitcher had played two of his three best games \nas of May 5.\u201d  That statement conveys that the relevant \ngames were played on May 5 or earlier, although their \nstatus\u2014numbering among the top three games of the \npitcher\u2019s season\u2014depends on subsequent events and \ncannot be ascertained until the season is complete.  \nEven more analogously to this case, suppose that a \nwealthy tycoon dying of a rare disease directs in his will \nthat a portion of his estate should be given to \u201cany indi-\nvidual who has been diagnosed with the disease as of the \ndate of my death.\u201d  Someone who was diagnosed with \nthe disease when the tycoon died, but learned before the \nwill was executed that the diagnosis was in error, could \nnot reasonably expect to claim funds nonetheless.  In-\nstead, the later invalidation of the diagnosis would take \nit outside the scope of the bequest.  A similar logic ap-\nplies here, with invalid sentences taking the place of in-\nvalid diagnoses.  \nTellingly, amicus\u2019s own primary argument is that the \nhistorical fact that a sentence was once imposed is dis-\npositive, regardless of its validity on the enactment \ndate.  See, e.g., Amicus Br. 24 (whether a sentence was \nimposed \u201cis an immutable historical fact\u201d).  Under that \nview, even a pre-enactment vacatur of the sentence is \nirrelevant.  And that view is incompatible with the ar-\ngument that the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause means that the touch-\nstone of Section 403(b) analysis is validity measured on \nDecember 21, 2018. \n\n14 \n \nc. At a minimum, amicus is mistaken in placing \nheavy emphasis on the \u201cas of\u200a\u201d clause.  When coupled \nwith a date, \u201cas of\u200a\u201d can bear opposite meanings.  It can \nrefer to the conditions that existed \u201c[a]s things stood\u201d \non a particular date.  Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. \nDec. 2024).  Conversely, it can refer to a period of time \nbeginning \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d a particular date.  In light \nof the inherent imprecisions of the prepositional phrase \n\u201cas of,\u201d Garner\u2019s English Usage warns that it \u201cshould \nbe used with caution,\u201d and is most appropriately used \nsimply to set \u201cthe effective date of a legal document,\u201d \nGarner 93, as it should be understood to do here. \n2. Section 403(b)\u2019s title does not bear on the question \npresented \nAmicus also attempts (Br. 26) to draw support from \nSection 403(b)\u2019s title, \u201capplicability to pending cases,\u201d \n403(b), 132 Stat. 5222 (capitalization omitted), suggest-\ning that petitioners\u2019 cases \u201cwere not \u2018pending\u2019 on the \ndate of [Section 403(b)\u2019s] enactment.\u201d  But the title does \nnot advance amicus\u2019s position. \nAs noted above, see p. 11, supra, statutes are gener-\nally written from the reader\u2019s, not the drafter\u2019s, per-\nspective.  And on a contemporaneous reading, cases like \npetitioners\u2019 are indisputably \u201cpending\u201d when awaiting \n\u201c[i]mposition of a sentence,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553. \nAmicus\u2019s argument also proves too much.  Even on \nhis reading, an offender who committed his offense be-\nfore the First Step Act was enacted, but was indicted \nand prosecuted only thereafter, is covered by Section \n403(b)\u2014even though the case was not \u201cpending\u201d on the \nenactment date.   \n\n15 \n \n3. Nothing in the legislative history indicates that Con-\ngress intended amicus\u2019s reading \nAmicus\u2019s similar argument (Br. 44) based on legisla-\ntive history likewise lacks merit.  In addition to drawing \nunfounded inferences, his invocation of history under-\ncuts his own position. \nAmicus notes (Br. 44) that shortly before the Act\u2019s \nenactment, Senator Cardin stated that the bill fell \nshort, in his view, because \u201c[s]everal sentencing provi-\nsions don\u2019t apply to individuals currently incarcerated.\u201d  \n164 Cong. Rec. S7775 (daily ed. Dec. 18, 2018).  But that \ndoes not suggest that petitioners are excluded from \nSection 403(b) simply because they were \u201ccurrently in-\ncarcerated\u201d when the First Step Act was passed.   \nIt is not clear that Senator Cardin was referring spe-\ncifically to Section 403(b).  Even assuming that he was, \nhe may simply have been noting that Section 403(b) \ndoes not allow for the reopening of sentences that are \notherwise final.  And even beyond that, amicus\u2019s reli-\nance on the statement proves too much:  after all, even \non his interpretation, Section 403(b) does apply to some \nthen-incarcerated individuals, like convicted defend-\nants awaiting an initial sentence.  See 18 U.S.C. \n3143(a)(1) (establishing general rule that \u201ca person who \nhas been found guilty of an offense and who is awaiting \nimposition or execution of a sentence * * * be de-\ntained\u201d). \n4. Amicus errs in suggesting that petitioners\u2019 vacated \nsentences are actually still valid \nFinally, amicus contends (Br. 1, 20) that there was \nno legal flaw in petitioners\u2019 sentences on the counts at \nissue here.  But while it is true that the sentences were \nnot invalid for any intrinsic reason, cf. Br. in Opp. at 10, \nJackson v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 1234 (2022) (No. 21-\n\n16 \n \n5875) (cert. denied Mar. 7, 2022), they no longer had \ncontinuing legal force at the time of petitioners\u2019 resen-\ntencing because they had been vacated.  Otherwise, \nthey would remain \u201cimposed,\u201d and the district court \ncould not \u201cimpose a sentence,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), to re-\nplace them. \nC. Amicus Cannot Reconcile His Reading With Section \n403\u2019s Design \nAmicus is also unable to explain how his interpreta-\ntion would further, rather than undermine, Section \n403\u2019s objectives.  As the government has explained, Sec-\ntion 403(b) is carefully crafted to strike a balance be-\ntween fairness and finality.  See U.S. Br. 23-26; see \nHewitt Br. 31-35.  Allowing defendants like petitioners, \nwho are already undergoing a plenary resentencing, to \nbe sentenced under the ameliorated scheme adopted in \nSection 403(a) imposes no finality cost.  Amicus\u2019s read-\ning, in contrast, would perpetuate a prior sentencing \nscheme that Congress deemed unfair, without any off-\nsetting finality benefit. \n1. Amicus first attempts to characterize reliance on \nthe Act\u2019s evident purpose as a \u201cpolicy\u201d argument that \nignores Section 403(b)\u2019s actual text.  Amicus Br. 45; see \nid. at 44-46.  But in construing statutory text, this Court \noften asks which interpretation \u201cbest fulfills [an Act\u2019s] \nstatutory objectives.\u201d  Brown v. United States, 602 U.S. \n101, 113 (2024); see Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, \nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 20 \n(2012) (explaining that an \u201cessential element of context \nthat gives meaning to words\u201d is the \u201cevident purpose of \nwhat a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  Considering the stat-\nute\u2019s purpose is appropriate here, where Congress\u2019s \nbalance between fairness and finality is apparent from \nthe text.   \n\n17 \n \nThere can be no serious question that, by extending \nthe application of the ameliorated sentencing scheme to \nsome but not all pre-Act offenders, Congress was strik-\ning a balance between fairness and the finality of exist-\ning convictions.  Unlike a neighboring provision of the \nFirst Step Act (Section 404), Section 403 does not allow \nfor revisitation of still-\u201cimpose[d],\u201d nonvacated, sen-\ntences.  \u00a7 404(b), 132 Stat. 5222; see Concepcion v. \nUnited States, 597 U.S. 481, 504 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting) (describing Section 404(b) as a limited ex-\nception to \u201c[t]he finality of criminal judgments\u201d).  But \nSection 403 also spares pre-Act offenders from sentenc-\ning under the harsher scheme that would apply by de-\nfault under the federal saving statute.  See p. 10, supra.  \nAnd Section 403 strikes that balance by using language \nthat mirrors Section 3582(c), the provision that sets out \nthe general rule of finality applicable in federal sentenc-\ning law.  See pp. 7-8, supra; U.S. Br. 22. \nAmicus\u2019s position would upset Section 403\u2019s balance \nby applying the discarded harsher penalties more often \nwithout any offsetting finality benefits.  Applying Sec-\ntion 403(a) to offenders like petitioners does not require \nreopening a final sentence\u2014it only reaches offenders \nwho do not have a legally operative sentence and re-\nquire resentencing in any event.   \n2. Amicus contends (Br. 46-47) that his reading \nmakes Section 403(b) more easily administrable and \nthat it is fairer to similarly situated defendants.  Nei-\nther argument is correct.   \nFirst, amicus claims that his rule is \u201cclear,\u201d asserting \nthat it \u201ccan be easily applied from the date of enactment \nonward\u201d because \u201cthe full universe of defendants who \nqualify under \u00a7 403(b) could be fully and easily ascer-\ntained.\u201d  Amicus Br. 26, 46.  That assertion is mistaken.  \n\n18 \n \nSection 403(b) unequivocally applies the ameliorated \nscheme to at least some offenders whose identity and \nnumber remained unknown on the Act\u2019s date of enact-\nment\u2014namely, pre-Act offenders who had not yet been \ncharged. \nMore fundamentally, the relevant question in as-\nsessing administrability is not how easily Congress \ncould enumerate the offenders affected by a particular \nprovision, but how easy the statute would be for a court \nto apply in a particular case.  And when a Section 924(c) \nsentence needs to be imposed at a sentencing proceed-\ning in a particular case, the easiest thing to do is just to \napply the First Step Act sentencing scheme, irrespec-\ntive of whether some previous sentence had been va-\ncated or when the vacatur occurred.  \nSecond, amicus suggests (Br. 46-47) that his ap-\nproach would be the fairest.  But \u201cdisparities, reflecting \na line-drawing effort, will exist whenever Congress en-\nacts a new law changing sentences (unless Congress in-\ntends re-opening sentencing proceedings concluded \nprior to a new law\u2019s effective date).\u201d  Dorsey, 567 U.S. \nat 280.  And, on anyone\u2019s reading, Congress accepted at \nleast some disparities.  For example, if two coconspira-\ntors\u2019 separate initial proceedings straddle the First \nStep Act\u2019s enactment date because one evaded arrest \nfor longer or delayed trial proceedings by repeatedly \nfiring his counsel, only the dilatory coconspirator would \nbe subject to the newer, lighter penalties.  Once Con-\ngress departed from a time-of-offense rule, the next \nmost relevant principle here is finality, and an offender \nwhose sentence is vacated, requiring a plenary resen-\ntencing, is differently situated in a critical way from an \noffender whose sentence remains valid and in effect. \n\n19 \n \nAmicus cannot explain away the disparities that \narise under his own reading.  See Duffey Br. 50-51.  \nAmicus accepts (Br. 47 n.8) that on his view, a district \ncourt would be required to impose the harsh pre-Act \nsentencing provisions on a defendant whose pre-Act \nSection 924(c) convictions are vacated, and who, after \nthe Act\u2019s enactment, is retried, convicted, and sen-\ntenced anew.  Amicus asserts that there is nothing odd \nabout requiring the imposition of the pre-Act stacking \nregime for such a newly convicted offender because that \noffender is treated the same as \u201cother offenders who \ncommitted the same crimes on the same dates.\u201d  Amicus \nBr. 47 n.8.  But that argument disregards Congress\u2019s \ncontrary judgment:  Congress expressly departed from \nthe default rule that the date of offense determines the \napplicable penalties.  \u00a7 403(b), 132 Stat. 5222.  Congress \nthus indicated that the proper rule is uniformity among \npost-Act impositions of sentences (all of which should be \nsubject to the new regime)\u2014not the (partial) uniformity \nthat amicus tries to create between pre-Act and post-\nAct offenders. \nD. Resort To The Rule Of Lenity Is Unwarranted \nPetitioners\u2019 invocation (Hewitt Br. 35-37; Duffey Br. \n42-44) of the rule of lenity is misplaced.  That rule ap-\nplies only to \u201cinterpretations of the substantive ambit of \ncriminal prohibitions, [and] to the penalties they im-\npose.\u201d  Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 \n(1980).  Section 403(b), however, is an act of legislative \ngrace that extends the application of a new sentencing \nscheme to offenders who committed their crimes under \nthe older regime\u2014thereby overriding the default rule \nin the saving statute.  The rule of lenity does not super-\ncharge a provision that is already an act of lenity.  Cf. \nFreeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.S. 624, 637 \n\n20 \n \n(2012) (per curiam) (\u201cNo legislation pursues its pur-\nposes at all costs.\u201d) (brackets and citation omitted). \nIn any event, the rule of lenity comes into play only \nif, after employing all of the traditional tools of statu-\ntory construction, \u201cthere remains a grievous ambiguity\u201d \nsuch that \u201cthe Court must simply guess as to what Con-\ngress intended.\u201d  United States v. Castleman, 572 U.S. \n157, 173 (2014) (citation omitted).  The possibility of \n\u201ctwo grammatically permissible readings of the statute \nwhen viewed in the abstract\u201d is not enough.  Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 152.  Petitioners\u2019 position is the correct one \nnot because of the rule of lenity, but because the text, \ncontext, and design of Section 403(b) show that Con-\ngress did not intend to subject petitioners to the \nharsher pre-Act punishment scheme. \n*   *   *   *   * \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Huddleston & G. Pullum, The \nCambridge Grammar of the English \nLanguage (2002) ...................................... 10, 11, 13 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe brief of the Court-appointed amicus\u2014like the \nopinions of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits\u2014ap-\nproaches the question presented like a logic puzzle. It \nidentifies various dictionary definitions and obscure rules \nof grammar and addresses them one after the other, as \nthough each were a predefined step in some inflexible \nscript for interpreting statutes. It takes this approach \nwithout a single thought for the backdrop that gives the \ntext its full meaning\u2014the linguistic context, legal back-\nground, and legislative purpose\u2014twisting the law\u2019s \nwords to accomplish the precise opposite of what every-\none acknowledges was Congress\u2019s objective. \nThat is not textualism, but literalism. It is not how \nordinary English speakers approach language or how \ncourts are supposed to approach statutory construction. \nAs Justice Scalia famously put it, a \u201cgood textualist is not \na literalist.\u201d A Matter of Interpretation 24 (1997). \nTextualism is a commitment to the idea that \u201cthe best \nevidence of Congress\u2019s intent is the statutory text\u201d (NFIB \nv. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544 (2012)) read through the \neyes of \u201can ordinary speaker of English\u201d (Comcast Corp. \nv. NAAAOM, 589 U.S. 327, 333 (2020))\u2014or at least an \n\u201cordinary lawyer\u201d (A. Barrett, Congressional Insiders and \nOutsiders, 84 U. Chi. L. Rev. 2193, 2209-2210 (2017)). \nIt does not ask whether \u201cetymologically it is possible\u201d to \nread a statute in a particular way through the eyes of an \nexpert grammarian dissecting sentence structures and \nverb tenses; it asks only what the statute means in \n\u201ceveryday speech\u201d given the background, context, pur-\npose, and \u201cphraseology of the statute.\u201d McBoyle v. United \nStates, 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  \nThese distinctions are essential. Too easily can a \nstatute be \u201ceviscerated by [a] wooden and literal read-\ning\u201d proffered by a \u201cbalky\u201d judge aiming to thwart \u201ca \nlegislature which ha[s] only words\u201d to work with. \n\n2 \n \nK. Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision \nand the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be \nConstrued, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 400 (1950). That pos-\nsibility is on clear display here: The lower courts aligned \nwith amicus each expressly eschewed consideration of \nbackground legal principles and the statute\u2019s acknow-\nledged aims. They fixated instead on a hyper-technical \nreading that sliced and diced the statute\u2019s text in ways \nthat no ordinary English speaker would (and that in any \nevent are wrong), in the end frustrating Congress\u2019s pur-\npose rather than effectuating it.  \nAmicus repeats their errors, characterizing anything \nother than grammar rules and dictionary definitions as \n\u201catextual\u201d or \u201cextratextual\u201d considerations, beyond the \nCourt\u2019s ken. His brief thus avoids rather than addresses \nthe context, background, and purpose of section 403(b). \nBut the Court cannot blinder itself to these factors. \n\u201c[T]extualism isn\u2019t a mechanical exercise, but rather one \ninvolving a sophisticated understanding of language as \nit\u2019s actually used in context.\u201d A. Barrett, Assorted \nCanards of Contemporary Legal Analysis: Redux, 70 Case \nW. Res. L. Rev. 855, 859 (2020).  \nAll three opening briefs offer an interpretation of sec-\ntion 403(b) that comports not only with relevant diction-\nary definitions and rules of grammar, but also with the \nlong-settled legal principles against which Congress \nacted, the full statutory context of the First Step Act, and \nthe undisputed purpose of the statute. They accordingly \noffer an answer to the question presented based not just \non what is etymologically possible, but on the way in \nwhich an ordinary English speaker would approach the \nissue. The Court must do the same\u2014and it must therefore \nreverse the court of appeals. \n \n\n3 \n \nA. A \u201csentence\u201d under Section 403(b) does not \ninclude a vacated sentence \nAt its core, the question presented here is whether \nCongress intended \u201ca sentence\u201d within the meaning of \nsection 403(b) to include a sentence that has been va-\ncated. As we showed in our opening brief (at 17-24), the \nanswer is no. Amicus\u2019s first rejoinder, that background \nlegal principles cannot override statutory text (Br. 29-31), \nmisses the point. His second rejoinder, that there is no \nbackground principle that treats vacated sentences as \nvoid ab initio (Br. 31-39), is simply wrong. \n1. Textualism requires considering background \nlegal principles \na. It is fundamental that \u201clanguage has meaning only \nin context.\u201d Graham County Soil & Water Conservation \nDistrict v. U.S. ex rel. Wilson, 559 U.S. 280, 289 (2010). \n\u201cInterpretation of a word or phrase [thus] depends upon\u201d \nnot just dictionaries and grammar guides, but \u201cthe whole \nstatutory text, considering the purpose and context of the \nstatute.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U.S. 481, 486 \n(2006). Accord A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 56 (2012) (explaining that \n\u201cwords are given meaning by their context\u201d) (hereinafter \nReading Law). \nContext is a broad concept, embracing not just the \n\u201clinguistic context\u201d of the words themselves, but also \n\u201chistorical and governmental contexts.\u201d Biden v. Ne-\nbraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2378 (2023) (Barrett, J., concur-\nring) (quoting F. Easterbrook, The Case of the Speluncean \nExplorers: Revisited, 112 Harv. L. Rev. 1876, 1913 \n(1999)). \u201cBackground legal conventions, for instance, are \npart of the statute\u2019s context.\u201d Ibid. \u201cEven the strictest \nmodern textualists\u201d recognize \u201cthat the literal or diction-\nary definitions of words will often fail to account for set-\ntled nuances or background conventions that qualify the \n\n4 \n \nliteral meaning of language and, in particular, of legal lan-\nguage.\u201d J. Manning, The Absurdity Doctrine, 116 Harv. L. \nRev. 2387, 2392-2393 (2003).1  \nThis is all simply to say that \u201c[t]he notion that some \nthings \u2018go without saying\u2019 applies to legislation just as it \ndoes to everyday life.\u201d Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2378 (Barrett, \nJ., concurring) (quoting Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. \n844, 857 (2014)). Due attention to the \u201cunexpressed pre-\nsumptions\u201d that Congress is understood to incorporate \ninto its enactments is therefore \u201c[p]art of a fair reading of \nstatutory text\u201d itself. Bond, 572 U.S. at 857.  \nIt follows that, to determine what Congress meant by \n\u201csentence\u201d\u2014a legal term peculiar to criminal proceed-\nings\u2014the Court must consider the background legal prin-\nciples and conventions that give the word its meaning. \nAnd as we address further below, one of those settled con-\nventions is that a vacated sentence is no sentence at all; it \nis a legal nullity ab initio. \nb. Amicus asserts (at 29) that the backdrop of legal \nconventions against which Congress acts is an \u201catextual \nconsideration.\u201d As he sees it (ibid.), we have turned to the \ndoctrine of vacatur to \u201covercome\u201d the text rather than to \ninform its interpretation. That is incorrect, and the cases \nthat he cites do not suggest otherwise. \n \n1  To be sure, a presumption that Congress intends its enactments to \nincorporate background legal principles may suggest that courts \n\u201cshould interpret statutes through the eyes of an ordinary lawyer ra-\nther than an ordinary person.\u201d Barrett, Insiders and Outsiders, supra \nat 2210. This merely \u201cemploy[s] the perspective of the intermediaries \non whom ordinary people rely\u201d and is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with textu-\nalism. Id. at 2209-2210. Accord J. Manning, What Divides Textual-\nists from Purposivists?, 106 Colum. L. Rev. 70, 81 (2006) (\u201c[W]ithin \nthe realm of legal parlance, * * * textualism\u2019s premise requires that \ninterpreters consider specialized conventions and linguistic practices \npeculiar to the law.\u201d). \n\n5 \n \nIn Corner Post v. Federal Reserve, the Court held that \ninterpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) was not controlled \nby \u201ccongressional intent divined from other statutes with \nvery different language.\u201d 603 U.S. 799, 815 (2024). We \nhave not made that kind of argument. As to the argument \nthat we have made, Corner Post lends strong support. The \nCourt there explained that the word \u201c\u2018accrue\u2019 had a well-\nsettled meaning\u201d according to a background principle \nthat a claim must come into existence before a limitations \nperiod begins to run. Id. at 810. \u201cThis traditional rule,\u201d \nthe Court went on, \u201cconstitutes a strong background pre-\nsumption\u201d against which Congress acted. Id. at 811. Be-\ncause \u201cCongress has [not] told us otherwise,\u201d that back-\nground rule dictated the meaning of the operative word. \nIbid. Just so here. \nMOAC Mall Holdings v. Transform Holdco sheds no \nmeaningful light on the issue here because it involved the \nquestion whether 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m) is a jurisdictional \nprovision. The Court has held repeatedly that to treat a \nprecondition to relief as a jurisdictional rule requires a \nclear statement. 598 U.S. 288, 298 (2023). Because a de-\nfault background principle works tacitly, it cannot, by it-\nself, \u201cindicat[e] a clear statement of jurisdictional in-\ntent.\u201d Id. at 302.  \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Honeycutt v. United States \nalso is inapposite. Unlike here, Congress there gave ex-\npress textual indications that it \u201cdid not [intend to] incor-\nporate [the cited] background principles.\u201d 581 U.S. 443, \n453 (2017). There is no express disavowal here. \nFinally, Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics con-\nfirmed that courts should \u201cinfer Congress\u2019 intent to incor-\nporate a background principle into a new statute where \nthe principle has previously been applied in a similar man-\nner.\u201d 571 U.S. 161, 175 (2014). The Court there declined \nto apply that rule only because the respondents urged an \n\n6 \n \noutcome that was \u201cquite different\u201d from the background \nprinciple they invoked. Ibid. No so here. \nc. Amicus asserts (at 39-41) that any \u201cbackground \nprinciple that vacatur prohibits courts from looking at the \nhistorical fact of a sentence\u2019s imposition\u201d is overridden \nby the \u201ccountervailing background principle\u201d codified by \nthe Federal Saving Statute. Not so. \nThe Federal Saving Statute specifies that repeals of \ncriminal laws do not apply retroactively to pre-enactment \nconduct \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so expressly pro-\nvide.\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. Here, section 403(b) does expressly \nso provide, and the question is the meaning and scope of \nthat provision. That is not an issue on which the Saving \nStatute sheds light.  \nIn contending otherwise, amicus appears to take the \nposition that, in addition to establishing a default rule \nagainst retroactive application of repeals, the Federal \nSaving Statute also creates a rule of statutory construc-\ntion requiring express provisions calling for retroactive \napplication to be construed narrowly. That is not what the \nstatute says; in fact, the Court said in Dorsey v. United \nStates that the Saving Statute does not bar retroactive ap-\nplication if the repeal statute \u201ceither expressly says or at \nleast by fair implication implies the contrary.\u201d 567 U.S. \n260, 273 (2012) (emphasis added). Thus, a fair implica-\ntion is all that is needed to displace the Saving Statute\u2019s \ndefault rule. Here, there is that and more. \n2. Vacatur wipes the slate clean, as though the \nsentence never existed \nAmicus asserts (at 31-33) that there is no settled \nbackground principle that vacatur renders a sentence void \nfrom the start. He is wrong. \na. As we showed in our opening brief (at 18-20 & n.2) \nthe law has been settled since before the Founding that a \nvacated order is ordinarily treated as though it was never \n\n7 \n \nentered in the first place. As the Court has said, \u201cvacating \nthe former judgment * * * render[s] it null and void, and \nthe parties are left in the same situation as if no trial had \never taken place in the cause.\u201d United States v. Ayres, 76 \nU.S. (9 Wall.) 608, 610 (1869). \nAlong with the judgment itself, the law treats the pro-\nceeding that produced the judgment as though it never \nhappened. This general rule is why (for example) a new \ntrial following a vacated conviction does not violate dou-\nble jeopardy\u2014the vacatur \u201ceffectively erases from his-\ntory the fact of the jury\u2019s empanelment in the original \ntrial\u201d (Hewitt Br. 20), for \u201cthe original conviction has, at \nthe defendant\u2019s behest, been wholly nullified and the \nslate wiped clean.\u201d North Carolina v. Pearce, 325 U.S. \n711, 721 (1969) (citing United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. \n662 (1896)). This Court has made clear the same is true \nof sentencing proceedings. When an appellate court \n\u201cset[s] aside [a defendant\u2019s] entire sentence and re-\nmand[s] for a de novo resentencing,\u201d all legal effect from \nthe original sentencing proceeding is nullified, \u201ceffec-\ntively wip[ing] the slate clean.\u201d Pepper v. United States, \n562 U.S. 476, 507 (2011). \nAmicus dismisses (at 39) Pepper\u2019s clean slate lan-\nguage as a mere \u201cfigure of speech.\u201d Figure of speech or \nnot, it is the holding of the Court. The defendant in Pepper \nargued that the trial judge\u2019s initial decision to grant a \ndownward departure was \u201claw of the case\u201d despite that \nhis sentence had been vacated on unrelated grounds. 562 \nU.S. at 507. The Court rejected that argument because the \nvacatur order \u201cwiped the slate clean,\u201d erasing the prior \nrulings from the historical record. Ibid. \nb. According to amicus (at 31), criminal sentencings \nare exempt from this time-tested understanding of a vaca-\ntur\u2019s effect. Rather than treating a vacated sentence as \nthough it was never imposed, he insists, \u201cCongress has in \nfact required the opposite\u201d in the Sentencing Reform Act. \n\n8 \n \nWe explained in our opening brief (at 23-24) why the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act\u2014which instructs district courts to \napply the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cthat were in effect on \nthe date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior \nto the appeal\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(1))\u2014is irrelevant \nhere. Amicus talks past this point without response. \nBeyond that, amicus asserts (at 32) that Congress \nshowed in sections 921(a)(20) that when it means to limit \nthe effect of vacated judgments, it says so expressly. But \nsection 921(a)(20)\u2014which specifies what \u201cconstitutes a \nconviction\u201d for certain violent felonies\u2014does not use the \nwords \u201cvacate\u201d or \u201cvacatur.\u201d It instead carves out con-\nvictions that have been \u201cexpunged\u201d or \u201cset aside,\u201d or \n\u201cfor which a person has been pardoned or has had civil \nrights restored.\u201d Those carveouts are more inclusive than \njudicial vacatur and thus require enumeration.  \nMoreover, Congress elected with section 921 to pro-\nvide an express definition of \u201cconviction\u201d that incorpo-\nrates state law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B). It thus makes \nsense that Congress would take care to specify express \nfederal exceptions to possibly conflicting state-law doc-\ntrine. Here, Congress did not provide a general, state-law \ndefinition of \u201ca sentence\u201d from which enumerated federal \nexceptions were required.  \nc. Amicus lists (at 33) several examples supposedly \nwhere \u201c[t]he historical fact of a vacated order * * * re-\nmains legally relevant to the application of a statute.\u201d \nThose examples do not hold up. \nAmicus cites (at 33-35) two statutes under which a \nprior conviction is an element of the offense. But the ques-\ntion whether convictions under felon-in-possession and \nfailure-to-register laws must be vacated when the defend-\nant\u2019s predicate conviction is vacated is an open one in this \nCourt, so it\u2019s hard to see what relevance those provisions \nhave. We note, however, that a defendant who received an \n\n9 \n \nenhanced sentence under the ACCA may petition to have \nthe sentence corrected if a predicate conviction is later va-\ncated. See Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295, 303-\n304 (2005). The rationale for this rule is \u201cnot controver-\nsial\u201d: \u201cWhen a state court \u2018vacates\u2019 a prior conviction, it, \nin effect, nullifies that conviction; it is as if that convic-\ntion no longer exists.\u201d United States v. Sanders, 909 F.3d \n895, 902 (7th Cir. 2018). \nThe same goes for amicus\u2019s reference (at 35) to the \nimmigration laws. True, some courts have held that a con-\nviction vacated \u201cbecause the defendant had rehabilitated \nhimself or suffered some hardship\u201d may still be consid-\nered under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act. United States v. Mitchell, 38 F.4th \n382, 393 (3d Cir. 2022) (Bibas, J., concurring). But the \nopinion of the Board of Immigration Appeals on that point \nhistorically has been granted Chevron deference, so the \nquestion whether it is correct has not been explored inde-\npendently by the lower courts or resolved by this Court. \nAnd even under IIRIRA, \u201cif a conviction is legally defec-\ntive\u201d on its merits, \u201cit is void from the start\u201d and \u201cno \nlonger counts as a conviction for immigration purposes.\u201d \nMitchell, 38 F.4th at 393 (Bibas, J., concurring). \nAmicus\u2019s citation to fraud (at 35) is also unhelpful. \nWhen someone lies about a past conviction, the statement \nis not made retroactively truthful by a later vacatur. What \nmakes a lie untruthful are the facts at the time of the \nspeaking. And an offense is committed when it is com-\npleted. Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970). \nFinally, amicus points (at 33-34) to Bravo-Fernandez \nv. United States, but that case supports our position. The \nCourt there confirmed that courts cannot \u201cgive[] effect to \n[a] vacated judgment,\u201d which is why retrial following va-\ncatur does not \u201coffend[] double jeopardy principles.\u201d 580 \nU.S. 5, 18 (2016). At the same time, this Court has said \nthat when a verdict is vacated for lack of sufficient \n\n10 \n \nevidence, retrial is not permissible because an appellate \ndetermination that \u201cthe evidence [was] insufficient to \nconvict is equivalent to an acquittal.\u201d Id. at 20. That gen-\neral rule does not give the original verdict continuing ef-\nfect; on the contrary, it calls for entry of a new judgment \nof dismissal because the government lacks sufficient evi-\ndence to sustain a retrial. Ibid. The question in Bravo-Fer-\nnandez was only whether the petitioners there were enti-\ntled to such relief. The Court\u2019s answer (no) does not call \ninto question the general rule that a vacatur eliminates \nthe legal effect ab initio of a prior judgment. \nIn all events, these strained examples are at most \nnarrow exceptions that prove the rule. A background legal \nprinciple does not have to be perfectly exceptionless for \nthe text of a statute presumptively to incorporate it. \nB. The surrounding text confirms our reading  \nThe text surrounding \u201csentence\u201d confirms our inter-\npretation. When amicus asserts (at 2) that we \u201cseek to re-\nwrite\u201d the text \u201cin multiple ways,\u201d he has it backward.  \n1. Congress\u2019s uses of the present-perfect tense \nand \u201cas of\u201d indicate an ongoing condition \na. We explained in the opening brief (at 25-28) that \nCongress\u2019s decision in section 403(b) to use the present-\nperfect tense (\u201chas not been\u201d) indicates that it was con-\ncerned with the imposition of a sentencing \u201cbeginning in \nthe past and extending up to now.\u201d R. Huddleston & G. \nPullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language \n143 (2002). If Congress had intended to focus only with \nthe historical fact that a sentence was imposed at a \nsingular point in time prior to the FSA\u2019s enactment, it \nwould have used the past-perfect tense (\u201chad been \nimposed\u201d) or simple past tense (\u201cwas imposed\u201d) with a \npreposition like \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cprior to.\u201d  \nPerhaps the most striking support for this point is \nthat amicus alters the text in precisely these ways to make \n\n11 \n \nhis position grammatical. For instance, on page 16 of his \nbrief, he explains (emphasis ours) that \u201c[p]etitioners in-\ndisputably had been sentenced for the offenses at issue \n(twice) before the First Step Act took effect.\u201d The lower \ncourts aligned with the amicus have done the same. See, \ne.g., Pet. App. 11a (denying relief because \u201c[a]ppellants\u2019 \noffenses had been imposed upon them prior to the * * * en-\nactment date\u201d) (emphasis added); United States v. Uri-\narte, 975 F.3d 596, 610 (7th Cir. 2020) (Barrett, J., dis-\nsenting) (\u201cHere, Congress picked a line: the applicability \nof the First Step Act turns on whether a sentence had been \nimposed on the defendant before the date of enactment.\u201d) \n(emphasis added). \nThe distinction is especially notable because, as we \nobserved in the in our opening brief (at 29-30), Congress \nelsewhere in the FSA conditioned relief on the historical \nfact of past pronouncement of a sentence by using the past \ntense. See FSA \u00a7 404(c) (\u201c[n]o court shall entertain a mo-\ntion made under this section to reduce a sentence if the \nsentence was previously imposed or previously reduced\u201d \nunder certain circumstances) (emphasis added). Again \nignoring context, amicus gives no response. \nb. Amicus insists that his position does not require \nrevising the tense and preposition that Congress chose, \nbut his efforts are not persuasive.  \nFirst, amicus characterizes (24-25) the present-per-\nfect tense as describing a \u201ccondition that is either now \ncompleted or continues to the present,\u201d asserting that the \nformer is \u201cthe more logical application\u201d here. But that is \na distinction without a relevant difference: both meanings \nconcern the \u201cnow\u201d or the \u201cpresent.\u201d Rather than describ-\ning a \u201chistorical fact\u201d (id. at 24) that was completed at a \ndefinite point in the past, the present-perfect tense de-\nscribes a \u201ccombin[ation] [of] past and present\u201d (Cam-\nbridge Grammar 142) under either meaning.  \n\n12 \n \nAnd amicus does himself no good to suggest (at 25) \nthat section 403(b) describes a sentence \u201cas having been \ncompleted at some indefinite time in the past\u201d because \nthe crux of his argument is that a sentence was imposed \nat a definite \u201cfixed point in time\u201d in the past. Ibid.  \nSecond, amicus says (at 25) that \u201cCongress pegged \nthe inquiry\u201d to whether a sentence has been imposed \u201cas \nof the Act\u2019s date of enactment,\u201d which is in the past.  \nWe do not disagree. Out position is simply that the \ncombination of the present-perfect tense with \u201cas of\u201d \nmust be taken to ask not only whether the sentence was \npronounced at a fixed time prior to the FSA\u2019s enactment, \nbut also whether it remains imposed now, at the time of \nreading the statute.  \nThird, amicus\u2014quoting from United States v. Her-\nnandez, 107 F.4th 965, 970 (11th Cir. 2024)\u2014says (at \n26) that using the past-perfect would have made a \u201csyn-\ntactical hash\u201d of the statute. But to reach that conclusion, \nthe Eleventh Circuit assumed that a statute is read from \nthe drafters\u2019 perspective at the time of enactment, allow-\ning the court to \u201cparaphrase\u201d section 403(b) as saying \n\u201cas of today\u201d rather than \u201cas of [the] date of enactment.\u201d \n107 F.4th at 970. And it would make no sense to say that \n\u201ca sentence had been imposed as of today.\u201d Ibid. (empha-\nsis added). \nThat argument rests on a clear error of construction. \nCongress drafts laws to \u201cspeak at the time of reading\u201d \nand not \u201cat the time of their adoption.\u201d Hewitt Br. 27 n.3 \n(quoting Carr v. United States, 560 U.S. 438, 464 (2010) \n(Alito, J., dissenting)). The House Legislative Counsel\u2019s \nManual on Drafting Style states this expressly: A statute \nis to be written so that it \u201cspeaks as of whatever time it is \nbeing read (rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put \ninto effect).\u201d HLC No. 104\u20131, \u00a7 102(c), p. 2 (1995). The \nquestion posed by section 403(b), therefore, is whether at \n\n13 \n \nthe time of the reading of the statute\u2014that is, at the time \nof a resentencing\u2014a sentence \u201chas been\u201d imposed \u201cas of \n[the] date of enactment.\u201d  \nFrom that perspective, using the past-perfect would \nhave been the only way to reach the Fifth Circuit\u2019s result \nin this case. The past-perfect refers to a past action that \noccurred anterior to a more recent past action. See gener-\nally Cambridge Grammar 139-142. Thus, if the question \nwere whether, at the time of resentencing, some past \nevent (the pronouncement of a sentence) had taken place \nbefore some other past event (the enactment of the FSA), \nthe past-perfect tense would be the only appropriate tense \nto use. That, of course, is not the tense that Congress se-\nlected. And the only logical way to understand its use of \nthe present-perfect, instead, is that it intended to ask \nwhether a sentence was imposed prior to the FSA\u2019s enact-\nment and remains imposed now. \nc. Amicus\u2019s reliance (at 28-29) on Lewis v. United \nStates is bewildering. The Court there addressed whether \nan \u201cextant prior conviction * * * may constitute the pred-\nicate for a subsequent conviction\u201d when the defendant \nhas not yet obtained a vacatur but contends the conviction \nwas unlawful. 445 U.S. 55, 56 (1980). The Court held \nnot. In doing so, it expressly distinguished the facts pre-\nsented there from a case (like this one) in which a convic-\ntion has actually been reversed or vacated and \u201cthus no \nlonger [is] outstanding.\u201d Id. at 61 n.5. As to that scenario, \nthe Court readily \u201creject[ed]\u201d the notion that a vacated \nconviction could be used as a predicate, characterizing as \n\u201cextreme\u201d any argument to the contrary. Ibid. \n2. The words \u201cimposed\u201d and \u201ca\u201d do not counsel \na different result \na. Against all this, amicus leans (at 21-24) on the \nword \u201cimposed.\u201d As he sees it, when Congress said that \nsection 403(a) shall apply \u201cif a sentence for the offense \n\n14 \n \nhas not been imposed as of\u201d December 21, 2018 (FSA \n\u00a7 403(b)), it actually meant \u201cif a sentence was not pro-\nnounced before\u201d that date. But we explained in our \nopening brief (at 28-29) that \u201cimposed\u201d has two possible \nmeanings, one of which refers to an ongoing condition: A \nsentence remains imposed until it is vacated. Section \n403(b)\u2019s use of the present-perfect and \u201cas of\u201d indicate \nunambiguously that Congress intended the \u201congoing \ncondition\u201d version of the word. \nAmicus talks past this argument, citing other statutes \nand cases in which \u201cimpose\u201d has been interpreted to refer \nto a singular past event. None of that responds to our point \nthat the unique context of section 403(b)\u2014including the \n\u201cphraseology\u201d (McBoyle, 283 U.S. at 27) and \u201cpurpose\u201d \n(Reading Law 56) of the statute\u2014compel a different out-\ncome here. \nAmicus\u2019s only other attempt at a response is to say \n(at 22) that Congress could not have meant an ongoing \ncondition because it did not use an \u201c\u2018imposed on\u2019 struc-\nture.\u201d But the \u201con\u201d preposition is neither necessary nor \nsufficient to indicate the ongoing-condition meaning of \nthe word. The version that Congress intended (singular \nevent or ongoing condition) therefore must be determined \n\u201cby context.\u201d Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-\n132 (1993). Amicus\u2019s preferred interpretation requires \nthe Court to read \u201cimposed\u201d in a vacuum. \nb. Amicus contends (at 17-18) that Congress\u2019s use of \nthe indefinite article (\u201ca\u201d) must be taken as a reference to \n\u201cany sentence that has been imposed for the offense, even \none that was subsequently vacated.\u201d \nThere are two problems with that position. To begin \nwith, it ignores our argument concerning vacatur and the \nbackground principle against which Congress acted. \nAgain, Congress would not have understood \u201ca sentence\u201d \nto include a vacated sentence, because a vacated sentence \n\n15 \n \nis no sentence at all. If Congress had wanted to override \nthat ancient background principle, it would have said so \nexpressly. It did not. \nThat aside, amicus is wrong that \u201ca\u201d and \u201cany\u201d are \nsynonymous. \u201cAs this Court has repeatedly explained, \nthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning,\u201d indicating \n\u201cone or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.\u201d Patel v. \nGarland, 596 U.S. 328, 338 (2022) (cleaned up). The \nterm \u201cany\u201d thus \u201cleaves no doubt as to the congressional \nintention to include all\u201d members of the category identi-\nfied, without any limitation. United States v. Rosen-\nwasser, 323 U.S. 360, 363 (1945).  \nAs amicus acknowledges (at 17), the indefinite article \n\u201ca\u201d simply \u201cmeans \u2018some undetermined or unspecified \nparticular.\u2019\u201d McFadden v. United States, 576 U.S. 186, \n191 (2015). Congress\u2019s use of the indefinite article before \n\u201csentence\u201d thus indicates only that it was referring to a \nnon-specific, rather than a particular, sentence. If the \noriginal sentence had been vacated, but a new and valid \nsentence \u201chas been imposed as of\u201d the enactment date, \nrelief would be unavailable. That is a different meaning \nfrom \u201cany,\u201d which is why Congress does not vacillate be-\ntween \u201ca\u201d and \u201cany\u201d willy nilly, as though the two were \nperfectly interchangeable. Amicus thus once again pro-\nposes to rewrite the statute. \nC. All remaining considerations support reversal \nWe have shown that amicus\u2019s position is inconsistent \nwith long settled background principles and requires re-\nwriting the statute in at least two ways. That is more than \nenough for reversal. But there is more. \n1. Our reading is the only one consistent with \nthe FSA\u2019s undisputed purpose \na. To start, amicus\u2019s position creates nonsensical \nresults that are directly counter to the undisputed purpose \nof section 403. \n\n16 \n \nNo one disputes that one of Congress\u2019s prime objec-\ntives with the FSA was to ensure that sentence stacking \nstopped on the date of enactment. It thus included section \n403(b) to make clear that the act\u2019s sentencing reforms \nwould apply not just to all crimes committed after the date \nof enactment, but to all crimes sentenced after that date.  \nThere is no logical reason Congress would have in-\ntended to forbid sentence stacking for plenary sentencings \ntaking place after enactment, while preserving the prac-\ntice for plenary resentencings. All textual evidence is that \nCongress meant to draw the line at finality: The FSA does \nnot authorize reopening final criminal judgments that im-\nposed stacked sentences. Balancing fairness against final-\nity, it instead bars only the imposition of new stacked sen-\ntences in post-enactment plenary proceedings. As a mat-\nter of common sense, that includes  de novo resentencings \njust as well as initial sentencings. See Hewitt Br. 31-35; \nACLU et al. Br. 23-26. \nAmicus denies finality is the principle that Congress \nused to draw the line between relief and no relief. But he \noffers no alternative line-drawing principle that Congress \nwould have chosen instead. He does suggest (at 46) that \nCongress was concerned with administrability and notes \nthat his rule \u201ccan be easily applied.\u201d But that is equally \ntrue of our rule\u2014it is hardly a challenge to determine \nwhether a plenary resentencing takes place after the date \nof the FSA\u2019s enactment. \nBeyond that, amicus asserts that our reading of \nsection 403(b) \u201cwould invite unfairness.\u201d But arbitrary \ndifferences in sentencing decisions are an inevitable re-\nsult of any law that changes sentencing rules. See Dorsey, \n567 U.S. at 280 (some degree of unfairness \u201cwill exist \nwhenever Congress enacts a new law changing sen-\ntences\u201d). The focus of \u201cmodern sentencing statutes\u201d is \nfairness in \u201croughly contemporaneous sentencing.\u201d Id. at \n277. Amicus, for his part, highlights different treatment \n\n17 \n \nbetween those sentenced at different times: Under our \nrule, any sentence imposed prior to December 21, 2018, \nmay be stacked, whereas any imposed afterward may not \nbe. Amicus\u2019s rule, in contrast, produces disparities among \nthose sentenced at \u201cthe same time, the same place, and \neven by the same judge\u201d for the same or similar offense \nconduct. Ibid. That is the \u201ckind of unfairness\u201d that \nCongress is presumed to avoid. Ibid.2, 3 \nReading section 403(b) to apply the FSA\u2019s reforms at \nall plenary post-enactment sentencing and resentencings \nis by far the more sensible of the two proposed ap-\nproaches. See Hewitt Br. 31; Gov. Br. 23-25; Duffey Br. \n36. The Senators\u2019 amicus brief confirms our argument  \non this score. It explains (at 15) that \u201c[t]he purpose of the \nFirst Step Act was to enact comprehensive, ameliorative \nreforms to the overly harsh mandatory minimum \nsentencing schemes.\u201d But Congress \u201cbalanced this retro-\nactive purpose with an interest in preserving sentences \nthat were actually valid and final.\u201d Ibid. Petitioners\u2019 \nreading of section 403(b) \u201cbest fulfills [the FSA]\u2019s \nstatutory objectives\u201d so understood. Brown v. United \nStates, 602 U.S. 101, 113 (2024). \nb. Unable to offer an account of why Congress would \nhave intended his proposed reading, amicus characterizes \n(at 44-47) any attention to Congress\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d or \n \n2  Amicus asserts (at 46) that our rule would \u201cillogically\u201d favor a de-\nfendant who delayed his district court or appellate proceedings to ob-\ntain a post-enactment vacatur. But the same is true of amicus\u2019s rule, \nwhich would reward the delay tactics of defendants waiting for initial \nsentencings in the months before the FSA\u2019s adoption.  \n3  Amicus is wrong that only defendants engaged in \u201cmore dangerous \nbehavior\u201d get the benefit of our rule. Br. 47. For example, after \nUnited States v. Taylor, 596 U.S. 845 (2015), offenders who only \nattempted a Hobbs Act Robbery are entitled to resentencing, while \nthose who completed their crimes are not.  \n\n18 \n \n\u201cobjective\u201d as an impermissible, atextual \u201cpolicy con-\ncern.\u201d That is wrong.  \nAgain, a court construing a statute must always \u201cin-\nterpret the relevant words not in a vacuum, but with ref-\nerence to the statutory context, \u2018structure, history, and \npurpose.\u2019\u201d Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179 \n(2014) (quoting Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 \n(2013)). Authorities sometimes refer to these considera-\ntions together as the complete \u201ccontext\u201d of the statute. \nE.g., Biden, 143 S. Ct. at 2378 (Barrett, J., concurring) \n(citing Easterbrook, Speluncean Explorers, supra at \n1913). In that sense, \u201ccontext includes the purpose of the \ntext.\u201d Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2110 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., joined by Roberts, C.J.; So-\ntomayor, J.; and Kagan, J., dissenting) (quoting Reading \nLaw 56). Accord Reading Law 63 (\u201cinterpretation always \ndepends on context\u201d and \u201ccontext always includes evi-\ndent purpose\u201d).  \nTo say so is not to make \u201ctextualist interpretation\u201d \nsynonymous with \u201cpurposive interpretation.\u201d Reading \nLaw 56. Rather, it is simply to acknowledge that part of \nthe context that gives meaning to statutory language is \nthe purpose for which it was adopted\u2014at least as long as \n\u201cthe purpose [can be] derived from the text.\u201d Ibid.  \nAs we have said, the text here reveals a single, clear \npurpose: to ensure that no new stacked sentences would \nbe imposed after the date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. Section \n403(b) best effectuates that purpose when it is inter-\npreted to provide that the FSA\u2019s sentencing reforms apply \nto all plenary sentencings after that date, no matter \nwhether it is a plenary initial sentencing or a plenary re-\nsentencing. \nIn making this argument, we do not ask the Court to \n\u201coverride\u201d the text of the statute. See Amicus Br. 44. Our \npoint is only that if the Court concludes that there are two \n\n19 \n \ntheoretically possible readings of the relevant statutory \nphrase, and the first effectuates the evident purpose of the \nprovision while the second flatly contradicts it, the Court \nshould conclude that the \u201csingle, best meaning\u201d (Loper \nBright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 \n(2024)) is the first one. In other words, \u201c[f]aced with a \nchoice between two [alternative] readings,\u201d the Court \nought \u201cto adopt the interpretation that makes the most \nsense\u201d in light of Congress\u2019s clear objective. Johnson v. \nUnited States, 529 U.S. 694, 714 (2000) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring). \nTo contend otherwise is to say that the Court must \nuse grammar rules to override Congress\u2019s intent with sec-\ntion 403(b), interpreting it to achieve the opposite of Con-\ngress\u2019s clear purpose. That is not the law. And it is telling \nhow strongly amicus pushes back on that point. \n2. The rule of lenity forecloses amicus\u2019s \ninterpretation \nIf there is any doubt about Section 403(b)\u2019s meaning, \nthe rule of lenity breaks the tie for petitioners. Amicus\u2019s \npolicy reasons why the rule of lenity should not apply in \nthe context of the \u201cretroactivity of a sentencing provi-\nsion\u201d (Br. 48) do not support a different conclusion. \nAs a starting point, this Court has already held that \nthe rule of lenity applies \u201cnot only to interpretations of \nthe substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to \nthe penalties they impose.\u201d Bifulco v. United States, 447 \nU.S. 381, 387 (1980) (collecting cases)); United States v. \nGranderson, 511 U.S. 39, 42-43 (1994) (applying lenity \nto resentencing after probation revocation). We described \nthis precedent in our opening brief (at 35, 37), but amicus \nnowhere addresses these cases or explains why they \nshould be overruled.  \nAnyway, the two policy rationales amicus offers are \nunpersuasive on their own terms.  \n\n20 \n \nFirst, amicus contends (Br. 48-49) that there are no \n\u201cfair warning\u201d concerns that lenity would fulfill in this \ncontext. But fair warning is just one of the several reasons \nwhy the rule of lenity exists. See Pulsifer v. United States, \n601 U.S. 124, 185 (2024) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). \nThose weighty interests include the \u201cpresumption of in-\ndividual liberty,\u201d ensuring that \u201conly the people\u2019s elected \nrepresentatives, not their judges, are vested with the \npower to \u2018define a crime, and ordain its punishment,\u2019\u201d \nand \u201cguarding against the possibility that judges might \ncondemn unpopular individuals to punishment\u201d based on \ntheir own views of \u201cgood public policy\u201d or \u201cno more than \na guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d Id. at 755-756. \nAll of those considerations have powerful force here.  \nSecond, amicus suggests (at 49) that the rule of lenity \ndoes not apply here because the Federal Saving Statute \noverrides it. That simply is not so. That statute creates a \ndefault rule against retroactive application of defendant-\nfavorable repeals of criminal laws. It does not create a \ncanon requiring narrow constructions of express statu-\ntory exceptions to the default rule. See supra, at 6.  \nPetitioners here contend that section 403(b) applies \nto them; amicus contends that it does not. We believe our \ninterpretation is correct as a matter of plain language, \nproperly read in its full context. But if the Court concludes \nthat section 403(b)\u2019s text is ambiguous, the rule of lenity \nmust break the interpretive logjam in petitioners\u2019 favor.  \n \n \n\n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe court of appeals\u2019 judgment should be reversed \nand the case should be remanded for resentencing. \nRespectfully submitted. \nEugene R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape in *Hewitt v. United States* continues to evolve. While the latest observation did not yield the court-appointed amicus brief I was seeking, it provided the Petitioner's Reply Brief, which adds significant context to the procedural history and sharpens my understanding of the arguments that led the Court to grant review.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument Framework (Stable):** My belief that the petitioner's case is built on a strong foundation remains unchanged. The core arguments are a textualist reading of Section 403(b)'s \"has been imposed\" clause, the legal fiction that a vacated sentence is a nullity (*Burks v. United States*), the principle of applying current law at a *de novo* resentencing (*Pepper v. United States*), and the rule of lenity. The new observation does not alter these fundamental legal pillars.\n\n2.  **Executive Branch Position (Updated and Nuanced):** My prior belief that the Solicitor General's confession of error is a powerful signal for reversal is now more nuanced. The Petitioner's Reply Brief reveals that while the government agrees the Fifth Circuit's decision was \"wrongly decided,\" it \"strangely resist[ed]\" the Supreme Court's intervention. The government argued against granting certiorari on the grounds that the issue had \"limited prospective importance\" and that a pending (but stalled) bill in Congress might resolve the issue. This reveals a complex, somewhat contradictory posture. However, since the Court granted review anyway, the government's opposition to cert is now a historical footnote. The dominant signal remains its agreement with the petitioner on the merits of the legal question, which still strongly favors reversal.\n\n3.  **Broadened Scope and Stakes of the Case (Reinforced):** The reply brief powerfully reinforces my updated belief about the case's high stakes. It directly refutes the government's claim of \"limited prospective importance\" by highlighting that the sentencing disparities involve \"decades or centuries of incarceration.\" It explicitly cites the NACDL and ACLU amicus briefs to confirm that the ruling will affect \"many thousands of defendants\" under both the firearms provision (\u00a7 403) and the far more common drug offense provision (\u00a7 401). This strengthens my assessment that the Court views this as a nationally significant case requiring a clear resolution.\n\n4.  **Reinforced Purposive Argument (Stable):** The reply brief's emphasis on rectifying \"unwarranted sentencing disparities\" and the \"intolerable\" variability in the justice system aligns perfectly with the purposive arguments detailed in the NACDL brief. It frames the case as a matter of fundamental fairness and fulfilling the clear, bipartisan intent of the First Step Act.\n\n5.  **Urgency and Necessity of Supreme Court Review (New Belief):** The reply brief provides a compelling new narrative about *why* the Court's intervention was essential. It details a \"firmly entrenched\" 2-2 circuit split, referencing ten different judicial opinions on the matter. Crucially, it reveals that the government's prior strategy to resolve the split by acquiescing to an en banc rehearing in the Sixth Circuit was \"rebuffed.\" This fact demonstrates that the lower courts could not resolve the conflict themselves, making the Supreme Court the \"only tribunal that can end the dispute.\" This context strengthens the rationale for a decisive ruling from the Court.\n\n6.  **Analytical Gap Remains Critical (Stable and Heightened):** The search action again failed to retrieve the brief from the court-appointed amicus curiae who will argue in support of the judgment below. This failure is significant. It confirms that my understanding of the case is based almost entirely on pro-petitioner arguments. The government's refusal to defend the lower court's decision prompted the Supreme Court to appoint an outside lawyer specifically to formulate and present the strongest possible counterarguments. The Justices will give these arguments serious consideration, and they represent the biggest unknown in my predictive model. The need to obtain and analyze this brief is now more critical than ever to developing a complete and robust prediction.",

The combined arguments of the Petitioner and the Solicitor General are compelling on textual, contextual, and purposive grounds.\n\n1.  **Textual Argument:** The use of the present-perfect tense (\"has not been imposed\") in Section 403(b) strongly suggests a condition that continues to the present. A vacated sentence is a legal nullity and thus is not \"imposed\" at the time of resentencing. The amicus's counter-argument, which reads \"has\" as a historical fact (equivalent to \"had\"), appears to be a strained and acontextual interpretation.\n\n2.  **Statutory Context:** The Government's identification of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) is a critical piece of evidence. This parallel statute uses the identical phrase \"has been imposed\" to unambiguously refer to a *currently valid and operative* sentence. The amicus's failure to address or distinguish this internal statutory context is a significant flaw in the argument for affirmance.\n\n3.  **Legal Background Principles:** The \"clean slate\" doctrine, articulated in *Pepper v. United States*, establishes that a vacated sentence is wiped clean, as if it never existed for the purpose of the new sentencing. This long-standing legal convention provides a crucial backdrop against which Congress legislated, and it strongly supports the petitioner's reading.\n\n4.  **Purpose and Finality:** The amicus's interpretation would lead to the absurd result of forcing courts to reimpose lengthy sentences under a \"stacking\" regime that Congress explicitly found to be unjust and repealed. This frustrates the core purpose of the First Step Act without serving any compelling interest in finality, as resentencing is already required in these cases.\n\n5.  **Advocate Alignment:** The U.S. Solicitor General is not just passively agreeing with the petitioner but is forcefully arguing for reversal, even stating that the rule of lenity is \"unwarranted\" because the text is so clear. This is a powerful signal of the government's confidence and is often persuasive to the Court.\n\nThe arguments for affirmance, as reconstructed from the replies, rest on a brittle, literalist interpretation that ignores statutory context, legal conventions, and legislative purpose.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, containing the reply briefs from both the Petitioner and the U.S. Government, marks a significant turning point in my understanding of this case. While the court-appointed amicus brief itself was not retrieved, these replies are written in direct refutation of it, allowing me to reconstruct the amicus's arguments with high fidelity. This has substantially closed my most critical analytical gap and brought the central legal conflicts into sharp focus.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Argument Framework (Stable and Sharpened):** My belief in the strength of the petitioner's core arguments\u2014a textualist reading of the present-perfect tense in Section 403(b), the \"clean slate\" effect of a vacated sentence (*Pepper v. United States*), and the rule of lenity\u2014remains stable. The reply brief sharpens this by framing the debate as one of \"textualism\" (reading legal terms in their established legal context) versus \"literalism\" (a hyper-technical, acontextual reading). This methodological framing seems designed to appeal to the Court's textualist jurists by arguing that background legal principles, like the effect of vacatur, are an intrinsic part of the text's meaning, not an \"extratextual\" consideration.\n\n2.  **Executive Branch Position (Updated and Solidified):** My previous belief that the Solicitor General's position was nuanced due to its initial opposition to certiorari is now fully updated. The Government's reply brief demonstrates it is not merely a passive supporter of the petitioner but an active and forceful advocate for reversal. The brief methodically dismantles the amicus's arguments on textual, contextual, and purposive grounds. The Government's confidence is underscored by its assertion that the rule of lenity is \"unwarranted,\" signaling its belief that the petitioner's reading is unambiguously correct based on the text alone.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Clarified):** The case now clearly hinges on the interpretation of the phrase \"if a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of [the Act's] date of enactment.\"\n    *   **Petitioner/Government Position:** The use of the present-perfect tense (\"has...been imposed\") refers to a state that continues to the present. A vacated sentence has no ongoing legal validity and is a nullity; therefore, at the time of resentencing, no sentence \"has been imposed.\" They argue this reading is confirmed by the identical phrasing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), where it unambiguously refers to a *currently valid* sentence.\n    *   **Amicus Position (Reconstructed):** The amicus argues that \"has...been imposed\" refers to a *historical fact*. If a sentence was ever imposed before the Act's enactment date, the condition is met, and the defendant is ineligible for relief, regardless of the sentence's subsequent vacatur. The amicus reads the \"as of\" clause as freezing the inquiry at that specific date, rendering later events irrelevant.\n\n4.  **Analytical Gap (Substantially Closed):** My prior, critical uncertainty about the arguments supporting the lower court's judgment is now resolved. The reply briefs reveal the amicus's case rests on a \"historical fact\" theory that transforms the statute's present-perfect tense (\"has\") into a past-perfect tense (\"had\"). This argument appears to prioritize a rigid grammatical reading over statutory context (like \u00a7 3582(c)), background legal conventions (the effect of vacatur), and the acknowledged purpose of the First Step Act. Having sight of these counterarguments is a major step toward a confident prediction.\n\n5.  **Key Statutory Context Identified (New Belief):** The Government's reply brief introduces a powerful piece of contextual evidence: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). This statute, which governs the modification of sentences, uses the same \"has been imposed\" language to refer to a sentence that is currently in force and legally operative. The fact that the amicus apparently failed to address or distinguish this parallel usage is a significant weakness in the argument for affirmance and a major strength for the petitioner's side. This provides a strong, internal statutory clue that the Court is likely to find persuasive.\n\n6.  **Purposive Argument (Reinforced):** The reply briefs strongly reinforce the purposive argument by painting the amicus's interpretation as leading to an absurd result: forcing courts to reimpose decades-long sentences under a scheme Congress explicitly rejected as overly harsh, with no corresponding benefit to judicial finality (since resentencing is already required). This frames the amicus's position as frustrating, rather than effectuating, legislative intent.\n\nMy overall assessment is that the case for reversal has been significantly strengthened. The arguments advanced by the Petitioner and the Government appear more coherent, textually grounded in relevant statutory context, and aligned with the law's purpose. The reconstructed argument for affirmance appears brittle, overly literal, and disconnected from both legal context and legislative goals.",

The assertion that the rule of lenity is \"unwarranted\" is a declaration of confidence that the petitioner's reading is not just plausible but unambiguously correct, a stance that carries significant weight with the Court.\n\n3.  **The Central Legal Clash (Resolved):** The core interpretive dispute over \"if a sentence for the offense has not been imposed\" is now resolved in my analysis.\n    *   **Winning Argument (Petitioner/Government):** The present-perfect tense (\"has...been imposed\") refers to a sentence with ongoing legal effect. A vacated sentence is a nullity; therefore, at resentencing, no sentence *is* imposed. This reading is decisively supported by precedent (*Pepper*) and parallel statutory context (\u00a7 3582(c)).\n    *   **Losing Argument (Amicus):** The reconstructed amicus argument\u2014that \"has...been imposed\" is a historical snapshot freezing eligibility at the date of enactment\u2014is brittle. It requires reading the present-perfect tense as a past-perfect tense (\"had been imposed\") and ignores the fundamental legal effect of vacatur, making it appear strained and disconnected from legal reality.\n\n4.  **Analytical Gap (Fully Closed):** My critical uncertainty regarding the arguments for affirmance is now fully closed. The reply briefs have allowed for a complete reconstruction and subsequent deconstruction of the amicus's case. It rests on a hyper-literal interpretation that is vulnerable on textual, contextual, and purposive grounds.\n\n5.  **Key Statutory Context (Confirmed as Decisive):** The Government's introduction of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) remains a pivotal, and now likely decisive, piece of evidence. Its use of the identical phrase \"has been imposed\" to refer to a *currently operative* sentence provides a powerful internal statutory clue that Congress intends the phrase to have a consistent meaning. The amicus's apparent failure to rebut this point is a critical and likely fatal weakness.\n\n6.  **Purposive Argument (Solidified as a Barrier to Affirmance):** The argument that the amicus's interpretation leads to an absurd result is now a solid backstop against affirmance. It would compel courts to knowingly reimpose sentences under a scheme Congress explicitly repealed as unjust, all while serving no purpose of judicial finality (as resentencing is already happening). This makes the amicus's reading appear not only legally incorrect but also profoundly contrary to legislative intent.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has reached a point of high certainty. The arguments for reversal are coherent, mutually reinforcing, and grounded in text, context, and purpose. The arguments for affirmance are fragile and appear to fail on every front. The alignment of the Petitioner and the U.S. Government creates a unified and formidable front that is very likely to persuade the Court.",
