    "legal_questions": [
      "Can U.S. gun manufacturers be held liable for violence in Mexico under theories of proximate causation and aiding and abetting, based on their domestic production and sale of firearms that are later trafficked to Mexican cartels?"

      "No"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "The Mexican government sued several U.S. gun manufacturers in federal court, alleging their practices facilitated illegal gun trafficking to Mexican drug cartels, causing harm to Mexico. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the lawsuit was barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prohibits certain lawsuits against gun manufacturers. The district court dismissed the case, holding that the PLCAA applied and barred Mexico's claims. Mexico appealed.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that while the PLCAA does apply to lawsuits by foreign governments for harm suffered abroad, Mexico\u2019s lawsuit falls within the statute\u2019s \u201cpredicate exception\u201d for claims alleging knowing violations of laws applicable to gun sales. The court found Mexico adequately alleged that the defendants aided and abetted illegal gun trafficking in violation of U.S. laws, and that this proximately caused harm to Mexico. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments that the causal chain was too attenuated, finding Mexico plausibly alleged direct harm from having to combat well-armed cartels. The court remanded the case for further proceedings, allowing Mexico's lawsuit to move forward.",

The core issue is whether the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) bars Mexico's lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers. The First Circuit said the suit could proceed under the PLCAA's 'predicate exception.' The key task parameters (\u03b8) I need to understand are: the specific legal arguments the petitioners (gun manufacturers) are making to the Supreme Court, the respondent's (Mexico's) counter-arguments, the interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception, and the application of proximate cause principles in this context. The best first step to gain information about these parameters is to find and analyze the primary documents filed in the case. I will start by searching for the brief filed by the petitioners, as this will outline their core arguments for why the Supreme Court should overturn the First Circuit's decision.

      "eig_reasoning": "This THINK action is a crucial first step that significantly structures the problem space. \n\nTask EIG is high (0.7) because it moves the agent from a state of zero knowledge to having a clear, actionable model of the key parameters (\u03b8) needed for prediction: the specific arguments regarding the PLCAA's predicate exception and proximate cause. While it doesn't gather external data, it creates a precise plan to do so, which is a massive gain in understanding how to solve this specific task. It correctly identifies that the petitioner's brief is the most information-rich document to target first.\n\nDesign EIG is even higher (0.8) because the thought process models a highly effective and generalizable strategy for SCOTUS prediction: 1) Deconstruct the case summary to identify the core legal conflict. 2) Define the key arguments as the primary variables. 3) Formulate a plan to acquire primary source documents, starting with the petitioner's filing. This 'identify-plan-search' workflow is a cornerstone of efficient legal analysis and provides strong evidence for a successful agent design (D).\n\nJoint EIG is therefore very high. This action sets the entire investigation on a successful trajectory, providing significant value for both the immediate task and for understanding general strategy.",

Reading the brief will provide a precise understanding of the petitioner's arguments on the PLCAA's predicate exception and proximate causation, dramatically reducing uncertainty and refining my model of the case. This makes the Task EIG extremely high. The Design EIG is moderate; while reading the primary briefs is a foundational strategy, analyzing the specific structure and substance of the petitioner's arguments in a complex statutory case provides a valuable data point for the general design, refining the model of what constitutes a persuasive argument to the Court.

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailer\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailers or buyers\u2014such \nas requiring them to show some \u201clegitimate need\u201d \nbefore buying an AR-15. Id. 104a (\u00b6 315).  \nBecause Petitioners allegedly know that some \ndownstream dealers make unlawful sales, and \nbecause they have failed to adopt measures to stop \nsuch sales, Mexico alleges that they are an \u201caccessory\u201d \nto those sales. Namely, Petitioners \u201ccontinue[] to \nsupply, support, or assist\u201d those sales\u2014i.e., they have \ncontinued \nlongstanding \nmanufacturing \nand \ndistribution practices\u2014even with the \u201cknowledge\u201d \nthat some criminals have been able to exploit the \nstatus quo, leading to a flow of firearms being \nsmuggled into Mexico. Id. 42a (\u00b6 110); BIO 25-26. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nBased on these allegations, Mexico asserts a wide \nvariety of claims, primarily under Mexican tort law \n(which it insists should apply). Id. 183a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 506-\n60). The complaint seeks $10 billion in damages. See \nid. \n195a-96a. \nIt \nalso \nrequests \ntransformative \ninjunctive relief, id.\u2014including, among much else, a \nban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d; a ban on firearms capable \nof holding \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d; strict limits on \n\u201cmultiple sales\u201d of firearms; and far-reaching \nbackground checks, beyond what American law now \nrequires. See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 132a-34a, 140a-41 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369, 379-84).  \nC. The Decisions Below. \nThe district court dismissed Mexico\u2019s suit in full. \nThe court first rejected Mexico\u2019s \u201cextraterritoriality\u201d \nargument, holding that PLCAA fully applies to suits \nbrought by foreign sovereigns in American courts \nagainst American firearms companies based on their \ndomestic \noperations \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nPet.App.233a-239a. The district court further held \nthat Mexico\u2019s case is \u201cexactly\u201d the \u201ctype of action\u201d \nPLCAA was passed to prevent, and that the suit had \nto be \u201cimmediately\u201d dismissed. Pet.App.232a-33a. \nThe First Circuit reversed. It agreed with the \ndistrict court in rejecting Mexico\u2019s extraterritoriality \nargument. Id. 293a. But it agreed with Mexico\u2019s \nfallback argument that its claims could nevertheless \nproceed because they satisfied PLCAA\u2019s predicate \nexception. Id. 293a-94a. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nFirst \nCircuit \nheld \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 alleged longstanding business practices \nviolated the federal ban on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the \nunlawful sale of firearms by independent licensed \n\n \n12 \n \n \ndealers. The court acknowledged that, \u201cof course,\u201d \nMexico did \u201cnot allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Id. 305a. But it noted that \nPetitioners \u201ccan identify\u201d the downstream dealers \nthat \u201care responsible for the illegal sales\u201d of firearms \nthat end up in Mexico. Id. 301a. And it quoted this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Twitter that \u201ca secondary \ndefendant\u2019s role in an illicit enterprise can be so \nsystemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and \nabetting every wrongful act committed by that \nenterprise.\u201d Id. 306a (quoting Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n496). The court then held that Petitioners fit that \ndescription, because they \u201coperate at a systemic level, \nallegedly designing, marketing, and distributing their \nguns so that demand by the cartels continues to boost \nsales,\u201d making them complicit in dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales. Id.  \nThe First Circuit also held that the complaint \nsatisfied proximate cause because Petitioners\u2019 alleged \n\u201caiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses,\u201d \nand to incur related costs. Id. 311a. \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court dismissed six of the eight defendants for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. Dct.Dkt.220. This Court \nthen granted certiorari. Undeterred, Mexico moved \nthe district court for partial final judgment under \nRule 54(b) so it could appeal that personal-jurisdiction \nruling. That court, however, stayed proceedings to \nawait this Court\u2019s decision. Dct.Dkt.228. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. To qualify for PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct must be \u201ca \nproximate cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted injuries. \nHere, Mexico relies on an eight-step causal chain\u2014\npeppered by independent criminal actors and \nderivative sovereign harms\u2014to try to link the lawful \nproduction and sale of firearms within the United \nStates to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its \ndrug cartels. If this attenuated theory of liability \nsatisfies proximate cause, that term has no meaning. \nA. PLCAA incorporates the traditional principle \nthat proximate cause means direct cause. And a \ncausal chain is not direct when it is interrupted by an \nindependent act carried out by an independent \nactor\u2014much less multiple independent acts, and even \nless multiple crimes. Accordingly, the general rule is \nthat a company that makes or sells a lawful product \nis not a proximate cause of harms resulting from third \nparties\u2019 independent criminal misuse of that product, \nbecause that independent misuse is the direct cause\u2014\nnot the creation and distribution of the lawful product. \nB. Mexico\u2019s causal chain here is extraordinarily \nindirect. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, crime after crime, spanning an international \nborder, all to link Petitioners\u2019 conduct in this country \nto the mayhem south of the border. That stretches \nproximate cause far beyond anything this Court has \nseen. Indeed, if Mexico can establish proximate cause \nhere, it is impossible to see who cannot\u2014to the peril \nof virtually every industry. But the central function of \nproximate cause is to maintain the floodgates of \nliability. Mexico\u2019s lawsuit would bomb the levees. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nC. Mexico tries to salvage its complaint from its \nmany infirmities, but it cannot escape the attenuated \nnature of its suit. In the main, Mexico tries to cut a \nfew links from its causal chain by arguing that its \nrelevant starting point is not Petitioners\u2019 own \nconduct, but rather the unlawful sale of firearms by \ndownstream dealers. Yet that runs headlong into \nPLCAA\u2019s text, which expressly authorizes claims only \nwhen a firearm company\u2019s own \u201cviolation\u201d of the law \nproximately harmed the plaintiff. And here, that \nalleged violation is aiding and abetting\u2014not any later \noffense. \nBut even if Mexico were right\u2014and the causal \nchain began at unlawful sales by independent \ndealers\u2014it would still fall far short of satisfying \nproximate cause. Even on this framing, some of those \nsales would still have to get illegally smuggled into \nMexico by independent criminals, where some would \nthen illegally end up with the cartels, who then would \nuse some to commit crimes in Mexico, which then \nwould cause financial harms to Mexico\u2019s government. \nSo even on its preferred terms, Mexico\u2019s chain must be \ndragged across an international border and carried by \na cast of independent criminals committing a bevy of \nindependent crimes. However one cuts it, Mexico\u2019s \ntheory of causation is far too indirect. \nII. PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception also requires that \na firearms company violate a firearms-specific \nstatute. Here, Mexico says Petitioners\u2019 longstanding \nand strictly regulated business practices amount to \naiding and abetting every unlawful sale of their \nproducts \nby \nindependent \nfirearms \ndealers \ndownstream. That theory is as wrong as it sounds. \n\n \n15 \n \n \nA. Aiding-and-abetting liability requires culpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., some affirmative act taken for the \npurpose of assisting the commission of a crime. \nTypically, accomplice liability is tied to a specific \nunlawful act. In rare cases, one can be an accomplice \nto an unlawful criminal enterprise\u2014on the hook for \nall its misdoings. But for such sweeping liability to \nattach, the support must be pervasive and systemic. \nManufacturers and suppliers are not guilty of \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d downstream crimes when they \ndo nothing but make and sell lawful products in the \nordinary course. Every business knows its products \nmay be misused\u2014even criminally so\u2014by customers \ndownstream. But such knowledge has never been \nenough to generate criminal liability, lest the entire \neconomy grind to a halt. Instead, courts have long \nheld that businesses are not accomplices to the \ncriminal misuse of their products unless they take \nsome atypical action for the purpose of assisting a \ncrime. And no court has ever held that the routine \npractices of a lawful industry can constitute the kind \nof pervasive and systemic aid required for a business \nto be categorically liable for all its customers\u2019 crimes. \nB. Mexico has not unearthed a decades-long aiding-\nand-abetting scheme. To start, Mexico admits its suit \nis not tied to any specific unlawful sale\u2014for example, \nit does not allege that any Petitioner sold a particular \nfirearm knowing it would be unlawfully sold or \notherwise misused in some specific unlawful act. \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s theory is premised on Petitioners \nassisting unlawful firearm sellers writ large. Mexico \nthus must allege pervasive and systemic assistance on \nthe part of the firearms industry to substantiate its \naiding-and-abetting claim.  \n\n \n16 \n \n \nThis it cannot do. Mexico\u2019s suit rests on nothing but \nPetitioners\u2019 routine business practices. Indeed, that is \nthe whole point: It is a challenge to the industry\u2019s \nrefusal to go beyond what American firearms laws \nrequire, by adopting policies Mexico thinks would \nstem unlawful downstream sales. But failing to adopt \nmeasures to make others follow the law does not make \none complicit in their illegal actions. And where, as \nhere, a lawful industry simply continues to supply a \nlawful product in an ordinary manner, its decision to \nstay the course cannot turn it into an accomplice.  \nC. Mexico says that its case is different, because \nPetitioners know the identities of some downstream \nbad-actor dealers, and have chosen not to purge them \nfrom the supply chain. But that is just wrong: Again, \nthe complaint does not allege facts showing a single \nPetitioner has knowingly sold a single firearm to a \nsingle dealer actually engaged in illicit sales. But even \nif Petitioners did know the identity of some \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndealers \nwho \nsometimes made unlawful sales, failing to take \naffirmative steps to purge those dealers from \ndownstream supply chains would still not make \nPetitioners criminal accomplices\u2014just as failing to \ncut off college-town bars does not make a felon out of \nBudweiser, and failing to purge ISIS-related accounts \nwas not enough for liability in Twitter. When the \nmanufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply \nputs its product in the general stream of commerce, \nthe aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that \nbusiness with broadly policing every bad actor who \nmay pick up its products downstream. \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAMERICAN FIREARMS COMPANIES ARE NOT A \nPROXIMATE CAUSE OF MEXICO\u2019S INJURIES. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nmust show that a firearms company\u2019s illegal conduct \nwas \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of its alleged harms. 15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nMexico \nalleges \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States has led to violent cartel crime in \nMexico, ultimately resulting in a variety of costs borne \nby the Mexican government.  \nMexico\u2019s suit falls far short of what proximate cause \ndemands. Proximate cause means direct cause. And \nwhen a causal chain depends on independent acts \ndone by independent actors (let alone criminals), it is \nplainly indirect. The rule has thus long been that the \nmanufacturer or distributor of a lawful product is not \na proximate cause of the product\u2019s independent \ncriminal misuse. And PLCAA incorporated that rule \nfor the very purpose of barring suits like this one. \nA. Proximate Cause Means Direct Cause. \nThe essential demand of proximate cause is a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. \nCorp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). As Justice Holmes put \nit a century ago, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule has long been that \nproximate cause does not permit recovery for an \ninjury that is \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d of a causal chain. \nId. at 271 (quoting S. Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer \nCo., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918)). That traditional \nunderstanding controls under PLCAA. And since \nMexico\u2019s attenuated theory of injury is anything but \ndirect, it is squarely barred. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n1. Proximate cause distinguishes de facto from legal \ncausation. See Pac. Ops. Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, \n565 U.S. 207, 221-22 (2012). The law does not permit \na \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d for \u201cevery conceivable harm that \ncan be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n132 (2014). After all, illegal acts always \u201ccause ripples \nof harm [that] flow far beyond\u201d their immediate object. \nBank of America Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n202 (2017). But liability has never followed \u201cwherever \nthose ripples travel.\u201d Id.; see Waters v. Merchants\u2019 \nLouisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837). As Justice \nScalia colorfully put it, \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost,\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nFrom many de facto causes, only proximate ones \ncount. And only \u201cdirect\u201d causes are proximate. \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268; Babbitt v. Sweet Home \nChapter of Cmtys. for a Great Or., 515 U.S. 687, 732 \n(1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting); 1 Thomas M. Cooley, A \nTreatise on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 108 (4th ed. 1932).  \nIn policing the line between direct and indirect \nharm, this Court has emphasized that \u201cforeseeability \nalone does not ensure the close connection that \nproximate cause requires.\u201d Bank of America, 581 U.S. \nat 202; Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. \n1, 12 (2010). \u201cIf one takes a broad enough view, all \nconsequences of a negligent act, no matter how far \nremoved in time or space, may be foreseen. \nConditioning liability on foreseeability, therefore, is \nhardly a condition at all.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. \nGottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 552-53 (1994). \n\n \n19 \n \n \nRather, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule is that a direct cause is \nlimited to the \u201cfirst step\u201d in a causal chain. Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 139-40. If multiple steps stand in between \nthe conduct and the harm, then the connection \nbecomes too \u201cremote,\u201d \u201ccontingent,\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d to \nsatisfy basic proximate cause. Hemi, 559 U.S. at 9-10.  \n2. The \u201ccentral question\u201d is thus \u201cwhether the \nalleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjuries.\u201d Anza v. Ideal Basic Steel Supply Corp., 547 \nU.S. 451, 461 (2006). Where the causal chain rests on \nindependent acts, the answer is almost always no. See \nAssoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State \nCouncil of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 532 n.25 (1983). \nIntuitively so. Something is \u201cdirect\u201d when it is \nuninterrupted; and it is \u201cindirect\u201d when \u201cother, \nindependent, factors\u201d punctuate the chain. Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 268-69. So when a causal chain involves \n\u201cseparate actions carried out by separate parties,\u201d it \nlacks continuity, and is thus typically deficient. Hemi, \n559 U.S. at 11; see Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 541 n.46. \nTo be sure, proximate cause sometimes allows for \nmulti-link chains where those links are uninterrupted \nby independent action. A good example is the Lanham \nAct, which allows a company to sue another for false \nadvertisements, which cause reduced sales due to \n\u201cconsumers who are deceived by the advertising.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. Proximate cause is still met \nbecause there is no discontinuity in the chain\u2014i.e., \nthere is no independent intervening act separating the \nunlawful act from the victim\u2019s harms, since no \nconsumer freely chooses to be deceived. Cf. id. at 139-\n40; see Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. \n639, 658 (2008) (\u201cno independent factors\u201d in chain).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nBut absent such direct connections, proximate \ncause does not allow multi-step chains. \u201cA proximate \ncause of an injury is one which, in a natural and \ncontinuous \nsequence, \nwithout \nany \nefficient \nintervening cause, produces the injury.\u201d Dobbs, The \nLaw of Torts \u00a7 201 (2d ed. 2024). The chain must \n\u201cconstitute a continuous succession of events, so \nlinked together as to make a natural whole,\u201d free of \nany \u201cnew and independent cause intervening between \nthe wrong and the injury.\u201d Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 475 (1876). \n3. There is no doubt this traditional rule controls \nunder PLCAA. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (the \n\u201c[p]roximate-cause analysis\u201d is shaped by the \u201cnature\u201d \nof the statutory scheme at issue). Congress believed \nthe problem with the suits being filed by U.S. cities \nand others was that they all rested on remote causal \nchains that were too indirect to satisfy proximate \ncause. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7). And it sought to adopt \nthe \n\u201ccommon-sense \ntraditional \nrule \n[] \nthat \nmanufacturers and sellers should not be held liable \nfor the criminal or unlawful misuse of their products.\u201d \nHouse Report, at 6-17; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1). \nIn PLCAA\u2019s text, Congress thus made proximate \ncause an express requirement. For a manufacturer or \nseller to be sued, it must have committed a \u201cviolation\u201d \nthat is \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the alleged harm. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). When Congress uses a \ncommon-law term in a statute, it \u201cbrings the old soil \nwith it.\u201d Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 733 \n(2013). And with PLCAA, the whole idea was to use \nthis old soil to build up barriers against excessive \nliability. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nAccordingly, Congress made proximate cause a \nthreshold demand of federal law, in order to stop the \n\u201cexpansion of liability\u201d by novel state-law tort suits. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7); see id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), \n(a)(8). For any claim to advance, Congress made sure \nit would first have to satisfy the traditional standard \nfor proximate cause as codified in federal law. Cf. \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 132 (collecting laws where this \nstandard applies). Entrenching this fixed standard in \nfederal law provides a bulwark against creative \ninnovations by state courts, and ensures that liability \nremains limited to cases of direct causation, as it has \nfor \u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). \nTo the extent there is any doubt about how this \napplies in practice, recall Congress passed PLCAA not \nas a prophylactic measure, but as a response to real \nsuits (quite similar to this one). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(b) \n(requiring existing suits be dismissed). And Congress \nspecifically called out those that \u201cbr[o]ke from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose[d] firearm \nmanufacturers to unprecedented and unlimited \nliability\u201d\u2014suits that pressed near-identical claims as \nthose here (but absent the further step of spanning an \ninternational border). House Report, at 11-12 & n.48. \nOn the flipside, Congress also collected cases where \ncourts properly applied proximate cause. Id. at 6-10 \n(citing City of Philadelphia v. Beretta, 126 F. Supp. 2d \n882 (E.D. Pa. 2000)). In sum, Congress agreed that \n\u201cthe relationship between a tortious act and actual \ninjury historically must be direct, not remote\u201d\u2014and \npassed PLCAA so that this traditional rule would \ngovern as a matter of federal law. House Report, at \n13-14 (relying on Holmes). \n\n \n22 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Injuries Are Indirect. \nMexico\u2019s suit is far more attenuated than the suits \nthat prompted PLCAA in the first place, and does not \ncome close to satisfying traditional proximate cause. \n1. The sheer number of links in Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain is more than enough to defeat proximate cause. \na. Mexico\u2019s causal chain has eight links, punctuated \nby independent acts done by independent actors. To \nrecap: (1) Federally licensed manufacturers sell \nfirearms to federally licensed wholesalers; (2) those \nwholesalers sell to federally licensed dealers; (3) a \nfraction of those dealers engage in unlawful sales; (4) \na fraction of those illegally sold firearms are trafficked \ninto Mexico; (5) a fraction of those trafficked firearms \nend up with the cartels; (6) a fraction of those firearms \nare used by the cartels for crimes; (7) a fraction of \nthose crimes injure people and property in Mexico; \nand (8) Mexico\u2019s government then spends funds to \nrespond to the fallout, causing it fiscal injuries. \nMexico does not deny this causal chain involves the \nfree choices of many third parties: dealers, straw \npurchasers, \ntraffickers, \nsmugglers, \nand \ncartel \nmembers. Mexico also does not allege that any \nPetitioner controls, directs, or coordinates the conduct \nof these third parties. Instead, on Mexico\u2019s own \naccount, all of these choices\u2014the selling, buying, \ntrafficking, \ncrime, \nand \nmore\u2014are \npurely \nthe \nindependent choices of independent actors. \nThis Court has \u201cnever before stretched the causal \nchain\u201d to cover such independent action\u2014and has \nindeed rejected far more modest attempts to do so. See \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11. For instance, in Hemi, New York \nCity tried to bring a RICO suit against an out-of-state \n\n \n23 \n \n \ncigarette seller. Its theory: The seller failed to send \nreports to the state about those it had shipped to (as \nrequired by federal law), which later impaired the \ncity\u2019s ability to collect the taxes it levied on the \npossession of cigarettes, costing it revenue. Id. at 5-6. \nThis Court held that proximate cause was lacking. \nCritically, the \u201cconduct directly causing the harm\u201d\u2014\nthe nonpayment of taxes\u2014\u201cwas distinct from the \n[company\u2019s] conduct\u201d\u2014its failure to transmit certain \nreports. Id. at 11. And in between, \u201cthe City\u2019s theory \nof liability rest[ed] not just on separate actions, but \nseparate actions carried out by separate parties.\u201d Id. \nThat did not work: Since the \u201cCity\u2019s theory of liability \nrest[ed] on the independent actions of third and even \nfourth parties,\u201d it was far too attenuated. Id. at 15; see \nAnza, 547 U.S. at 458-61; Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 542. \nBank of America offers an instructive roadmap too. \nThere, Miami sued two national banks for allegedly \nissuing worse mortgages to certain minority groups, \nwhich prompted greater defaults and foreclosures, \nwhich decreased property values, which all ultimately \nresulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes \nto the city\u2019s government. 581 U.S. at 193-94. \nThe Court reserved the proximate cause question, \nbut Justice Thomas (along with Justices Kennedy and \nAlito) answered it with a resounding no. Miami\u2019s mere \nfour-step chain was \u201cexceedingly attenuated.\u201d 581 \nU.S. at 212 (Thomas, J., concurring and dissenting in \npart). It was riddled by \u201cindependent events,\u201d distinct \nfrom the defendants\u2019 conduct. Id. And those \nindependent acts made Miami\u2019s financial injuries \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d for proximate cause. Id. at 213. \n\n \n24 \n \n \nApplying the same principles, lower courts \nconsistently rejected this type of suit even before \nPLCAA. Cert. Petn. 15-18. Most notably, the Third \nCircuit rejected a suit by Philadelphia alleging that \nthe same longstanding practices by the firearms \nindustry \u201ccreate[ed] and contribut[ed] to [the] \ncriminal use\u201d of firearms in that city. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n419 (3d Cir. 2002). The court dismissed, holding the \ncausal chain \u201cfrom the manufacturer to Philadelphia \nstreets\u201d was too \u201clong and tortuous.\u201d Id. at 423. \nThis is a simple case under these precedents. \nMexico\u2019s eight-step causal chain is more attenuated \nthan anything this Court has seen. See Hemi, 559 U.S. \nat 11. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, spanning an international border to boot. And \nevery injury alleged here is the result of one of those \ndistinct actions against a foreign sovereign in a \nforeign land. Each such act alone is enough to sever \nthe causal chain; together, they shatter it. \nb. All the more so, because many of those acts are \ncrimes. Again, the purpose of proximate cause is to \nassign \u201cresponsibility\u201d among possible liable actors. \nDobbs, supra, at \u00a7 198. And when an injury is the \nresult of an independent criminal act, the law assigns \nresponsibility to the criminal\u2014not an upstream party \nwith no control over him. Id. \u00a7 209; see Restatement \n(Second) Torts \u00a7 302B cmts. d-e. Thus, when a causal \nchain relies on an independent criminal act\u2014let alone \nmultiple ones\u2014it virtually never satisfies proximate \ncause. See Hemi, 559 U.S. at 11 (emphasizing how \nintervening cause involved a breach of \u201clegal[] \nobligat[ion]\u201d); see also, e.g., Kemper v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 911 F.3d 383, 393 (7th Cir. 2018). \n\n \n25 \n \n \nTo be sure, this common law rule has some narrow \nexceptions. When there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d\u2014\ne.g., bailor-bailee, caregiver-child, landlord-tenant\u2014\nthen a party may be liable for harms caused by a third \nparty. See Dobbs, supra, at \u00a7 209. The rationale is that \nwhen a party owes a legal \u201cduty\u201d to another to protect \nit against certain harms (which may include criminal \nacts), proximate cause should not stand in the way of \nliability\u2014and must excuse an otherwise intervening \nact. Id.; see, e.g., Moon v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Benson, \n135 A. 114, 115 (Pa. 1926) (bailor who placed property \nin insufficiently secure place liable after thief stole it). \nBut there is zero \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between \nfirearms companies and sovereigns\u2014let alone foreign \nsovereigns\u2014that obligates the companies to protect \nthem from third-party crimes. District of Columbia v. \nBeretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 640-41 (D.C. \n2005). \u201c[G]un manufacturers are under no legal duty \nto protect citizens from the deliberate and unlawful \nuse of their products.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425; \nsee House Report, at 7-9. Rightly so: As in any \nindustry, there is no duty for a manufacturer or seller \nof a lawful product to protect others from its criminal \nmisuse. E.g., Stahlecker v. Ford Motor Co., 667 \nN.W.2d 244, 254-57 (Neb. 2003). \nPut together, then, the general rule is clear: The \nmanufacturer or seller of a lawful product is not a \nproximate cause of its independent criminal misuse. \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1136-37 (Ill. 2004); see District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 650-51. Absent some special relationship or \nlegal duty, an independent criminal act breaks the \ncausal chain. The responsible party is the criminal \nwho inflicts the harm\u2014not anyone else. \n\n \n26 \n \n \nThese principles doom Mexico\u2019s theory of causation. \nMexico depends on a legion of third-party criminals: \nBad-actor dealers; illicit buyers; gun traffickers; \nsmugglers; cartel members; etc. Mexico cannot even \nallege the actual number of such actors involved. And \nonce more, Mexico does not allege any Petitioner has \nany control, direction, or relation to these unknown \nand unknowable third parties. Instead, Mexico relies \non crime after crime\u2014by independent criminal after \nindependent criminal\u2014to try to connect Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct to Mexico\u2019s harms. That does not work.  \n2. This Court has also looked to other factors to see \nif a causal chain is too indirect. All cut the same way. \na. One sign that a causal chain is too attenuated is \nthat ascertaining damages and liability would be \nunworkable. Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-60. After all, \u201cthe \nless direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to \nascertain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages \nattributable to the violation, as distinct from other, \nindependent, factors.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269. When \na downstream injury is the product of multiple \nintertwined factors, that is a telltale sign of \nindirectness. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135, 140. \nThat is this case in spades. Mexico marshals a \nparade of bad actors\u2014dealers, smugglers, cartels\u2014\nwho drive the bedlam south of the border. But there is \nno way to apportion fault among them, or to isolate \nthe causal role Petitioners play. Mexico admits the \nvast majority of firearm sales in the United States are \nlawful; that most firearms recovered in Mexico were \nnot made or sold by Petitioners; and that Mexico is \nswamped by other firearms from other companies. \nPet.App.44a, 158a-59a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n27 \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the nature of \nMexico\u2019s alleged injuries. Mexico\u2019s principal injuries \nare higher governmental expenditures\u2014on security, \nhealthcare, social services, and the like. BIO 6, 20-21. \nTo determine damages, a court would need to go line-\nby-line through Mexico\u2019s federal budget and assess for \nitself which spending increases are attributable to \nPetitioners, versus the countless other causes that can \ndrive governmental spending in Mexico. That is not \nthe stuff of judicial competency. But it is a flashing \nindicator of a woefully indirect theory of liability. \nb. Another consideration is whether the alleged \ninjuries are direct or derivative. If derivative, there \nare typically \u201cbetter situated plaintiffs\u201d (direct \nvictims) who can bring more appropriate litigation to \naddress any allegedly wrongful action by a defendant. \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11-12; Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70. \nAnd that is clearly the case here: Victims in Mexico \ncan sue the criminals in Mexico who have actually \ninjured them. That is what U.S. courts have said when \nU.S. cities filed analogous suits. Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425. And it is the basic policy judgment \nCongress made in PLCAA. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  \nBy contrast, most if not all of Mexico\u2019s alleged \nharms derive from violence visited on its citizens. But \nthis Court has repeatedly held an \u201calleged harm\u201d is \n\u201cordinarily\u201d too attenuated \u201cif the harm is purely \nderivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person \nby the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. \nThat makes good sense: By definition, a derivative \nharm is (at least) one step removed, making it \nindirect. \n\n \n28 \n \n \nTo that end, the reason a derivative harm flunks \nproximate cause is not because it is unforeseeable. \nDerivative injuries are often predictable. For example, \nit is easy to foresee that shuttering a business through \nillegal action (e.g., extortion) will harm its landlord, \nwho will lose the business\u2019s rent. But it is nevertheless \nblack-letter law that the landlord\u2019s injuries are too far \nremoved to count\u2014lest our tort system become one of \nunlimited liability. See Apple v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273, \n291 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nOn Mexico\u2019s view, however, it is hard to see who \ncannot recover. There are plenty of people who suffer \nfollow-on harms from the cartels, including in ways \nmore direct than Mexico\u2014companies lose employees, \nbusinesses lose customers, and yes, landlords lose \nrent. But there is no sound argument that any of those \nparties can come close to satisfying proximate cause. \nSee Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 212-13 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part). And there is no \nreason why the Mexican government is any different. \nC. Mexico\u2019s Contrary Arguments Fail. \nIn opposing certiorari, Mexico barely defended the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s proximate-cause analysis, which \nimproperly \nconflated \nproximate \ncause \nand \nforeseeability. See Pet.App.309a-19a. Instead, Mexico \nraised three main arguments to try to salvage its \ncomplaint \nfrom \nits \nobvious \nproximate-cause \ninfirmities. None persuade. \nFirst, Mexico argues that the relevant criminal \n\u201cviolation\u201d that starts the causal chain is not \nPetitioners\u2019 own conduct, but the \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d involving their products. BIO 15, 22. That is \nwrong. By its terms, PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception \n\n \n29 \n \n \nallows claims \u201cin which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of \nthe product, and the violation was a proximate cause \nof the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). This makes clear \nthat \u201cthe\u201d relevant \u201cviolation\u201d is the one committed by \nthe \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d being sued\u2014and that \nviolation must be the proximate cause of the injury.  \nHere, Mexico claims that Petitioners violated the \naiding-and-abetting statute. For purposes of the \npredicate exception, the analysis thus turns on \nwhether Petitioners\u2019 alleged violative conduct\u2014i.e., \ntheir routine production and sale of firearms in this \ncountry (which are later resold by bad-actor dealers \nand others)\u2014is a proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s alleged \ninjuries. And as detailed above, the answer is no. \nIn any event, even if the causal chain starts with \nunlawful sales by dealers, those violations still are not \na proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s diffuse harms. Indeed, \nnumerous independent crimes continue to stand \nbetween any unlawful sales in America and Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries abroad: A fraction of those sales must \nfirst be illegally smuggled into Mexico (versus used for \nany other purpose in America); then a fraction of those \nillegally smuggled firearms must be illegally given to \ncartels (versus other users); then a fraction of those \nfirearms must be used to commit violent crimes \n(versus other ends); and then Mexico must choose how \nto spend funds in response, incurring fiscal harms. \nIn short, even on its preferred framing, Mexico\u2019s \ncausal chain still stretches across an international \nborder and is punctuated by multiple independent \n\n \n30 \n \n \ncriminal acts carried out by a series of independent \ncriminals, leading to follow-on injuries suffered by a \nforeign sovereign. No case has ever found proximate \ncause on such a remote chain of events. \nSecond, Mexico insists its multi-link chain should \nbe excused because Petitioners\u2019 conduct is \u201cintegral\u201d \nto the cartels\u2019 activity. BIO 22-23. But that conflates \nde facto causation (the fact that Petitioners are \nindirect suppliers) with proximate causation (whether \nthey are directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s derivative \ninjuries due to cartel violence). As discussed, this \nCourt has allowed multi-link chains only where there \nis no \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d rendering them \u201cindirect.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 140. So in Lexmark, this Court \nallowed a direct competitor of the defendant to sue for \nfalse advertisements that caused it to \u201cautomatically\u201d \nsuffer a loss in sales. Id.; see also Bridge 553 U.S. at \n647-48 (allowing a similar \u201cstraightforward\u201d theory). \nBut as this Court has explained, the defining trait \nin those \u201crelatively unique circumstances,\u201d Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 140, was the absence of any \u201cindependent \nactions\u201d that would break the causal chain, Hemi, 559 \nU.S. at 15. Here, by contrast, Mexico\u2019s theory is \nsaturated with such independent links. \nThird, Mexico says that PLCAA demands a looser \nversion of proximate cause, because Congress wanted \nsome plaintiffs to be able \u201cto recover for harms caused \nin part by third-party conduct.\u201d BIO 23. But as \nexplained, watering down proximate cause was quite \nliterally the opposite of what Congress sought to do \nwith PLCAA. And in portraying Petitioners\u2019 position \nas foreclosing all potential liability, Mexico shoots at \na strawman. Nobody is saying PLCAA cuts off liability \n\n \n31 \n \n \nfor a company engaged in coordinated criminal \nactivity: If a convicted felon comes into a firearm store \nasking for the best firearm to rob a bank, and the \nseller recommends and furnishes one to assist in the \nrobbery, \nthen \nthat \nthird-party \ncrime \nis \nnot \nindependent from the seller. The seller is criminally \nliable for participating in the crime and is on the hook \nfor \nthe \ndirect \nconsequences. \nSee \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). By contrast, \nMexico\u2019s \nalleged \ncausal \nchain \nhere \ninvolves \nindependent criminal activity in which Petitioners \nplayed no role. And that sort of conduct is what defeats \nproximate cause. Indeed, the purpose of PLCAA\u2014and \nthe reason it expressly added a proximate-cause \nrequirement\u2014was to ensure the industry would not \nbe held liable for the independent crimes of third \nparties. But that is exactly what Mexico is trying to \naccomplish here. \nII. PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF AIDING AND \nABETTING ANY FIREARMS CRIME. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nalso must show that the defendant committed a \n\u201cviolation\u201d of a firearm-specific statute. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nFor \nthis, \nMexico \nclaims \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices violate the \nfederal criminal ban on aiding and abetting illicit \nfirearm sales by downstream dealers. BIO 27. \nImportantly, Mexico does not argue that any \nPetitioner has itself broken any American law, rule, \nor regulation specifically governing the manufacture \nor sale of firearms. Nor does Mexico allege that any \nPetitioner is even \u201caware\u201d of any \u201cparticular unlawful \nsale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Rather, Mexico maintains that \n\n \n32 \n \n \nPetitioners are accomplices to downstream dealers \nwho choose to sell their firearms illegally, because \nPetitioners are generally aware that some dealers will \nengage in such sales, and Petitioners have failed to go \nbeyond what the American firearms laws require in \norder to counteract those third-party criminal acts. \nThat is not aiding and abetting. A business that \ndoes nothing more than make or sell a product in the \nordinary course is not an accomplice to downstream \nactors who later sell or misuse that product illegally. \nAnd the supplier of a lawful product does not become \na criminal simply because it refuses to take additional \naffirmative steps to stop third parties from using the \nproduct to commit a crime. This Court reaffirmed that \nlongstanding rule in Twitter, and it settles this case. \nA. Aiding and Abetting Requires Culpable \nMisconduct, Not Business As Usual. \nAiding \nand \nabetting \nrequires \nculpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., something done for the purpose of \nassisting a criminal offense. But where a business \ndoes nothing more than engage in routine business \npractices\u2014like broadly putting a good to market, or \noffering a general service\u2014it does not become an \naccomplice to independent downstream criminals who \nlater misuse that product, even if the business is \naware such criminal misuse is possible. Something \nmore is needed, lest every industry become liable as \nan accomplice to the misdeeds of its customers\u2014\npunishable by felony. \n1. Aiding and abetting \u201creflects a centuries-old view \nof culpability: that a person may be responsible for a \ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps \nanother to complete its commission.\u201d Rosemond v. \n\n \n33 \n \n \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 65, 70 (2014). Federal law \nincorporates that view, making accomplices and \nprincipals equally \u201cpunishable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). \nAiding and abetting has both an objective and a \nsubjective component. An accomplice must take some \n\u201caffirmative act\u201d to assist a criminal offense, and also \ndo so with the \u201cintent of facilitating the offense\u2019s \ncommission.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. Together, \naiding-and-abetting law requires \u201cthat a defendant \u2018in \nsome sort associate himself with the venture, that he \nparticipate in it as in something that he wishes to \nbring about, that he seek by his action to make it \nsucceed.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d \n401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938) (Hand, J.)). \nBut the doctrine has strict limits. As for the \nobjective component, \u201cthe concept of \u2018helping\u2019 in the \ncommission of a crime . . . has never been boundless.\u201d \nId. at 488. The law has long distinguished between \nthose who \u201cincidentally facilitate a criminal venture\u201d \nand those who \u201cactively participate in it.\u201d Rosemond, \n572 U.S. at 77 n.8. Thus, \u201cgenerally\u201d\u2014absent some \nlegal duty displacing the ordinary rule\u2014the law \u201cdoes \nnot impose liability for mere omissions, inactions, or \nnonfeasance.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Rather, the \n\u201cconceptual core\u201d of aiding-and-abetting liability is \n\u201cconscious[] and culpable participa[tion].\u201d Id. at 493. \nAs for its subjective component, aiding and abetting \nhas also differentiated awareness from intent. The \n\u201cmere knowledge\u201d that one\u2019s actions may assist a \ncriminal scheme is insufficient. Direct Sales Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 703, 711 (1943). A criminal \naccomplice must act with the intent of assisting a \ncriminal offense. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. \n\n \n34 \n \n \n2. The type of support required also turns on the \ntheory of liability. \u201c[A]iding and abetting is inherently \na rule of secondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). Thus, the \nheartland case involves intentional aid to a specific \ncrime\u2014a particular, identified wrong. Id. \nIn rare circumstances, a \u201csecondary defendant\u2019s \nrole in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the \nsecondary defendant is aiding and abetting every \nwrongful act committed by that enterprise.\u201d Id. at 496; \nsee Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 488 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But because this theory of liability effectively \n\u201cblur[s]\u201d the line between \u201cconspiracy liability\u201d and \n\u201caiding-and-abetting liability,\u201d it requires a markedly \ngreater showing. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496. To be on the \nhook for everything an illicit enterprise does, a \ndefendant must provide such \u201cpervasive, systemic, \nand culpable assistance,\u201d to infer a \u201cnear-common \nenterprise\u201d with the primary criminal(s). Id. at 502. \n3. The limits on aiding and abetting are especially \nimportant when it comes to manufacturers and \nsuppliers of lawful goods. After all, almost every \nbusiness knows its products may be misused\u2014\nincluding by criminals: Beer companies know drinks \nwill be sold to minors; car companies know their \nvehicles will be driven recklessly; and pharmaceutical \ncompanies know their medicines will be abused. \nBut \u201caiding-and-abetting liability\u201d has never been \nextended so \u201cfar\u201d as to make \u201cordinary merchants . . . \nliable for [the] misuse of their goods and services.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Courts have regularly held \nthat making or selling a lawful product\u2014even when \naware it may be criminally misused\u2014is not sufficient. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nId. at 488, 501 & n.14. As the United States recently \nput it: Liability does not naturally attach where \u201ca \ndefendant provided only routine business services in \nan ordinary manner, was remote from the unlawful \nact that injured the plaintiff, or is accused of aiding \nand abetting another\u2019s conduct through inaction.\u201d \nAmicus Curiae Brief for the United States, 11-12, \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (No. 21-1496). \nTo prevent a pall of prosecution being draped over \nthe economy, courts have long drawn an objective line, \ndifferentiating lawful businesses that engage in \n\u201croutine\u201d conduct from those that engage in \u201catypical\u201d \nconduct to help a crime succeed. Camp v. Dema, 948 \nF.2d 455, 459 (8th Cir. 1991) (cited by Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 490-92). Only the latter is the sort of culpable \nmisconduct that establishes accomplice liability. If a \nmerchant is engaged \u201cin the ordinary course of his \nbusiness,\u201d it is not enough that he has a \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d that his products may facilitate crimes \ndownstream. Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522 \nF.2d 84, 95 (5th Cir. 1975) (cited by Twitter, 598 U.S. \nat 491). Maintaining \u201croutine\u201d business practices is \nthe sort of \u201cpassive\u201d inaction that is treated as \ninnocent rather than innately \u201cculpable\u201d; a business \nmust break from the norm to become guilty as an \naccomplice. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 491.1 \n \n1 See, e.g., Amazon Servs. LLC v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., 109 \nF.4th 573, 581-83 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (providing \u201cgenerally \navailable\u201d service in \u201croutine\u201d manner insufficient for liability); \nUnited States v. Blankenship, 970 F.2d 283, 286-89 (7th Cir. \n1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (noting where \u201c\u2018mere\u2019 sale[s]\u201d end and \nliability \u201cbegin[s]\u201d); SEC v. Wash. Cnty. Util. Dist., 676 F.2d 218, \n226 (6th Cir. 1982) (contrasting \u201ca transaction in the ordinary \ncourse of his business\u201d and one \u201cof an extraordinary nature\u201d). \n\n \n36 \n \n \nAccordingly, when a business puts a lawful good to \nmarket, it does not become an accomplice to that \nproduct\u2019s downstream criminal misuse simply by \ndeclining to take additional affirmative steps to \ncounteract that independent unlawful action. That is, \nto incur liability, it is not enough that a company \nchooses to stay the course and continue routine \npractices; it must engage in some objectively unusual \naction, directed to actually making the crime succeed. \nThat is already a high bar. But the bar gets even \nhigher if the theory of liability is pegged not to aiding \na specific unlawful act (e.g., an illicit sale), but instead \nan unlawful enterprise (e.g., an illicit seller). For this \ntype of enterprise theory, a merchant must go even \nfurther, taking atypical steps in such a systemic and \npervasive fashion that it is jointly liable for all of that \nenterprise\u2019s misdoings. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496, 502; \nsee Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487-88. And for that sort \nof categorical liability to attach, the routine practices \nof a lawful industry\u2014untailored to any buyer, \nunparticularized to any transaction\u2014are never \nenough. Such overwhelming assistance must be \ntargeted and deliberate; supplying a lawful product in \na general and ordinary manner is not that. Mexico has \nnever cited any case holding otherwise. Nor could it. \n4. This Court\u2019s decision in Direct Sales Company \nillustrates these principles. That case involved a \ndistributor that directly sold an obscenely large \namount of morphine to a single rural doctor, who was \nobviously engaged in a criminal enterprise by re-\nselling the drugs illegally. 319 U.S. at 705. The \ndistributor was charged with conspiring to violate the \nfederal narcotics laws, and this Court affirmed the \nconviction. Id. at 714-15. \n\n \n37 \n \n \nIn so doing, this Court took pains to distinguish \nroutine versus atypical business activity. It stressed \nthat for liability to attach, it is not enough for a \nbusiness to be aware that its product will be misused: \nThere must be \u201cmore than knowledge, acquiescence, \ncarelessness, indifference, lack of concern.\u201d Id. at 713. \nWhen there is \u201cnothing more on the seller\u2019s part than \nindifference to the buyer\u2019s illegal purpose and passive \nacquiescence in his desire to purchase,\u201d that cannot be \nfodder for a felony. Id. at 712 n.8. \nThe reason the Direct Sales Company could be \ncriminally liable was it strayed far beyond business as \nusual. The distributor sold the doctor such massive \nand atypical amounts of morphine\u2014around 36,000 \npills a year, when the average was about 400\u2014that \nthere was no conceivable lawful explanation for what \nwas going on. See id. at 705-06. The distributor, \nmoreover, also took other affirmative steps to bolster \nhis complicity, like coordinating with the doctor as to \nhow to avoid law enforcement, such as by changing \ntablet sizes. Id. at 707. All told, this sort of obvious, \nprolonged, and direct \u201ccooperation\u201d with a specific \ndrug dealer was more than enough to sustain a \nconviction. Id. at 713. And as this Court has since \nexplained, Direct Sales stands for the proposition that \naccomplice liability attaches when a \u201cprovider of \nroutine services does so in an unusual way.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 502. \nRightly so. Again, the touchstone for aiding and \nabetting is to culpably \u201cparticipate\u201d in a wrongful act \nso as to help \u201cmake it succeed.\u201d Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949). In determining \nwhether an ordinary merchant has crossed that line, \nit makes sense to insist on unusual and particularized \n\n \n38 \n \n \nbehavior to distinguish incidental facilitation from \naffirmative \nsupport. \nAbsent \nthis \nobjective \nrequirement, all-too-easy allegations of scienter would \nimperil every business that sells a lawful product that \nis predictably abused by criminals. By contrast, where \nthe merchant is not engaged in business as usual, that \nidentifiable break from the norm can furnish the \nmisconduct needed for liability. Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 487-88 (attributing liability to defendant providing \nservices \u201cin an unusual way under unusual \ncircumstances for a long period of time\u201d). \n5. PLCAA incorporates these basic limits on aiding \nand abetting. After all, when the Act was passed, it \nwas \ncommon \nknowledge \nthat \ncriminals \ncould \npurchase firearms from some bad-actor dealers\u2014\nindeed, that was the very premise of the lawsuits \nPLCAA was passed to stop. \nIt was Congress\u2019s judgment, however, that so long \nas manufacturers and sellers followed the many \nfederal, state, and local regulations that directly apply \nto making and selling firearms, they \u201cshould not[] be \n[held] liable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse [their] products.\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). There was not a whisper in \nCongress that the same type of plaintiffs could bring \nthe same type of suits, just by restyling the same type \nof tort allegations in aiding-and-abetting garb. See \nsupra pp. 6-7. \nThe opposite. Congress condemned the \u201cslippery \nslope\u201d these novel suits promised\u2014i.e., the legal, \nsocial, and economic chaos that would follow from \nimposing \n\u201cliability\u201d \non \nevery \n\u201ccompany \n[that] \nmanufactures a legitimate product that is widely and \n\n \n39 \n \n \nlawfully distributed,\u201d who knows that its product may \nbe \u201ccriminally or unlawfully misused\u201d downstream. \nHouse Report, at 23. Countless industries \u201care aware \nthat a small percentage of their products will be \nmisused by criminals.\u201d Id. at 24. But that has never \nbeen enough for liability of any stripe\u2014let alone \ncriminal liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7), (a)(8). \nThese points bear out in PLCAA\u2019s text and \nstructure. \nFor \ninstance, \nwithin \nthe \npredicate \nexception, the Act provides an example of how a \nsupplier might be liable for aiding and abetting, but \nonly in the context of a particular transaction where \nthe supplier knows that \u201cthe actual buyer\u201d of \u201cthe\u201d \nfirearm \nis \nbarred \nfrom \nhaving \nit. \nId. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(II). Likewise, PLCAA includes a \nseparate exception allowing transferors to be sued if \nthey are convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(h), \nwhich prohibits giving someone a firearm \u201cknowing or \nhaving reasonable cause to believe that [it] will be \nused to commit a felony.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i). \nThis all reflects the narrow range of suits that \nCongress contemplated: Instances where a firearm \nsupplier knowingly makes an illegal sale to a specific \ncriminal\u2014i.e., where a business engages in atypical \nconduct to assist a particular criminal offense. By \ncontrast, nothing in PLCAA reflects the sort of \nsystemic liability contemplated here, where the \nroutine business practices of manufacturers and \ndistributors would make them responsible for an \nentire class of criminal action. Indeed, if simply \nshowing that a firearms company was aware that a \nsmall fraction of its products would fall into the hands \nof criminals was enough, then the particularized \nprovisions above would be meaningless. \n\n \n40 \n \n \nB. Mexico \nTargets \nOrdinary \nBusiness \nPractices, Not Culpable Misconduct. \nOver the course of this litigation, Mexico has offered \nshifting theories of aiding and abetting. Its complaint \nalleged that Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \u201cdrug cartels.\u201d \nPet.App.12a (\u00b6 15). But in this Court, Mexico has \npressed only the alternative theory embraced by the \nFirst Circuit: Petitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices \nare illegal because they aid and abet unlawful firearm \nsales by downstream independent dealers. BIO 27.  \n1. At the outset, it is important to identify the type \nof liability theory on which Mexico relies. As the First \nCircuit recognized, \u201cthe complaint does not allege \ndefendants\u2019 awareness of any particular unlawful \nsale,\u201d much less that Petitioners did anything to help \nany specific illicit transaction succeed. Pet.App.305a. \nMexico\u2019s case thus falls far outside the heartland of \naiding and abetting, which again is \u201ca rule of \nsecondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s claim is that Petitioners provide \nsuch pervasive support to bad-actor dealers that \nPetitioners are responsible for all of their unlawful \nsales of Petitioners\u2019 products. This is the theory the \nFirst Circuit relied on: Petitioners \u201coperate at a \nsystemic level, allegedly designing, marketing, and \ndistributing their guns so that demand by the cartels \ncontinues to boost sales,\u201d making them accomplices \neven though they do \u201cnot know about any particular \nunlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.306a. Mexico has now \nadopted this theory. BIO 17, 20, 22-25, 27-28. \n\n \n41 \n \n \n2. To establish such categorical liability, Mexico \nmust allege that Petitioners have provided \u201cpervasive, \nsystemic, and culpable\u201d assistance to the bad-actor \ndealers in the supply chain, for the specific purpose of \naiding their illicit sales. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 502. \nCritically, however, Mexico tries to get over this \nhigh bar with nothing but the routine \u201cbusiness \npractices\u201d Petitioners have followed \u201c[f]or decades.\u201d \nPet.App.139a (\u00b6 376). Mexico concedes that these \npractices \noverwhelmingly \ncater \nto \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). It nevertheless faults \nPetitioners for staying the course because, in its view, \nthey should have taken extralegal steps to better \ncurtail the small fraction of U.S. firearms that end up \nin Mexico. E.g., id. 12a (\u00b6 16), 24a (\u00b6 50). \nIn particular, Mexico\u2019s complaint focuses on three \nbroad \ncategories\u2014design, \nmarketing, \nand \ndistribution. It blames Petitioners for either not \naffirmatively adopting new policies to counteract \nillicit sales, or for not abandoning longstanding \npractices \nthat\u2014while \ndesigned \nfor \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans\u2014criminals have been able to exploit. See \nid. 84a (\u00b6 246: \u201cDefendants do not need legislation in \norder to make these reforms\u201d). \nDesign. Mexico asserts Petitioners \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales by continuing to \n\u201cdesign\u201d what Mexico calls \u201cmilitary-style assault \nweapons.\u201d Id. 93a. For instance, Mexico takes issue \nwith Petitioners making and selling lawful firearms \nlike the AR-15 rifle, and firearms capable of accepting \n\u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of which Mexico \nsays are popular among criminals. Id. 121a (\u00b6 334); \n96a (\u00b6 288). And Mexico criticizes the industry for not \n\n \n42 \n \n \nadding certain \u201csafety features\u201d it says will dampen \ncriminal interest. E.g., 129a (\u00b6 359) (calling for \u201csmart \nguns\u201d), 131a (\u00b6 365) (same for harder-to-defile serial \nnumbers). \nOf note, Mexico never alleges that any Petitioner \naffirmatively designed these products to aid any \ncriminal activity. Nor would any such claim be \nplausible. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the \ncountry; and there are hundreds of millions of \u201clarge-\ncapacity\u201d magazines in America. Moreover, Mexico \nconcedes that all of these arms are perfectly legal \nunder America\u2019s extensive firearm regulations. \nMexico\u2019s charge is that in continuing to produce \nthese firearms\u2014despite knowing criminals desire to \nuse them\u2014the industry has chosen to \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales. Id. 93a. To avoid \nliability, Mexico says the industry \u201ccould limit their \nsales of these military-style assault weapons to \nmilitary and perhaps some law enforcement units.\u201d \nId. 104a (\u00b6 314). Or it \u201ccould restrict the sale of these \nweapons to purchasers with a legitimate need for \nthem.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 315). Or it \u201ccould make guns [that do] not \naccept [any] high-capacity magazines.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 317). \nBoiled down, Mexico faults Petitioners for \u201cnot\u201d \naltering their longstanding design practices to better \nsuppress the criminal demand for their firearms. Id. \n(\u00b6\u00b6 314-18). \nMarketing. \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 \nlongstanding marketing practices help boost unlawful \nfirearm sales. It does not allege any Petitioner \nengages in any campaigns tailored to any criminal \nconduct\u2014e.g., touting a new inconspicuous handgun, \nperfect for subway muggings. Instead, Mexico alleges \n\n \n43 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 marketing tactics showcase the \u201cfeatures, \nfunctions, and applications\u201d of their firearms in ways \nthat have appealed to criminals\u2014such as by using \nimages of the \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d as well as \n\u201cAmerican flags.\u201d E.g., id. 105a, 127a (\u00b6\u00b6 322, 352). \nMexico implies Petitioners should have stopped \nadvertising their firearms this way once it became \nclear that criminals were attracted to their potential \nmilitary-like uses. In this sense, though, Mexico\u2019s \nmarketing-related claims are just derivative of its \ndesign-related ones. As Chief Judge Saylor explained, \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms \u201cdo exactly what they are \nadvertised to do\u201d: The advertisements Mexico \nidentifies show how these products work in the real \nworld\u2014including how some are used by police. Id. \n255a-59a. Mexico faults Petitioners for showing these \ntrue facts, but that gripe flows entirely from Mexico\u2019s \nview that firearms with these traits should not be sold \nat all (or at least, not to regular Americans). \nDistribution. Finally, Mexico takes issue with the \n\u201cthree-tier distribution\u201d system sanctioned by the \nfederal government. Id. 140a (\u00b6 378). Within this \nsystem, \nfederally \nlicensed \nmanufacturers \nsell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers\u2014who then sell to the general public. \nHere too, Mexico does not suggest Petitioners set up \nthis system in order to promote unlawful sales. As \nMexico admits, the overwhelming majority of U.S. \nfirearm sales are by law-abiding dealers to law-\nabiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). And nobody even \nhints the industry developed its entire distribution \n\n \n44 \n \n \nframework to cater to an outlier, minute fraction of \nunlawful sales\u2014as opposed to its primary business. \nRather, Mexico\u2019s allegations concern a supposed \nfailure by Petitioners to augment this system with \n\u201cappropriate and prudent distribution practices\u201d that \nMexico thinks will help reduce unlawful firearm sales \ndownstream. Id. 139a-40a (\u00b6 377). Among other \nthings, Mexico insists that manufacturers and \ndistributors should impose \u201cmandatory background \nchecks for secondary gun sales,\u201d require downstream \ndealers to \u201climit[] sales of multiple guns,\u201d \u201csupervise\u201d \nprivate \u201ckitchen-table\u201d sales, set up a system for \nmitigating lost or stolen firearms, and \u201crestrict[]\u201d \nsales of \u201cassault weapons.\u201d See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 89a-\n90a, 132a (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 264, 269, 369). \nMexico accepts that none of this is required by any \nAmerican firearms law. Instead, it faults Petitioners \nfor having \u201cchos[en] not\u201d to go beyond what those laws \nsay, to \u201ccontrol[]\u201d downstream dealers. Id. 139a-41a, \n104a (\u00b6\u00b6 377-79, 382, 315). \n3. These allegations fall far short of aiding and \nabetting. Mexico\u2019s claim reduces to Petitioners \nengaging in routine business practices while passively \ndeclining to do more to stop independent retailers \nfrom breaking the law. But such inaction does not \nsuffice. As this Court has emphasized, there is a core \ndifference between \u201cfailing to stop\u201d downstream \ncrime, and affirmatively abetting it through active \nparticipation. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 503. And that \nfundamental distinction resolves this issue: A lawful \nsupplier is not an accomplice to every independent \nseller of its good that it fails to make follow the law. \n\n \n45 \n \n \na. Mexico\u2019s complaint is foreclosed by Twitter. \nMexico claims that a \u201cmanufacturer of a dangerous \nproduct is an accessory or co-conspirator to illicit \nconduct by downstream actors where it continues to \nsupply, support, or assist the downstream parties and \nhas knowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct.\u201d Pet.App.42a (\u00b6 110). \nBut that is exactly what Twitter rejected. The \nplaintiffs alleged that the platforms knowingly hosted \nterrorist content for years; that they knew groups like \nISIS depended upon their services for fundraising and \nrecruiting; that they knew how their recommendation \nalgorithms matched terrorist content with interested \npeople; and that the platforms \u201cfailed to implement\u201d \nbasic detection tools that would help weed out this \nproblematic content. See 598 U.S. at 480-82, 498. And \nthe plaintiffs alleged that the platforms refused to \ndepart from their routine practices, because they \n\u201cprofited\u201d from these terrorist accounts. Id. at 482. \nThis Court unanimously held those claims fell short \nof aiding and abetting. Many businesses know their \nproducts will be criminally misused downstream, just \nas the platforms in Twitter knew terrorists were \nmisusing their services. But continuing to sell a good \nor service is mere \u201cpassive assistance,\u201d not \u201cactive \nabetting.\u201d Id. at 499. Staying the course with routine \nbusiness practices is not \u201caffirmative misconduct.\u201d Id. \nat 500. It is instead the sort of \u201cfailure to act\u201d that does \nnot trigger liability. Id. at 500-01. Indeed, any other \nrule would constitute a remarkable expansion of the \ncriminal law\u2014and would task private companies with \na roving mandate to \u201cdiscover[]\u201d and \u201cterminate\u201d any \ncustomers \u201cusing [their] service[s] for illicit ends,\u201d or \nelse risk crippling liability. Id. at 501. \n\n \n46 \n \n \nAs the above makes clear, Mexico does not allege a \nsingle \u201caffirmative act\u201d by Petitioners, performed with \nthe \u201cintent of facilitating\u201d illicit firearms sales by \ndealers. Id. at 490. Instead, Mexico\u2019s complaint rests \nentirely on the American firearms industry refusing \nto depart from routine, existing, and settled business \npractices\u2014be it refusing to scrap certain products \n(like the AR-15), or declining to impose extralegal \ncriteria on downstream retailers (such as limiting \nsales by \u201clegitimate need\u201d). But as explained, when a \nbusiness refuses to depart from the ordinary course\u2014\nwhen \nit \ndeclines \nto \nchange \nits longstanding \npractices\u2014that is precisely the sort of \u201comission[], \ninaction[], or nonfeasance\u201d that has never been \nenough for accomplice liability. Id. at 489. \nAt worst, even in the darkest light, Petitioners are \nportrayed as apathetic to how their products will later \nbe used just so long as they keep selling. This is false, \nbut even if it were true, such behavior\u2014\u201carm\u2019s length, \npassive, and largely indifferent\u201d to whatever the \nactual goals of the buyer may be\u2014is definitionally \ninsufficient for aiding and abetting. Id. at 500-01. \nb. If anything, Mexico\u2019s theory here is even more \nclearly invalid than in Twitter. There, the plaintiffs at \nleast named a specific criminal enterprise (ISIS) and \na specific bad act the defendants supposedly abetted \n(the Reina nightclub attack). Id. at 497-98. But here, \nMexico does not even do that: Its theory is that \nPetitioners have aided and abetted \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d in this country, writ large. BIO 27. Such a \nsweeping claim is unprecedented. No court has ever \nheld that an industry can aid and abet a class of crime \nwithout even naming the actual bad acts or actors \nbeing aided. \n\n \n47 \n \n \nIn addition, unlike in Twitter, all of the downstream \n\u201ccriminals\u201d that Petitioners are supposedly aiding and \nabetting are federally licensed firearm dealers. Under \nfederal law, the Attorney General is responsible for \ndetermining who should be licensed to sell firearms. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. If any dealer were conspicuously \nmaking unlawful sales, then it presumably would be \nprosecuted, or at minimum federal authorities would \nrevoke its license. When the federal government \nchooses not to do so, Petitioners cannot be readily \nblamed for selling to those dealers licensed to buy. \nIndeed, it would be extraordinary to say that \nPetitioners can be held liable for making routine sales \nof lawful products to such federally approved entities. \nIn short, Mexico has not uncovered what every U.S. \ngovernmental agency has missed: America\u2019s firearms \nindustry has not been criminally aiding and abetting \nunlawful firearms sales in broad daylight for decades. \nC. Knowing Some Downstream Sellers \nMake Unlawful Sales Does Not Make \nPetitioners Criminal Accomplices. \nMexico\u2019s sole response is that its complaint can be \nfairly read to allege that Petitioners know the \nidentities of some licensed dealers downstream that \nengage in unlawful sales\u2014and that Petitioners are \nthus liable for failing to purge them from firearms \ndistribution networks. BIO 26-30; see Pet.App.301a. \nThis argument fails twice over. For one, the complaint \ndoes not plausibly allege Petitioners know specific \ndealers that are making unlawful sales. And \nregardless, such mere knowledge would not trigger \nliability. \n\n \n48 \n \n \nFirst, Mexico has not alleged sufficient facts to \nplausibly show that any Petitioner sold firearms to \nany dealer that it knew would sell them unlawfully. \nAs noted, all but one of the Petitioners are \nmanufacturers, who are not alleged to sell to retailers \nat all. Thus, at best, Mexico\u2019s claim is that the \nmanufacturer Petitioners should stop independent \ndistributors from selling to some downstream dealers. \nAnd as for the one Petitioner that is a distributor, the \ncomplaint does not allege any facts showing it \nknowingly sold to any unlawful dealer.  \nMexico points to public information about some \nfederally licensed dealers whose firearms have been \nrecovered at crime scenes\u2014along with \u201ctrace requests\u201d \nshowing some sold a \u201cdisproportionat[e]\u201d number of \nfirearms used in crimes. BIO 5-6, 28-29. But as other \ncourts have held, alleging that a \u201clicensed distributor \nor dealer\u201d sold firearms later used in crimes does not \nstate a plausible claim that the distributor or dealer \n\u201chas committed an illegal act.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424 n.14 (rejecting similar argument on motion to \ndismiss); see Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 96 \nN.Y.2d 222, 237-40 & n.8 (N.Y. 2001) (\u201cATF \nemphasizes that the appearance of [a dealer] . . . in \nassociation with a crime gun or in association with \nmultiple crime guns in no way suggests that [it] . . . \nhas committed criminal acts\u201d). After all, most \nfirearms used in crimes were sold lawfully, and then \nmisused later. See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice, \nSource and Use of Firearms Involved in Crimes: \nSurvey of Prison Inmates 2016, at 1 (2019), \nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/document/suficspi16.pdf. \nAnd \nwhere the allegations are merely \u201cconsistent with\u201d \nunlawful conduct, but there are still \u201cmore likely \n\n \n49 \n \n \nexplanations,\u201d the complaint does not \u201cplausibly \nestablish\u201d a violation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009).  \nHere, the obvious \u201cmore likely explanation\u201d is that \nthe identified federally licensed dealers are not \nknowingly engaged in unlawful sales, but simply that \nsome firearms they sell are later misused. Otherwise, \nif such public information were enough to know they \nwere making unlawful sales, the federal government \npresumably would not continue to license them. \nSecond, even if Petitioners did know that some \nlicensed downstream dealers had unlawfully sold \ntheir products, that would not make them accomplices \nfor the same reason as in Twitter: Petitioners are \nengaged in nothing more than routine business \npractices, and their relationship with independent \ndealers is, at worst, \u201carm\u2019s length, passive, and largely \nindifferent.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 500. If the rule were \notherwise, every industry\u2014from beer to cars to \nknives\u2014would be on the hook for the predictable \nmisuse of its product. \nIndeed, Twitter itself was premised on the \nallegation the platforms knew terrorists were using \ntheir services. The complaints emphasized how easy \nit was for people to find ISIS-related content on those \nsites; and plaintiffs specifically alleged the platforms \neither knew of certain terrorist accounts, or refrained \nfrom taking simple steps to purge them. Id. at 481-82. \nEven so, accomplice liability does not follow from a \nbusiness\u2019s failure to \u201cterminate customers after \ndiscovering that the customers were using [their] \nservice[s] for illicit ends.\u201d Id. at 501. For liability to \nattach, something more is required than \u201cknowing \n\n \n50 \n \n \nthat the wrongdoers were using [one\u2019s] services and \nfailing to stop them.\u201d Id. at 503. There must be some \nadditional affirmative culpable act taken with the \nactual intent of facilitating the crime itself. Id. at 499-\n503. Routine business practices are not enough. \nAt bottom, when the maker or supplier of a lawful \nproduct places it into the general stream of commerce, \nthat business is not charged with purging all \ncriminals who may be waiting along the banks. And \nthe passive failure to do so is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to give rise \nto accomplice liability. Id. at 503. Responsibility for \nany criminal acts by those who misuse the product \nrests with those criminal actors themselves\u2014not the \nupstream manufacturers or sellers. Id. \nCONCLUSION \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed. \n \n \n \n\n \n51 \n \n \nNovember 26, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of no specific knowledge about this case. This observation, representing an initial analysis of the case's posture, provides the foundational legal framework necessary for a prediction.\n\nMy understanding has now evolved. I recognize that the central conflict in *Smith & Wesson v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos* revolves around the interpretation of a specific federal statute: the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). The PLCAA generally shields gun manufacturers from liability for harms caused by the criminal misuse of their products.\n\nThe critical legal battleground, as identified by the First Circuit's decision, is the PLCAA's \"predicate exception.\" This exception allows lawsuits to proceed if they are based on a knowing violation of a federal or state statute directly applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms.\n\nTherefore, my analysis must focus on the following key parameters (\u03b8) which will determine the Supreme Court's ruling:\n1.  **Statutory Interpretation of the Predicate Exception:** The core of the case will be how narrowly or broadly the Court interprets this exception. Does Mexico's allegation\u2014that the manufacturers' business practices aid and abet illegal trafficking\u2014constitute a \"knowing violation of a statute applicable to the sale or marketing\" of firearms? The manufacturers will likely argue for a narrow interpretation, requiring a violation directly committed by them in the specific sale, while Mexico will argue for a broader view that encompasses facilitating a pattern of illegal downstream sales.\n2.  **Proximate Causation:** The Court will have to evaluate the chain of causation between the manufacturers' legal sales in the U.S. and the subsequent harm caused by cartels in Mexico. The manufacturers will argue this chain is too attenuated and broken by the intervening criminal acts of traffickers, a classic argument against remote liability. Mexico will argue that this harm is a foreseeable consequence of the manufacturers' specific marketing and distribution practices.\n3.  **Extraterritoriality:** Although the First Circuit found the PLCAA applies to foreign plaintiffs, the Supreme Court may still consider the international context and the presumption against the extraterritorial application of U.S. statutes, especially concerning the predicate statutes Mexico claims were violated.\n\nMy belief has shifted from a blank slate to a structured understanding of the legal tests the Supreme Court will apply. I now know that predicting the outcome requires analyzing the specific arguments the parties will make regarding the scope of the predicate exception and the limits of proximate cause in a cross-border context. I still lack the specific precedents and textual arguments that will be presented in the parties' briefs, which is the next critical piece of information needed.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief state established that the Supreme Court's decision in *Smith & Wesson v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos* would hinge on its interpretation of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), specifically the \"predicate exception.\" This led me to identify three key parameters (\u03b8) for my prediction: the scope of the predicate exception (particularly what constitutes a \"knowing violation\"), the limits of proximate causation, and the background issue of extraterritoriality. I understood that the case would turn on whether Mexico's allegations of aiding and abetting illegal gun trafficking could overcome PLCAA's general immunity and satisfy common-law causation principles. However, I lacked the specific legal authorities and argumentative framing the parties would use.\n\nThe observation of the petitioners' merits brief provides a crucial infusion of specific legal arguments and precedents, dramatically sharpening my understanding of the legal battleground. My beliefs have now evolved significantly:\n\n1.  **Refined Understanding of the \"Predicate Exception\" Argument (Aiding & Abetting):** My general parameter of \"statutory interpretation\" has now been specified. The petitioners are framing the \"knowing violation\" prong of the predicate exception as a question of aiding-and-abetting liability. Their central argument, which is a powerful new signal, is that Mexico's claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's recent, unanimous decision in ***Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh***. They argue that, like the social media platforms in *Taamneh*, they are merely engaged in \"routine business practices\" and cannot be held liable as accomplices simply because they are generally aware that criminals misuse their lawful products. The petitioners contend that aiding and abetting requires an affirmative act taken with the specific intent to help a crime succeed, not merely a failure to adopt policies (like restricting sales of certain models or monitoring distributors more aggressively) that a plaintiff desires. This reliance on *Taamneh* provides a very strong, contemporary legal anchor for their position and suggests the Court will be asked to apply a high bar for liability that Mexico may struggle to meet.\n\n2.  **Solidified View of the Proximate Causation Challenge:** My previous understanding of proximate cause as a key hurdle is now reinforced with specific, powerful case law. The petitioners are not just arguing the causal chain is long; they are invoking a specific line of Supreme Court precedent\u2014including ***Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York***, ***Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp.***, and ***Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.***\u2014to argue that proximate cause requires a \"direct relationship\" between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury. They effectively weaponize Mexico's own complaint, framing the path from a legal U.S. sale to cartel violence in Mexico as an eight-step, attenuated chain broken by numerous independent and criminal acts of third parties. This framing directly mirrors the \"tenuous claims of causality\" that Congress identified as the target of PLCAA, strengthening the argument that Mexico's suit is precisely the type of \"lawfare\" the statute was enacted to prevent.\n\n3.  **Confirmation of Argumentative Strategy:** The brief confirms that the petitioners' core strategy is to portray Mexico's lawsuit as a radical departure from \"bedrock principles of American law\" that PLCAA was meant to codify. By focusing on *Taamneh* and the *Holmes* line of cases, they are grounding their defense not in a niche interpretation of a single statute, but in fundamental, trans-substantive principles of tort and criminal law that the current Court has shown a strong inclination to uphold. The framing is clear: Mexico's theory of liability is boundless and would endanger any industry whose products are ever misused, which is an outcome the Court is likely to view with skepticism.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has transitioned from a structural outline of the legal issues to a detailed map of the petitioners' specific and formidable legal arguments. I now know their defense rests on two pillars: (1) the high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability established in the recent, unanimous *Taamneh* decision, and (2) the traditional \"direct relationship\" requirement for proximate cause. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioners has increased, as they have presented a clear, powerful, and precedented path for the Court to reverse the First Circuit. The next critical piece of information is now respondent Mexico's brief, which must directly confront the formidable obstacles presented by *Taamneh* and the Court's proximate cause jurisprudence.",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.

Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20240703141240416_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoC.json (score: 0.439)\nNo. 23-1141 \nIN THE \nAnspretne Court of the giniteb Otate0 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nfor the First Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains \n8,747 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court \nRule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 3rd day o \nuly 202 \nAZA SALT y5ER \nON \nNOTARY PUBLIC \nDistrict of Columbia \nMy commission expires April 30, 2029.\n\n63: 20240703141249275_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoS.json (score: 0.430)\nEst. :4+ \nWILSONOES \nPRINTING \n(a, INC. \nE-Mail Address: \nbriefs@wilsonepes.com \nWeb Site: \nwww.wilsonepes.com \nNo. 23-1141 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n1115 H Street, N.E. \nWashington, D.C. 20002 \nTel (202) 789-0096 \nFax (202) 842-4896 \nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on July 3, 2024, three (3) copies of the BRIEF IN OPPOSITION in the \nabove-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.5(c), on the \nfollowing: \nNOEL J.

That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

Instead, it served to confirm and solidify my analysis of the petitioners' merits brief and to precisely identify the primary source of my current uncertainty.\n\nMy understanding of the legal landscape, built upon the petitioners' arguments, is unchanged and has been reinforced:\n\n1.  **\"Predicate Exception\" Argument (Aiding & Abetting):** My belief remains that the petitioners' strongest argument is their reliance on the recent, unanimous Supreme Court decision in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*. They have framed the PLCAA's \"knowing violation\" requirement through the lens of *Taamneh*'s high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability. This requires an affirmative, intentional act to further a specific crime, not merely engaging in \"routine business practices\" with general awareness that a product might be misused by third parties. This precedent presents a significant hurdle for Mexico.\n\n2.  **Proximate Causation Argument:** My belief is also firm that the petitioners have constructed a powerful proximate cause defense based on a consistent line of Supreme Court precedent (*Hemi Group*, *Holmes*, *Lexmark*). Their argument that proximate cause requires a \"direct relationship\" between conduct and injury, and that Mexico's claim involves a highly attenuated causal chain broken by the independent criminal acts of many third parties, aligns directly with the stated purpose of PLCAA.\n\n3.  **Overall Strategy:** The petitioners' strategy of grounding their arguments in broad, trans-substantive legal principles (*Taamneh*, *Holmes*) rather than a narrow, statute-specific interpretation remains a core component of my belief state. This approach is likely to be persuasive to the current Court.\n\nThe new observation has crystallized my understanding of my own epistemic state. It confirms that my analysis of the petitioners' case is robust, but my overall predictive model is incomplete. The single most important missing parameter (\u03b8) is now clearly defined: the legal reasoning and counter-arguments that will be presented in the respondent's (Mexico's) merits brief. My confidence in any final prediction is currently capped by the absence of this information. My belief state is now primed to evaluate how Mexico will attempt to:\n*   Distinguish its allegations from the facts of *Taamneh*.\n*   Justify a more expansive theory of proximate cause that can bridge the multiple steps between the defendants' sales and the harm in Mexico.\n*   Provide a competing interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception that does not require the specific intent articulated in *Taamneh*.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, the respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO), has substantially updated my belief state by providing the first clear view of Mexico's legal strategy and counter-arguments. It directly addresses the primary source of uncertainty I identified previously, allowing me to model the central legal conflict of this case with much greater fidelity. My prior beliefs about the petitioners' arguments remain stable, but they are now contextualized by the direct rebuttal from the respondent.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) for predicting the Supreme Court's ruling is now as follows:\n\n1.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*):** My belief that *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* is a central precedent is confirmed, but its application is now fiercely contested.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers argue that *Taamneh* sets a high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability, requiring an intentional act to further a *specific* crime, which they claim is absent here as they are merely engaged in \"routine business practices.\"\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (New Belief):** Mexico directly confronts this by arguing this case is \"as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\" They contend their complaint alleges \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" that goes far beyond passive acceptance or routine business. My belief state now incorporates Mexico's key factual allegations used to support this distinction:\n        *   **Targeted Supply Chains:** Knowingly supplying a small subset of \"bad apple\" dealers responsible for the vast majority of crime guns.\n        *   **Targeted Marketing:** Designing and marketing firearms to appeal specifically to cartel preferences, citing the example of Colt's \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, a \"particular favorite of the cartels.\"\n        *   **Active Resistance to Safety:** Resisting measures to curtail illegal trafficking and, in the case of Smith & Wesson, reneging on a 2000 federal settlement agreement intended to curb these same practices.\n    *   **Updated Analysis:** The core legal question is now clearer: Will the Court view the defendants' actions as \"routine business\" under the *Taamneh* framework, or will it accept Mexico's characterization of them as a \"deliberate\" and \"intentional\" scheme to profit from an illegal market, thereby satisfying the \"knowing violation\" standard of the PLCAA's predicate exception (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii))?\n\n2.  **Proximate Causation (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' proximate cause argument is now balanced by Mexico's direct response.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers argue for a \"direct relationship\" test, asserting that the causal chain is broken by the independent criminal acts of third-party traffickers and cartels.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (New Belief):** Mexico argues that the First Circuit correctly applied proximate cause principles. Their position is that the harm they suffered (e.g., massive expenditures to combat cartels, deaths of police and military personnel) was not an unforeseeable consequence of remote conduct. Instead, it was the direct and intended result of the manufacturers' business model of knowingly supplying the cartel market. The criminal acts of the traffickers are not, in this view, a superseding cause but rather the very mechanism of the harm the manufacturers allegedly facilitated.\n\n3.  **Overall Case Strategy & Procedural Posture (New Belief):** I have learned Mexico's procedural strategy for avoiding Supreme Court review, which also illuminates their potential merits arguments. They argue the petition should be denied because:\n    *   **It is a \"Poor Vehicle\":** The case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, meaning there is no developed factual record. Mexico will argue that the Court should not rule on such significant issues based only on allegations.\n    *   **There is No Circuit Split:** Mexico asserts that the cases cited by the petitioners to show a split are inapposite because they were decided before PLCAA's enactment, under different state laws, or on \"less egregious and less detailed allegations.\"\n    *   **The First Circuit was Correct:** Mexico frames the lower court's decision as a straightforward application of pleading standards to a uniquely detailed and fact-rich complaint.\n\nMy confidence in a final prediction has increased significantly. While the full merits briefs are yet to come, this BIO provides a robust framework for Mexico's case. The central conflict is no longer one-sided in my model. The key uncertainty has shifted from *what* Mexico will argue to *how persuasively* they can distinguish their facts from the legal standard in *Taamneh* and convince the Court that the harm they suffered was a direct result of the manufacturers' alleged scheme, not merely the attenuated result of third-party crime.",

They characterize their actions as general and routine business.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** Mexico argues its allegations describe conduct far more specific and intentional than the passive platform services in *Taamneh*. My model incorporates Mexico's key factual claims supporting this distinction:\n        *   **Targeted Supply:** Knowingly channeling guns to a small number of \"bad apple\" dealers known to supply cartels.\n        *   **Targeted Design:** Marketing firearms with features and aesthetics (e.g., Colt's \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\") specifically appealing to cartel culture.\n        *   **Active Resistance:** Opposing safety measures and, in one instance, allegedly reneging on a prior agreement to curb illegal trafficking.\n    *   **Updated Analysis (Stable):** The key question for the Court is how to classify the alleged conduct. Is it \"routine business\" under the *Taamneh* framework, or is it a \"deliberate\" and \"intentional\" course of conduct to profit from an illegal market, thus meeting the PLCAA predicate exception standard (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii))?\n\n2.  **Proximate Causation (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*):** The dispute over proximate cause is now well-defined, balancing the petitioners' \"direct relationship\" test against Mexico's argument that the harm was a direct and foreseeable result of a deliberate business model.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The causal chain is too attenuated and is broken by the independent criminal acts of third-party traffickers and cartels.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** The harm to Mexico (e.g., costs of combating heavily armed cartels) was the direct and intended consequence of the manufacturers' business model. The traffickers' criminal acts were not a superseding cause but the very mechanism of the harm the manufacturers allegedly facilitated.\n\n3.  **Overall Case Strategy & Procedural Posture (Stable Belief):** Mexico's arguments in its BIO reveal its strategy for avoiding Supreme Court review, which also provides a preview of its potential merits arguments.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\":** The case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, lacking a factual record, making it unsuitable for a broad ruling.\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** The cases cited by petitioners are allegedly distinguishable.\n    *   **First Circuit was Correct:** The lower court's decision is framed as a standard application of pleading rules to a uniquely detailed complaint.\n\n**Refinement of Belief State:** The latest observation, while not adding new facts, has refined my understanding of the *quality* of my current beliefs.

      "eig_reasoning": "This action seeks the petitioners' reply brief, the final document in the certiorari-stage briefing. \n\nTask EIG (0.9): The value is extremely high. My current belief state is built on the petition and the brief in opposition. The primary uncertainty is how the petitioners will counter Mexico's specific arguments, especially its attempt to distinguish the detailed allegations in its complaint from the general platform services in *Taamneh*. The reply brief will directly address this, providing the petitioners' final, sharpened argument for why the Court should grant review. This will cause a significant update to my model of the case's legal landscape and the probability of a cert grant.\n\nDesign EIG (0.6): The action provides a strong, generalizable insight into SCOTUS practice. It reinforces the importance of analyzing the full sequence of cert-stage briefing (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) to understand how legal arguments are refined. Observing how petitioners counter a respondent's 'poor vehicle' and 'no split' arguments in their final filing is a key data point for building a better general model of what makes a cert petition successful. \n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action is crucial for the specific task and highly informative for general strategy, making it an excellent choice. It directly targets the most salient missing information at this procedural stage.",

The design beliefs are minimal or absent here, showing only a basic meta-level awareness of the certiorari stage and strategic implications, thus rated low to moderate (design_complexity=0.35). The beliefs are internally consistent and well-integrated, with clear distinctions between parties' positions and legal standards, supporting a high coherence score (0.9). The information density is high due to the inclusion of multiple detailed factual and legal elements, but not maximal since some design beliefs are missing (information_density=0.85). Overall confidence is high given the clarity and depth of the analysis.",

          "task_beliefs": "This observation is an internal reflection on the information-gathering process and does not introduce new external facts, evidence, or legal arguments related to the *Smith & Wesson v. Mexico* case. It confirms my understanding of the case's procedural posture (certiorari stage) and the current state of the briefing. As it does not alter the substantive legal analysis required for the prediction, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are preserved from the previous update.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) for predicting the Supreme Court's ruling remains as follows:\n\n1.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*):** The central conflict is whether the gun manufacturers' alleged conduct constitutes \"routine business practices\" shielded by *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*, or an \"intentional scheme\" that satisfies the \"knowing violation\" standard of the PLCAA's predicate exception.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers maintain that *Taamneh* requires a high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability\u2014intent to further a *specific* crime\u2014which is absent here. They characterize their actions as general and routine business.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** Mexico argues its allegations describe conduct far more specific and intentional than the passive platform services in *Taamneh*. My model incorporates Mexico's key factual claims supporting this distinction:\n        *   **Targeted Supply:** Knowingly channeling guns to a small number of \"bad apple\" dealers known to supply cartels.\n        *   **Targeted Design:** Marketing firearms with features and aesthetics (e.g., Colt's \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\") specifically appealing to cartel culture.\n        *   **Active Resistance:** Opposing safety measures and, in one instance, allegedly reneging on a prior agreement to curb illegal trafficking.\n    *   **Updated Analysis (Stable):** The key question for the Court is how to classify the alleged conduct. Is it \"routine business\" under the *Taamneh* framework, or is it a \"deliberate\" and \"intentional\" course of conduct to profit from an illegal market, thus meeting the PLCAA predicate exception standard (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii))?\n\n2.  **Proximate Causation (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*):** The dispute over proximate cause is now well-defined, balancing the petitioners' \"direct relationship\" test against Mexico's argument that the harm was a direct and foreseeable result of a deliberate business model.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The causal chain is too attenuated and is broken by the independent criminal acts of third-party traffickers and cartels.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** The harm to Mexico (e.g., costs of combating heavily armed cartels) was the direct and intended consequence of the manufacturers' business model. The traffickers' criminal acts were not a superseding cause but the very mechanism of the harm the manufacturers allegedly facilitated.\n\n3.  **Overall Case Strategy & Procedural Posture (Stable Belief):** Mexico's arguments in its Brief in Opposition (BIO) reveal its strategy for avoiding Supreme Court review, which also provides a preview of its potential merits arguments.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\":** The case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, lacking a factual record, making it unsuitable for a broad ruling.\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** The cases cited by petitioners are allegedly distinguishable.\n    *   **First Circuit was Correct:** The lower court's decision is framed as a standard application of pleading rules to a uniquely detailed complaint.\n\n**Refinement of Belief State:** My belief state remains stable. The current observation reinforces the understanding that the case is at the certiorari stage and that the next piece of evidence will be the petitioners' reply to Mexico's BIO. This reply will be crucial as it will represent the manufacturers' direct rebuttal to Mexico's attempt to distinguish its specific allegations from the general conduct at issue in *Taamneh*. The primary uncertainty remains the potential evolution of arguments should the Court grant certiorari and the parties proceed to full merits briefing. My current prediction model is based on the cert-stage arguments, which are designed to persuade the Court to either take or deny the case, and may differ in emphasis from full merits arguments.",

The action correctly identifies the most critical missing information (the content of the petitioner's reply brief) and formulates a precise, high-probability-of-success plan to acquire it. The Design EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action demonstrates a highly generalizable and important strategy: iterative search refinement. The pattern of 'search -> analyze failure -> refine query with filters' is a core heuristic for effective information gathering in this environment, especially when dealing with dockets that contain multiple administrative files for a single filing event. The action's value lies in its strategic contribution to the overall process, making the subsequent action much more likely to yield high-value information.",

My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are updated to reflect the case's advancement, while the core legal analysis remains stable pending review of the newly filed document.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) for predicting the Supreme Court's ruling is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Timeline (Updated Belief):** The new observation confirms that the petitioners filed their \"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" on July 17, 2024. This is a critical milestone. It completes the primary briefing at the certiorari stage. The case is now fully submitted and ripe for consideration by the Justices at a future conference. The next significant event will be an order from the Court granting or denying the petition for certiorari.\n\n2.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Stable Belief; Awaiting New Evidence):** The central legal question remains whether the gun manufacturers' alleged business practices are shielded by the PLCAA or fall within its \"predicate exception\" for knowing violations of law. My model of this conflict is stable, but the newly filed reply brief is the key missing piece of evidence.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers argue their general sales and marketing practices do not meet the high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability established in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*, which they contend requires intent to further a *specific* criminal act.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** Mexico has argued in its opposition that its complaint alleges a specific, intentional scheme to supply the illegal cartel market, distinguishing it from the passive platform services in *Taamneh*. Key allegations include: knowingly using a small number of corrupt dealers, designing \"cartel-style\" weapons, and actively resisting safety measures.\n    *   **Anticipated Rebuttal (Refined Analysis):** The petitioners' reply brief, filed July 17, 2024, is their final chance at this stage to rebut Mexico's arguments. I anticipate they will argue that Mexico's allegations, even if true, still describe a course of conduct directed at a general market, not the kind of specific, overt acts required for aiding and abetting under *Taamneh*. The effectiveness of this rebuttal in framing Mexico's claims as legally indistinguishable from those in *Taamneh* will be a primary factor in the Court's cert decision. The content of this brief is the most important unknown variable at this moment.\n\n3.  **Proximate Causation (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Stable Belief):** The dispute over proximate cause remains a core issue, with the legal framework established by prior briefing.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The harm to Mexico is too remote, separated by the independent criminal acts of traffickers and cartels, breaking the chain of causation.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** The harm was a direct and foreseeable consequence of the manufacturers' business model, which allegedly relied on the criminal acts of traffickers as the intended mechanism to profit from the cartel market.\n\n**Refinement of Belief State:** My belief state is updated to reflect that the cert-stage briefing is now closed. The arguments the Justices will review to decide whether to take the case are now on the table. While the fundamental legal questions remain the same, the procedural context has advanced significantly. The primary uncertainty has shifted from \"What will Mexico argue?\" to \"How have the petitioners responded to Mexico's specific factual allegations in their final reply?\" Locating and analyzing the content of the July 17 reply brief is now the highest priority for refining my prediction model.",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v.

May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation is an internal monologue about the information-gathering process. It does not introduce new substantive facts, arguments, or evidence related to the case itself. Therefore, it confirms the current state of my knowledge and reinforces the previously identified information gap, but does not change my core task-level beliefs (\u03b8). My beliefs remain stable, pending the acquisition of the key missing document.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) for predicting the Supreme Court's ruling is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Timeline (Stable Belief):** The case is procedurally complete for the certiorari stage. The petitioners' \"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" was filed on July 17, 2024, closing the briefing. The case is now ready to be distributed for consideration by the Justices at an upcoming conference. The next observable event will be an order from the Court.\n\n2.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Stable Belief; Critical Information Still Missing):** The central legal dispute remains unchanged. The core question is whether the PLCAA shields the manufacturers or if their alleged conduct falls into the \"predicate exception\" for knowing violations of law. The new observation confirms that the content of the petitioners' final rebuttal on this point\u2014the reply brief\u2014has not yet been analyzed.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers argue their general business practices do not constitute the \"conscious, voluntary, and culpable participation\" in a specific criminal act required for aiding-and-abetting liability under *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** Mexico argues its complaint alleges more than general commercial activity. It points to specific allegations\u2014such as designing \"cartel-style\" weapons and using a known-corrupt distribution network\u2014as evidence of an intentional scheme to supply the illegal market, thereby distinguishing this case from *Taamneh*.\n    *   **The Known Unknown (Reinforced Belief):** The new observation reinforces that the most critical piece of missing evidence is the petitioners' reply brief. My previous analysis anticipated this brief would directly attack Mexico's attempt to distinguish its claims from *Taamneh*. The observation confirms my search for this document has so far only yielded administrative filings, meaning the petitioners' specific counter-arguments to Mexico's factual allegations remain unknown.\n\n3.  **Proximate Causation (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Stable Belief):** The arguments concerning the remoteness of harm are also stable and await the petitioners' final word in the reply brief.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The chain of causation is broken by the independent criminal acts of third-party traffickers and cartels, making Mexico's injury too remote from the manufacturers' legal sales in the U.S.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable Belief):** The harm was not just foreseeable but was the intended and direct result of a business model designed to profit from the illegal trafficking conducted by those third parties.\n\n**Refinement of Belief State:** My belief state is substantively unchanged. The new observation serves as a meta-update, confirming that the information gap I previously identified\u2014the content of the July 17 reply brief\u2014persists. The legal framework, the key precedents (*Taamneh*, *Holmes*), and the arguments from the petition and opposition are all stable parts of my model. The primary uncertainty is now not just an anticipation but a confirmed, immediate obstacle to refining my prediction. The highest priority remains locating and analyzing the text of the petitioners' reply brief to understand how they frame the case for the Justices in their final pre-conference filing.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, while failing to retrieve the petitioners' reply brief, has provided the full text of the respondent's (Mexico's) Brief in Opposition (BIO). This is a substantial information gain, moving my understanding of Mexico's arguments from a general summary to a detailed, evidence-based model. It clarifies their legal strategy, their refutation of the petitioners' claims, and their arguments against certiorari itself. The critical information gap\u2014the petitioners' final rebuttal\u2014persists and is now even more sharply defined.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8) for predicting the Supreme Court's ruling is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Timeline (Stable Belief):** The case remains ready for conference distribution. The briefing schedule is complete, with the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition now fully analyzed. The final piece of the puzzle, the Petitioners' \"Reply to Brief in Opposition,\" is still missing, but its importance has been magnified by the strength of the arguments in the BIO.\n\n2.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Belief Refined and Deepened):** The central legal conflict over the PLCAA's predicate exception is now understood with much greater nuance, particularly from the respondent's perspective.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The manufacturers maintain that their general business practices do not amount to the \"conscious, voluntary, and culpable participation\" in a specific crime required for aiding-and-abetting liability under *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Significantly Refined Belief):** The BIO provides the specific texture of Mexico's argument. They contend this is not a case of \"passive indifference\" but of \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" to profit from the illegal market. They explicitly argue, \"This case is as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\" Their allegations, intended to meet the *Taamneh* standard, include:\n        *   **Targeted Design/Marketing:** Creating products that \"intentionally cater to cartel demand,\" such as the Colt \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, a favorite of cartels.\n        *   **Knowing Supply Chains:** Deliberately supplying a known, small subset of dealers responsible for 90% of crime guns and continuing to supply specific dealers even after they are publicly identified as sources for weapons trafficked to Mexico.\n        *   **Affirmative Resistance to Safety:** Citing Smith & Wesson's decision to renege on a 2000 settlement agreement aimed at curbing the same unlawful practices at issue in this case.\n    *   **The Known Unknown (Reinforced Belief):** The detailed and specific nature of Mexico's allegations in the BIO makes the petitioners' reply brief absolutely critical. The key question is how the petitioners will rebut these specific claims of \"affirmative conduct\" and re-assert that their actions are indistinguishable from the general, \"arms-length\" business conduct protected in *Taamneh*.\n\n3.  **Proximate Causation & Circuit Split (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Belief Refined):** My understanding of the proximate cause debate is now more complete.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable Belief):** The harm to Mexico is too remote, as it is separated by the independent criminal acts of third-party traffickers and cartels. They argue the First Circuit's ruling on this point creates a circuit split.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Refined Belief):** The BIO directly attacks the \"circuit split\" claim. Mexico argues that the cases cited by petitioners are not comparable because they were decided *before* PLCAA's enactment, under different state laws, and on less detailed factual allegations. Mexico asserts that \"Different courts applying different laws to different facts reaching different conclusions is not a split.\" They also maintain the First Circuit correctly applied all proximate cause principles from *Holmes* and *Lexmark*, not just foreseeability.\n\n4.  **Certiorari-Worthiness (New Belief Category):** The BIO introduces explicit arguments against the Court granting the petition, which are crucial for predicting the outcome at this stage. Mexico argues this is a \"poor vehicle\" for review because:\n    *   **Interlocutory Posture:** The case is only at the motion-to-dismiss stage. A \"long road lies between the First Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment,\" and the Court typically prefers to review issues on a fully developed factual record.\n    *   **Unresolved Issues:** The district court has not yet ruled on other potential grounds for dismissal, such as personal jurisdiction or the failure to state a claim under state law, which could render a Supreme Court decision on the PLCAA issue moot for this case.\n    *   **Lack of Split/Importance:** Mexico frames the First Circuit's decision as a fact-bound application of established principles that does not conflict with any other court of appeals' interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception. They cite numerous state and federal district court cases (*Soto v. Bushmaster*, *Smith & Wesson v. City of Gary*) to show that allowing such cases to proceed past a motion to dismiss is not novel.\n\n**Refinement of Belief State:** My core beliefs about the legal questions are stable, but my understanding of the respondent's position has transformed from a sketch into a high-resolution image. I now have the specific textual evidence of how Mexico distinguishes *Taamneh*, refutes the existence of a circuit split, and argues against certiorari on procedural grounds. This deepens the central uncertainty: how will the petitioners' reply brief counter this detailed, multi-pronged opposition? The next observation must be the analysis of that reply brief to complete the picture before the Justices' conference.",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is a meta-cognitive reflection on the agent's internal search process and contains no new substantive information about the case of *Smith & Wesson v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos*. It confirms that the previous attempt to retrieve the petitioners' reply brief failed and outlines a new strategy to acquire it. As this observation does not introduce any new facts, legal arguments, or signals related to the Supreme Court's potential decision, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and unchanged from the previous update.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, which is preserved in its entirety, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Timeline (Stable Belief):** The case is fully briefed and awaiting distribution for conference. The critical missing document remains the petitioners' \"Reply to Brief in Opposition.\" The current observation reinforces that this information gap persists.\n\n2.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Stable Belief):** The central legal dispute is well-defined, with the respondent's detailed arguments from their Brief in Opposition (BIO) representing the most recent information.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable):** Their core argument is that their general business practices do not meet the high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability established in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*, which requires \"conscious, voluntary, and culpable participation\" in a specific crime.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable):** Mexico's position, as detailed in the BIO, is that the gun manufacturers engaged in \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" to profit from the illegal market. Their specific allegations\u2014including targeted product design (e.g., the Colt \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\"), knowing supply to high-risk dealers, and actively resisting safety measures\u2014are intended to distinguish this case from the \"passive indifference\" in *Taamneh*.\n    *   **The Known Unknown (Reinforced):** The lack of new information in this observation sharpens the focus on the primary uncertainty: how the petitioners' reply brief will specifically counter Mexico's allegations of \"affirmative conduct\" and re-situate their actions within the scope of protected, arms-length business conduct under *Taamneh*.\n\n3.  **Proximate Causation & Circuit Split (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Stable Belief):** My understanding of this issue is also unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance (Stable):** They argue the harm is too remote and that the First Circuit's decision creates a circuit split.\n    *   **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Stable):** Mexico's BIO directly refutes the existence of a circuit split, arguing the cases cited by petitioners are factually and legally distinguishable. They maintain the First Circuit correctly applied established proximate cause principles from *Holmes* and *Lexmark*.\n\n4.  **Certiorari-Worthiness (Stable Belief):** Mexico's arguments against granting the petition, introduced in the BIO, remain a key factor in predicting the Court's action. These arguments have not yet been rebutted by the petitioners.\n    *   **Interlocutory Posture:** The case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and the Court may prefer to wait for a more developed factual record.\n    *   **Unresolved Issues:** Other grounds for dismissal (e.g., personal jurisdiction) remain undecided at the district court level, creating a risk that a Supreme Court ruling on the PLCAA issue could become moot.\n    *   **Lack of Split/Importance:** Mexico frames the First Circuit's decision as a fact-specific application of existing law, not a novel interpretation creating a pressing need for review.\n\nIn summary, the recent observation was purely procedural to the agent's own operations and provided no new data to update my model of the case. My belief state is therefore held constant, with all prior analysis preserved. The entire predictive model now hinges on obtaining and analyzing the petitioners' reply brief, which is necessary to see how they respond to Mexico's robust opposition on both substantive and procedural grounds.",

Taamneh* due to 'affirmative conduct,' and the non-existence of a circuit split? The proposed action directly targets this critical information gap. The petitioners' reply brief is the only document that can provide this information. The potential for a significant belief update is enormous, as a strong or weak reply will drastically alter the probability of certiorari being granted. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is also high because this action provides a textbook example of the strategic importance of the reply brief in the certiorari process, especially in response to a well-argued BIO.

Shapiro et al., Supreme \nCourt Practice (10th ed. 2013) ............................. 11 \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case involves a foreign sovereign trying to use \nthe American court system to bankrupt the American \nfirearms industry based on novel and far-fetched tort \nclaims, contrary to an express statutory command laid \ndown by Congress. It warrants this Court\u2019s immediate \nreview.  \nAs the petition explained, the First Circuit\u2019s \ndecision eviscerates PLCAA and invites the exact \nlawfare the statute was designed to foreclose.  It \ncreates a circuit split on proximate cause, rejecting as \nnot \u201cpersuasive\u201d the approach multiple other courts \nhave taken on virtually identical claims.  And it defies \nthis Court\u2019s precedent on aiding and abetting, \nallowing companies to be sued just for making lawful \nproducts that independent criminals later misuse\u2014on \nthe other side of the border, no less. \nMexico\u2019s opposition has no answer to these basic \npoints. \nFirst, Mexico says the First Circuit did not split \nfrom other courts because they applied state common \nlaw rather than PLCAA. But that is an evasion: Each \napplied the traditional common-law rule of proximate \ncause, which is the exact rule PLCAA incorporates. \nThus, in allowing this case to proceed where identical \nsuits by American governmental plaintiffs failed, the \nFirst Circuit\u2014by its own admission\u2014created a square \nsplit. If anything, Mexico\u2019s suit presents an even \nweaker case for proximate cause compared to those on \nthe other side of the split: After all, Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain reaches across an international border, extends \nto foreign criminals, and ends with derivative injuries \nto a foreign sovereign.   \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSecond, Mexico argues that its claims satisfy this \nCourt\u2019s aiding-and-abetting precedent because the \ndefendant manufacturers allegedly \u201csupply\u201d bad-actor \ndealers. But Mexico\u2019s own Complaint admits that the \nmanufacturers do not sell directly to such dealers; \nthey \nsell \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers. Pet.App.140a. What Mexico means \nby \u201csupply\u201d is that manufacturers do not take \naffirmative steps to prevent wholesalers from re-\nselling to certain downstream dealers that allegedly \nmake some unspecified unlawful sales. Pet.App.140a-\n141a. But that is not aiding and abetting unlawful \nactivity\u2014any more than it was when Twitter failed to \npurge its platform of terrorists in Taamneh, or when \nBudweiser fails to affirmatively block wholesalers \nfrom delivering beer to liquor stores that sell to \nminors. By treating such passive failure to stop \ndownstream crimes as \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d Mexico \nthreatens to criminalize the ordinary production and \nsale of firearms\u2014as well as every other lawful product \nthat criminals may misuse. \nFinally, Mexico says the petition should be denied \nbecause it arises on a motion to dismiss, and this \nCourt can always grant review after the \u201clong road\u201d of \nlower court proceedings\u2014a road marked by invasive \n\u201cdiscovery,\u201d a lengthy \u201ctrial,\u201d and a multi-billion-\ndollar \u201cjudgment.\u201d BIO 2. But PLCAA\u2019s express \npurpose was to stop suits like this one from being \n\u201cbrought\u201d in the first place. The federal courts are \nsupposed to dismiss such suits immediately, before \ntheir tolls can be levied. The motion-to-dismiss \nposture is thus a feature, not a bug, of this petition. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S PROXIMATE CAUSE \nHOLDING WARRANTS REVIEW. \nA. The Decision Below Created a Split. \nMexico insists the First Circuit did not create a \nsplit. But that would be news to the First Circuit, \nwhich expressly broke from other courts\u2014including a \nThird Circuit decision joined by then-Judge Alito. It \ndid not try to distinguish those cases; it found them \nnot \u201cpersuasive.\u201d Pet.App.314a-315a.  \n1. Mexico first tries to cabin the conflicting cases by \nsaying they rested on state law, not PLCAA. BIO 13-\n14. But all involved the traditional common-law rule \nof proximate cause, which PLCAA incorporates. \nIndeed, many of the conflicting cases relied on this \nCourt\u2019s \ndecisions \naddressing \nthe \ntraditional \nproximate-cause rule. See, e.g., City of Philadelphia v. \nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, 423 (3d Cir. 2002) \n(relying on this Court\u2019s cases); Ganim v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., 780 A.2d 98, 121, 123 (Conn. 2001) \n(adopting principles \u201cdrawn from the decision[s]\u201d of \nthis Court, and applied by \u201cSecond Circuit\u201d in related \ncase); City of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A. Corp., 821 \nN.E.2d 1099, 1135-36 (Ill. 2004) (using common-law \nrule from Keeton treatise to reject foreseeability-alone \nposition); District of Columbia v. Beretta, U.S.A. \nCorp., 872 A.2d 633, 647-48, 650 (D.C. 2005) (en banc) \n(distilling same common-law principles).  \nNone of these cases turned on an idiosyncratic view \nof state law; all applied the same common-law rule of \nproximate cause that PLCAA incorporates; and all \nrejected the approach that animated the decision \nbelow.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2.  Mexico next tries to distinguish its case on the \nfacts. But Mexico is suing the same general \ndefendants, pressing the same legal theories,1 and \nusing (near verbatim copies) of the same allegations.2 \nThere is nothing new about Mexico\u2019s suit\u2014it is a \nphotocopy of others filed by domestic governments. \nAnd Mexico\u2019s attempted distinctions are illusory. \nFirst, Mexico says that in the other cases, the \nproximate cause analysis was based on manufacturer \nconduct, whereas under PLCAA, the causal chain \nstarts from the \u201cviolation\u201d committed by third-party \ndealers. BIO 15. Not so. PLCAA authorizes claims \nagainst defendants whose \u201cviolat[ion]\u201d of the law \nproximately caused harm. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(v). \nHere, the alleged violation is Petitioners\u2019 alleged \naiding and abetting\u2014not the substantive offense they \nallegedly assisted. See NSSF Am. Br. 11-12. So the \nissue is the same\u2014whether the manufacturers\u2019 own \nviolative conduct proximately harmed a government. \nThe other cases said no; the First Circuit said yes.  \n \n1 Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 419 (\u201c[P]laintiffs allege that \ndefendants\u2019 conduct in the marketing and distribution of \nhandguns allows them to fall into the hands of criminals\u201d); \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 109, 118-19 (similar); City of Chicago, 821 \nN.E.2d at 1109-10 (similar); D.C., 872 A.2d at 638 (similar). \n2 Philadelphia, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 888 (\u201cdefendants know, \nor willfully avoid knowing\u201d how their firearms end up with \ncriminal dealers); Ganim, 708 A.2d at 108, 110 (faulting \ndefendants\u2019 \u201cdesign[s]\u201d); City of Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1108 \n(defendants failed to follow \u201cATF traces\u201d and stop firearms \nfrom going to dealers with \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of \ntraced weapons); D.C., 872 A.2d at 638 (defendants are \n\u201ccreating, maintaining, or supplying the unlawful flow of \nfirearms\u201d). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nBut even if Mexico were right, it would not matter: \nAs the First Circuit recognized, starting the causal \nchain at unlawful sales by third-party dealers still \ninvolves six independent steps before Mexico is \nharmed. Pet.App.311a. The courts on the other side of \nthe split deem that multi-step chain too attenuated. \nThe decision below conflicts any way you slice it. \nSecond, \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPLCAA \ncannot \nincorporate the traditional proximate-cause rule that \n\u201cintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain,\u201d BIO 16, because otherwise no claim would ever \nsatisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Wrong again. \nJust like the traditional common-law rule, PLCAA \nrecognizes that a firearms manufacturer could be \nliable for directly facilitating criminal acts\u2014e.g., \ndirectly selling a firearm to a known criminal \nenterprise. But as the cases on the other side of the \nsplit recognize, that type of direct facilitation is very \ndifferent from the indirect scenario here: selling to a \nwholesaler, which sells to a retail dealer, which then \nmakes the independent decision to unlawfully sell the \nfirearm to a criminal, who then makes an independent \ndecision to use the firearm for criminal activity, which \nultimately \nresults \nin \nindirect \nharm \nto \nthe \ngovernmental plaintiff. Those multiple, independent, \nintervening criminal acts sever the causal chain to the \nmanufacturer. Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424. The \nFirst Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling creates a split. \nThird, Mexico maintains that unlike in the other \ncases, Petitioners here \u201cdeliberately chose to supply\u201d \ncriminal dealers. BIO 16, 26. But that is pure \nwordplay, and it ignores the actual allegations\u2014\nwhich are materially identical to the other cases.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Complaint does not allege that manufacturers \nsell to any dealers\u2014they are instead part of a three-\ntier system, where they sell to independent federally \nlicensed wholesalers, who then sell to independent \nfederally licensed dealers.  Pet.App.140a-41a. Indeed, \nas the First Circuit acknowledged, \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Instead, \nwhat Mexico means by \u201csupply\u201d is that Petitioners \nhave not taken affirmative steps to stop wholesalers \nfrom selling to alleged bad-actor retail dealers\u2014who \nare still licensed by the U.S. Government. The alleged \nfacts here are thus exactly like those in the cases on \nthe other side of the split: The key point is that the \nmanufacturers did not directly sell to anyone engaged \nin unlawful activity, but were merely aware that \nfirearms would flow downstream to unlawful actors, \nand they failed to take affirmative steps to stop the \nsupply. See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423; Ganim, 780 \nA.2d at 123-24. The other courts held proximate cause \nlacking on those facts. The First Circuit here \ndisagreed.3  \nFourth, Mexico says the causal analysis is unique \nhere \nbecause \nthere \nis \nsupposedly \nno \n\u201cready \navailability of firearms\u201d in Mexico due to its \u201cstrong \ndomestic laws\u201d against civilian ownership. BIO 17. \nBut the two cases it flags rejected the very same \nargument. See City of Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1107 \n(addressing Chicago\u2019s \u201cstrict\u201d gun-control laws); D.C., \n872 A.2d at 638 (same for D.C.\u2019s \u201cstringent\u201d laws).  \n \n3 One defendant, Witmer, is not a manufacturer but a \ndistributor. There is no allegation that it knowingly sold to \nany particular bad-actor dealer. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFifth, Mexico argues its injuries are different from \n\u201cderivative\u201d injuries elsewhere because Mexico has \nalleged \u201cdirect harm\u201d from criminal use of firearms, \nincluding \u201cincreased spending . . . and damage to its \nemployees and property.\u201d BIO 17. But those are the \nprecise harms the above cases rejected. See, e.g., \nPhiladelphia, 277 F.3d at 419, 424-25 (rejecting \nclaims of higher \u201ccosts\u201d that \u201carise only because of the \nuse of firearms to injure or threaten\u201d residents); \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 109, 118 (similar). \n4. Mexico last says this Court should decline review \nbecause of the \u201cthorny\u201d threshold question of what \nPLCAA\u2019s proximate-cause requirement means\u2014and \nwhether it is \u201cinformed\u201d by state law. BIO 13, 18-19. \nNonsense. PLCAA\u2019s proximate-cause provision is \nan express statutory requirement, and thus presents \na question of pure federal law. This Court regularly \nreads federal statutes as implicitly adopting the \n\u201cstandard requirement of proximate cause,\u201d so long as \nCongress has not explicitly displaced it. CSX Transp., \nInc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, \nC.J., dissenting) (collecting examples). It follows a \nfortiori that where Congress expressly incorporates \nproximate cause, it adopts its \u201cwell-settled meaning.\u201d \nJam v. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 210-11 (2019). \nThat is especially so here, where the entire point of \nPLCAA was to provide an independent federal limit \non what Congress rightly perceived to be novel state \ntort law run wild. Cruz, et al. Am. Br. 17-21; Montana, \net al. Am. Br. 6-10; FPC Am. Br. 11-14; MCRGO Am. \nBr. 19.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. The Decision Below is Wrong. \nMexico has no colorable argument that making or \nselling lawful firearms in the United States is the \nproximate cause of harms to the Mexican government \nstemming from cartel violence. If that is proximate \ncause, the concept is meaningless. \nMexico emphasizes that the First Circuit mouthed \nthe correct legal standard. BIO 19-21. But the \nproblem is that while it cited the right cases, it \nmisconstrued them to create a foreseeability-alone \ntest, contrary to this Court\u2019s express holding that \n\u201cforeseeability alone\u201d is not enough. Bank of Am. \nCorp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017). \nMexico denies that the First Circuit relied on \nforeseeability alone. But the opinion below tells a \ndifferent story. It defined proximate cause as \n\u201cforeseeability,\u201d and said PLCAA is not one of the \n\u201ccontexts\u201d where foreseeability is \u201cinsufficient.\u201d \nPet.App.309a. The court then assessed each aspect of \nthis \ncase \nthrough \nthe \nlens \nof \nforeseeability. \nPet.App.310a (defining \u201cMexico\u2019s claim of proximate \ncause\u201d in terms of foreseeability); 311a (same for \ntheory of injury); 311a (same for causal chain); 312a \n(same for dismissing intervening criminal acts). \nMexico\u2019s specific defenses rehash the flawed ones \nabove. BIO 19-25. It defends the court\u2019s attenuation \nanalysis by trying to shorten its causal chain; but it \nnever tries to defend why even six links (the best the \nFirst Circuit could do) are still not too many. Mexico \nsays the many crimes that punctuate its causal chain \ndo not sever proximate cause because they are \nforeseeable\u2014but it overlooks why those independent \ncriminal acts make its liability theory fatally indirect. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSee Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424. Likewise, Mexico \ninsists its alleged injuries are \u201cdirect,\u201d but never \nexplains why expenditures in response to others\u2019 \nharms are not derivative. Ganim, 780 A.2d at 118. \nAnd as for apportionment, Mexico still offers no way \nto apportion liability across numerous and distinct \nbad actors. See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425-26. \nII. THE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S AIDING-AND-ABETTING \nHOLDING WARRANTS REVIEW. \nAs for aiding and abetting, the BIO\u2019s rhetoric \ncannot obscure the absurdity of its thesis: That the \nAmerican firearms industry has been criminally \naiding and abetting gun-running to Mexican cartels \nfor decades, in broad daylight, with no American \nregulator or prosecutor lifting a finger. The decision \nbelow sustained this outlandish theory only by \ndefying Taamneh, with consequences that will be felt \nwell beyond the firearms industry. Atlantic Legal Am. \nBr. 12-16. \n1. Mexico says Petitioners are \u201cactive participants\u201d \nin cartel crimes, engaging in \u201caffirmative conduct\u201d to \nsupport them. BIO 2, 3, 11, 26, 29. But it cannot point \nto a single such allegation in the Complaint. After all, \nit targets essentially the entire American firearms \nindustry\u2014not any particular bad actor or specific act. \nAny fair reading of the Complaint\u2019s \u201c135 pages,\u201d BIO \n9, shows it rests entirely upon Petitioners refusing to \nstop making lawful products Mexico detests, or failing \nto impose gun-control measures it desires. Pet.26-29; \nPetApp.141a. For example, a central claim is that \nPetitioners \u201cactively assist and facilitate\u201d cartels by \nmaking standard rifles like the AR-15; such \nallegations appear over 50 times. E.g., Pet.App.93a.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n2. Mexico tries to narrow its aiding-and-abetting \ntheory, focusing on the claim that Petitioners are \ncomplicit in \u201cunlawful firearm sales.\u201d BIO 27. But the \nComplaint\u2019s charge is broader: Petitioners \u201caid and \nabet the killing and maiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \n\u201cdrug cartels.\u201d Pet.App.12a. And that is how the First \nCircuit read it. Id. at 305a.  \nIn any event, Mexico fares no better with its new \ntheme that Petitioners deliberately supply firearms to \nbad-actor dealers. As explained above, the Complaint \ndoes not allege that manufacturers sell to dealers but, \ninstead, to independent wholesalers. Supra at 4-5. \nRhetoric aside, Mexico\u2019s real claim is that Petitioners \nindirectly supply bad-actor dealers by failing to take \naffirmative steps to stop independent wholesalers \nfrom selling to them. Pet.App.140a-141a. But as this \nCourt \nhas \nheld, \nfailing \nto \nstop \ndownstream \nindependent actors from misusing a product to \ncommit a crime is not the same as aiding and abetting \nthat crime. Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, \n489 (2023). \n3. Direct Sales offers Mexico no quarter. See BIO 26-\n27. That case, as its name would suggest, involved a \nmanufacturer directly selling such an obscene amount \nof morphine to a specific doctor that it had to know he \nwas running a criminal drug enterprise. Thus, as \nTaamneh clarified, Direct Sales stands for the narrow \nproposition that directly selling products to support a \nknown criminal enterprise is a crime. 598 U.S. at 502. \nThat is nothing like Petitioners\u2019 alleged conduct\u2014\nwhich entails selling firearms to independently \nlicensed wholesalers, who resell to a variety of \nfederally licensed and highly regulated retail dealers, \nsome of whom may make unlawful sales downstream. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nIII. THERE IS NO VEHICLE PROBLEM. \nMexico\u2019s asserted vehicle problems ring hollow. \nFirst, Mexico stresses this case is \u201cinterlocutory,\u201d \nBIO 30-31, but it ignores that PLCAA\u2019s entire purpose \nis to ensure dismissal at the threshold. NSSF Am. Br. \n2-5, 16. Congress feared the \u201ccost of defending\u201d these \nsuits would \u201coverwhelm[]\u201d the industry. H.R. Rep. No. \n109-124, at 12 (2005); see Montana et al. Am. Br. 8-9; \nNRA Am. Br. 7-8. That is why the statute says such \nsuits cannot be \u201cbrought\u201d and must be \u201cimmediately \ndismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a)-(b). Otherwise, the \nimmense pressure of \u201cextensive discovery and the \npotential for uncertainty and disruption\u201d allows \nplaintiffs with bogus claims to \u201cextort settlements\u201d \nfrom \u201cinnocent\u201d companies that cannot afford to go \nthrough years of grueling litigation only to roll the \ndice again on this Court\u2019s review in the future. \nStoneridge Inv. Partners v. Sci.-Atlanta, 552 U.S. 148, \n163 (2008). The posture of this case thus counsels \nstrongly in favor of review. It presents a perfect \nopportunity to make clear that prompt dismissal on \nthe pleadings is warranted in cases like this. \nMexico does not dispute that reversal on the \nPLCAA issue would fully dispose of the case, or that \nthis Court has clear discretion to grant review now. \nSee Stephen M. Shapiro et al., Supreme Court Practice \n\u00a7 4.18 (10th ed. 2013) (collecting cases granting \nsimilar \u201cinterlocutory\u201d petitions). Indeed, this Court \ndid so recently in a similar case. RJR Nabisco v. Eur. \nCmty., \n579 \nU.S. \n325, \n334 \n(2016) \n(granting \ninterlocutory petition to reject foreign sovereign \nclaims against tobacco industry on motion to dismiss).  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nSecond, \nMexico \nis \nincorrect \nthat \npersonal \njurisdiction poses an obstacle. While some Petitioners \nhave disputed personal jurisdiction, others (including \nSmith & Wesson, which was based in Massachusetts \nPet.App.16a-17a), have conceded it. \nThird, as to summary reversal, Mexico tries to \ndistinguish qualified immunity denials, saying this \ncase involves only a \u201cstatutory bar on a certain type of \nsuit.\u201d BIO 34. But that also describes qualified \nimmunity under \u00a7 1983. And just like there, PLCAA \nis supposed to weed out meritless claims at the \nthreshold, before litigation burdens vest. \nFinally, Mexico is wrong that its multi-billion dollar \nsuit is of \u201climited importance.\u201d BIO 31. It does not \ndeny that it seeks damages that would bankrupt the \nfirearms industry; that it seeks injunctive relief \nimposing wide-ranging gun-control measures that \nAmerica\u2019s elected legislators have repeatedly rejected; \nor that its extreme theory of proximate cause and \naiding-and-abetting would have dire implications for \nmany other industries. Mexico\u2019s attempt to downplay \nthe importance of its unprecedented lawsuit is thus \njust as empty as the merits of its case. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nJuly 17, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

Shapiro et al., Supreme \nCourt Practice (10th ed. 2013) ............................. 11 \n \n \n\n1 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case involves a foreign sovereign trying to use \nthe American court system to bankrupt the American \nfirearms industry based on novel and far-fetched tort \nclaims, contrary to an express statutory command laid \ndown by Congress. It warrants this Court\u2019s immediate \nreview.  \nAs the petition explained, the First Circuit\u2019s \ndecision eviscerates PLCAA and invites the exact \nlawfare the statute was designed to foreclose.  It \ncreates a circuit split on proximate cause, rejecting as \nnot \u201cpersuasive\u201d the approach multiple other courts \nhave taken on virtually identical claims.  And it defies \nthis Court\u2019s precedent on aiding and abetting, \nallowing companies to be sued just for making lawful \nproducts that independent criminals later misuse\u2014on \nthe other side of the border, no less. \nMexico\u2019s opposition has no answer to these basic \npoints. \nFirst, Mexico says the First Circuit did not split \nfrom other courts because they applied state common \nlaw rather than PLCAA. But that is an evasion: Each \napplied the traditional common-law rule of proximate \ncause, which is the exact rule PLCAA incorporates. \nThus, in allowing this case to proceed where identical \nsuits by American governmental plaintiffs failed, the \nFirst Circuit\u2014by its own admission\u2014created a square \nsplit. If anything, Mexico\u2019s suit presents an even \nweaker case for proximate cause compared to those on \nthe other side of the split: After all, Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain reaches across an international border, extends \nto foreign criminals, and ends with derivative injuries \nto a foreign sovereign.   \n\n \n2 \n \n \nSecond, Mexico argues that its claims satisfy this \nCourt\u2019s aiding-and-abetting precedent because the \ndefendant manufacturers allegedly \u201csupply\u201d bad-actor \ndealers. But Mexico\u2019s own Complaint admits that the \nmanufacturers do not sell directly to such dealers; \nthey \nsell \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers. Pet.App.140a. What Mexico means \nby \u201csupply\u201d is that manufacturers do not take \naffirmative steps to prevent wholesalers from re-\nselling to certain downstream dealers that allegedly \nmake some unspecified unlawful sales. Pet.App.140a-\n141a. But that is not aiding and abetting unlawful \nactivity\u2014any more than it was when Twitter failed to \npurge its platform of terrorists in Taamneh, or when \nBudweiser fails to affirmatively block wholesalers \nfrom delivering beer to liquor stores that sell to \nminors. By treating such passive failure to stop \ndownstream crimes as \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d Mexico \nthreatens to criminalize the ordinary production and \nsale of firearms\u2014as well as every other lawful product \nthat criminals may misuse. \nFinally, Mexico says the petition should be denied \nbecause it arises on a motion to dismiss, and this \nCourt can always grant review after the \u201clong road\u201d of \nlower court proceedings\u2014a road marked by invasive \n\u201cdiscovery,\u201d a lengthy \u201ctrial,\u201d and a multi-billion-\ndollar \u201cjudgment.\u201d BIO 2. But PLCAA\u2019s express \npurpose was to stop suits like this one from being \n\u201cbrought\u201d in the first place. The federal courts are \nsupposed to dismiss such suits immediately, before \ntheir tolls can be levied. The motion-to-dismiss \nposture is thus a feature, not a bug, of this petition. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S PROXIMATE CAUSE \nHOLDING WARRANTS REVIEW. \nA. The Decision Below Created a Split. \nMexico insists the First Circuit did not create a \nsplit. But that would be news to the First Circuit, \nwhich expressly broke from other courts\u2014including a \nThird Circuit decision joined by then-Judge Alito. It \ndid not try to distinguish those cases; it found them \nnot \u201cpersuasive.\u201d Pet.App.314a-315a.  \n1. Mexico first tries to cabin the conflicting cases by \nsaying they rested on state law, not PLCAA. BIO 13-\n14. But all involved the traditional common-law rule \nof proximate cause, which PLCAA incorporates. \nIndeed, many of the conflicting cases relied on this \nCourt\u2019s \ndecisions \naddressing \nthe \ntraditional \nproximate-cause rule. See, e.g., City of Philadelphia v. \nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, 423 (3d Cir. 2002) \n(relying on this Court\u2019s cases); Ganim v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., 780 A.2d 98, 121, 123 (Conn. 2001) \n(adopting principles \u201cdrawn from the decision[s]\u201d of \nthis Court, and applied by \u201cSecond Circuit\u201d in related \ncase); City of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A. Corp., 821 \nN.E.2d 1099, 1135-36 (Ill. 2004) (using common-law \nrule from Keeton treatise to reject foreseeability-alone \nposition); District of Columbia v. Beretta, U.S.A. \nCorp., 872 A.2d 633, 647-48, 650 (D.C. 2005) (en banc) \n(distilling same common-law principles).  \nNone of these cases turned on an idiosyncratic view \nof state law; all applied the same common-law rule of \nproximate cause that PLCAA incorporates; and all \nrejected the approach that animated the decision \nbelow.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2.  Mexico next tries to distinguish its case on the \nfacts. But Mexico is suing the same general \ndefendants, pressing the same legal theories,1 and \nusing (near verbatim copies) of the same allegations.2 \nThere is nothing new about Mexico\u2019s suit\u2014it is a \nphotocopy of others filed by domestic governments. \nAnd Mexico\u2019s attempted distinctions are illusory. \nFirst, Mexico says that in the other cases, the \nproximate cause analysis was based on manufacturer \nconduct, whereas under PLCAA, the causal chain \nstarts from the \u201cviolation\u201d committed by third-party \ndealers. BIO 15. Not so. PLCAA authorizes claims \nagainst defendants whose \u201cviolat[ion]\u201d of the law \nproximately caused harm. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(v). \nHere, the alleged violation is Petitioners\u2019 alleged \naiding and abetting\u2014not the substantive offense they \nallegedly assisted. See NSSF Am. Br. 11-12. So the \nissue is the same\u2014whether the manufacturers\u2019 own \nviolative conduct proximately harmed a government. \nThe other cases said no; the First Circuit said yes.  \n \n1 Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 419 (\u201c[P]laintiffs allege that \ndefendants\u2019 conduct in the marketing and distribution of \nhandguns allows them to fall into the hands of criminals\u201d); \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 109, 118-19 (similar); City of Chicago, 821 \nN.E.2d at 1109-10 (similar); D.C., 872 A.2d at 638 (similar). \n2 Philadelphia, 126 F. Supp. 2d at 888 (\u201cdefendants know, \nor willfully avoid knowing\u201d how their firearms end up with \ncriminal dealers); Ganim, 708 A.2d at 108, 110 (faulting \ndefendants\u2019 \u201cdesign[s]\u201d); City of Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1108 \n(defendants failed to follow \u201cATF traces\u201d and stop firearms \nfrom going to dealers with \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of \ntraced weapons); D.C., 872 A.2d at 638 (defendants are \n\u201ccreating, maintaining, or supplying the unlawful flow of \nfirearms\u201d). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nBut even if Mexico were right, it would not matter: \nAs the First Circuit recognized, starting the causal \nchain at unlawful sales by third-party dealers still \ninvolves six independent steps before Mexico is \nharmed. Pet.App.311a. The courts on the other side of \nthe split deem that multi-step chain too attenuated. \nThe decision below conflicts any way you slice it. \nSecond, \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPLCAA \ncannot \nincorporate the traditional proximate-cause rule that \n\u201cintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain,\u201d BIO 16, because otherwise no claim would ever \nsatisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Wrong again. \nJust like the traditional common-law rule, PLCAA \nrecognizes that a firearms manufacturer could be \nliable for directly facilitating criminal acts\u2014e.g., \ndirectly selling a firearm to a known criminal \nenterprise. But as the cases on the other side of the \nsplit recognize, that type of direct facilitation is very \ndifferent from the indirect scenario here: selling to a \nwholesaler, which sells to a retail dealer, which then \nmakes the independent decision to unlawfully sell the \nfirearm to a criminal, who then makes an independent \ndecision to use the firearm for criminal activity, which \nultimately \nresults \nin \nindirect \nharm \nto \nthe \ngovernmental plaintiff. Those multiple, independent, \nintervening criminal acts sever the causal chain to the \nmanufacturer. Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424. The \nFirst Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling creates a split. \nThird, Mexico maintains that unlike in the other \ncases, Petitioners here \u201cdeliberately chose to supply\u201d \ncriminal dealers. BIO 16, 26. But that is pure \nwordplay, and it ignores the actual allegations\u2014\nwhich are materially identical to the other cases.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Complaint does not allege that manufacturers \nsell to any dealers\u2014they are instead part of a three-\ntier system, where they sell to independent federally \nlicensed wholesalers, who then sell to independent \nfederally licensed dealers.  Pet.App.140a-41a. Indeed, \nas the First Circuit acknowledged, \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Instead, \nwhat Mexico means by \u201csupply\u201d is that Petitioners \nhave not taken affirmative steps to stop wholesalers \nfrom selling to alleged bad-actor retail dealers\u2014who \nare still licensed by the U.S. Government. The alleged \nfacts here are thus exactly like those in the cases on \nthe other side of the split: The key point is that the \nmanufacturers did not directly sell to anyone engaged \nin unlawful activity, but were merely aware that \nfirearms would flow downstream to unlawful actors, \nand they failed to take affirmative steps to stop the \nsupply. See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423; Ganim, 780 \nA.2d at 123-24. The other courts held proximate cause \nlacking on those facts. The First Circuit here \ndisagreed.3  \nFourth, Mexico says the causal analysis is unique \nhere \nbecause \nthere \nis \nsupposedly \nno \n\u201cready \navailability of firearms\u201d in Mexico due to its \u201cstrong \ndomestic laws\u201d against civilian ownership. BIO 17. \nBut the two cases it flags rejected the very same \nargument. See City of Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1107 \n(addressing Chicago\u2019s \u201cstrict\u201d gun-control laws); D.C., \n872 A.2d at 638 (same for D.C.\u2019s \u201cstringent\u201d laws).  \n \n3 One defendant, Witmer, is not a manufacturer but a \ndistributor. There is no allegation that it knowingly sold to \nany particular bad-actor dealer. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFifth, Mexico argues its injuries are different from \n\u201cderivative\u201d injuries elsewhere because Mexico has \nalleged \u201cdirect harm\u201d from criminal use of firearms, \nincluding \u201cincreased spending . . . and damage to its \nemployees and property.\u201d BIO 17. But those are the \nprecise harms the above cases rejected. See, e.g., \nPhiladelphia, 277 F.3d at 419, 424-25 (rejecting \nclaims of higher \u201ccosts\u201d that \u201carise only because of the \nuse of firearms to injure or threaten\u201d residents); \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 109, 118 (similar). \n4. Mexico last says this Court should decline review \nbecause of the \u201cthorny\u201d threshold question of what \nPLCAA\u2019s proximate-cause requirement means\u2014and \nwhether it is \u201cinformed\u201d by state law. BIO 13, 18-19. \nNonsense. PLCAA\u2019s proximate-cause provision is \nan express statutory requirement, and thus presents \na question of pure federal law. This Court regularly \nreads federal statutes as implicitly adopting the \n\u201cstandard requirement of proximate cause,\u201d so long as \nCongress has not explicitly displaced it. CSX Transp., \nInc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 708 (2011) (Roberts, \nC.J., dissenting) (collecting examples). It follows a \nfortiori that where Congress expressly incorporates \nproximate cause, it adopts its \u201cwell-settled meaning.\u201d \nJam v. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 210-11 (2019). \nThat is especially so here, where the entire point of \nPLCAA was to provide an independent federal limit \non what Congress rightly perceived to be novel state \ntort law run wild. Cruz, et al. Am. Br. 17-21; Montana, \net al. Am. Br. 6-10; FPC Am. Br. 11-14; MCRGO Am. \nBr. 19.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. The Decision Below is Wrong. \nMexico has no colorable argument that making or \nselling lawful firearms in the United States is the \nproximate cause of harms to the Mexican government \nstemming from cartel violence. If that is proximate \ncause, the concept is meaningless. \nMexico emphasizes that the First Circuit mouthed \nthe correct legal standard. BIO 19-21. But the \nproblem is that while it cited the right cases, it \nmisconstrued them to create a foreseeability-alone \ntest, contrary to this Court\u2019s express holding that \n\u201cforeseeability alone\u201d is not enough. Bank of Am. \nCorp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017). \nMexico denies that the First Circuit relied on \nforeseeability alone. But the opinion below tells a \ndifferent story. It defined proximate cause as \n\u201cforeseeability,\u201d and said PLCAA is not one of the \n\u201ccontexts\u201d where foreseeability is \u201cinsufficient.\u201d \nPet.App.309a. The court then assessed each aspect of \nthis \ncase \nthrough \nthe \nlens \nof \nforeseeability. \nPet.App.310a (defining \u201cMexico\u2019s claim of proximate \ncause\u201d in terms of foreseeability); 311a (same for \ntheory of injury); 311a (same for causal chain); 312a \n(same for dismissing intervening criminal acts). \nMexico\u2019s specific defenses rehash the flawed ones \nabove. BIO 19-25. It defends the court\u2019s attenuation \nanalysis by trying to shorten its causal chain; but it \nnever tries to defend why even six links (the best the \nFirst Circuit could do) are still not too many. Mexico \nsays the many crimes that punctuate its causal chain \ndo not sever proximate cause because they are \nforeseeable\u2014but it overlooks why those independent \ncriminal acts make its liability theory fatally indirect. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSee Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424. Likewise, Mexico \ninsists its alleged injuries are \u201cdirect,\u201d but never \nexplains why expenditures in response to others\u2019 \nharms are not derivative. Ganim, 780 A.2d at 118. \nAnd as for apportionment, Mexico still offers no way \nto apportion liability across numerous and distinct \nbad actors. See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425-26. \nII. THE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S AIDING-AND-ABETTING \nHOLDING WARRANTS REVIEW. \nAs for aiding and abetting, the BIO\u2019s rhetoric \ncannot obscure the absurdity of its thesis: That the \nAmerican firearms industry has been criminally \naiding and abetting gun-running to Mexican cartels \nfor decades, in broad daylight, with no American \nregulator or prosecutor lifting a finger. The decision \nbelow sustained this outlandish theory only by \ndefying Taamneh, with consequences that will be felt \nwell beyond the firearms industry. Atlantic Legal Am. \nBr. 12-16. \n1. Mexico says Petitioners are \u201cactive participants\u201d \nin cartel crimes, engaging in \u201caffirmative conduct\u201d to \nsupport them. BIO 2, 3, 11, 26, 29. But it cannot point \nto a single such allegation in the Complaint. After all, \nit targets essentially the entire American firearms \nindustry\u2014not any particular bad actor or specific act. \nAny fair reading of the Complaint\u2019s \u201c135 pages,\u201d BIO \n9, shows it rests entirely upon Petitioners refusing to \nstop making lawful products Mexico detests, or failing \nto impose gun-control measures it desires. Pet.26-29; \nPetApp.141a. For example, a central claim is that \nPetitioners \u201cactively assist and facilitate\u201d cartels by \nmaking standard rifles like the AR-15; such \nallegations appear over 50 times. E.g., Pet.App.93a.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n2. Mexico tries to narrow its aiding-and-abetting \ntheory, focusing on the claim that Petitioners are \ncomplicit in \u201cunlawful firearm sales.\u201d BIO 27. But the \nComplaint\u2019s charge is broader: Petitioners \u201caid and \nabet the killing and maiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \n\u201cdrug cartels.\u201d Pet.App.12a. And that is how the First \nCircuit read it. Id. at 305a.  \nIn any event, Mexico fares no better with its new \ntheme that Petitioners deliberately supply firearms to \nbad-actor dealers. As explained above, the Complaint \ndoes not allege that manufacturers sell to dealers but, \ninstead, to independent wholesalers. Supra at 4-5. \nRhetoric aside, Mexico\u2019s real claim is that Petitioners \nindirectly supply bad-actor dealers by failing to take \naffirmative steps to stop independent wholesalers \nfrom selling to them. Pet.App.140a-141a. But as this \nCourt \nhas \nheld, \nfailing \nto \nstop \ndownstream \nindependent actors from misusing a product to \ncommit a crime is not the same as aiding and abetting \nthat crime. Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, \n489 (2023). \n3. Direct Sales offers Mexico no quarter. See BIO 26-\n27. That case, as its name would suggest, involved a \nmanufacturer directly selling such an obscene amount \nof morphine to a specific doctor that it had to know he \nwas running a criminal drug enterprise. Thus, as \nTaamneh clarified, Direct Sales stands for the narrow \nproposition that directly selling products to support a \nknown criminal enterprise is a crime. 598 U.S. at 502. \nThat is nothing like Petitioners\u2019 alleged conduct\u2014\nwhich entails selling firearms to independently \nlicensed wholesalers, who resell to a variety of \nfederally licensed and highly regulated retail dealers, \nsome of whom may make unlawful sales downstream. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nIII. THERE IS NO VEHICLE PROBLEM. \nMexico\u2019s asserted vehicle problems ring hollow. \nFirst, Mexico stresses this case is \u201cinterlocutory,\u201d \nBIO 30-31, but it ignores that PLCAA\u2019s entire purpose \nis to ensure dismissal at the threshold. NSSF Am. Br. \n2-5, 16. Congress feared the \u201ccost of defending\u201d these \nsuits would \u201coverwhelm[]\u201d the industry. H.R. Rep. No. \n109-124, at 12 (2005); see Montana et al. Am. Br. 8-9; \nNRA Am. Br. 7-8. That is why the statute says such \nsuits cannot be \u201cbrought\u201d and must be \u201cimmediately \ndismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a)-(b). Otherwise, the \nimmense pressure of \u201cextensive discovery and the \npotential for uncertainty and disruption\u201d allows \nplaintiffs with bogus claims to \u201cextort settlements\u201d \nfrom \u201cinnocent\u201d companies that cannot afford to go \nthrough years of grueling litigation only to roll the \ndice again on this Court\u2019s review in the future. \nStoneridge Inv. Partners v. Sci.-Atlanta, 552 U.S. 148, \n163 (2008). The posture of this case thus counsels \nstrongly in favor of review. It presents a perfect \nopportunity to make clear that prompt dismissal on \nthe pleadings is warranted in cases like this. \nMexico does not dispute that reversal on the \nPLCAA issue would fully dispose of the case, or that \nthis Court has clear discretion to grant review now. \nSee Stephen M. Shapiro et al., Supreme Court Practice \n\u00a7 4.18 (10th ed. 2013) (collecting cases granting \nsimilar \u201cinterlocutory\u201d petitions). Indeed, this Court \ndid so recently in a similar case. RJR Nabisco v. Eur. \nCmty., \n579 \nU.S. \n325, \n334 \n(2016) \n(granting \ninterlocutory petition to reject foreign sovereign \nclaims against tobacco industry on motion to dismiss).  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nSecond, \nMexico \nis \nincorrect \nthat \npersonal \njurisdiction poses an obstacle. While some Petitioners \nhave disputed personal jurisdiction, others (including \nSmith & Wesson, which was based in Massachusetts \nPet.App.16a-17a), have conceded it. \nThird, as to summary reversal, Mexico tries to \ndistinguish qualified immunity denials, saying this \ncase involves only a \u201cstatutory bar on a certain type of \nsuit.\u201d BIO 34. But that also describes qualified \nimmunity under \u00a7 1983. And just like there, PLCAA \nis supposed to weed out meritless claims at the \nthreshold, before litigation burdens vest. \nFinally, Mexico is wrong that its multi-billion dollar \nsuit is of \u201climited importance.\u201d BIO 31. It does not \ndeny that it seeks damages that would bankrupt the \nfirearms industry; that it seeks injunctive relief \nimposing wide-ranging gun-control measures that \nAmerica\u2019s elected legislators have repeatedly rejected; \nor that its extreme theory of proximate cause and \naiding-and-abetting would have dire implications for \nmany other industries. Mexico\u2019s attempt to downplay \nthe importance of its unprecedented lawsuit is thus \njust as empty as the merits of its case. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be granted. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nJuly 17, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, a failed search for the petitioners' reply brief, did not yield the intended document. However, it provided the full text of the respondent's (Mexico's) Brief in Opposition (BIO), which was previously understood only in summary. This allows for a significant refinement and deepening of my beliefs regarding Mexico's legal arguments and strategy. My core uncertainty\u2014how the petitioners will rebut these arguments\u2014remains and is now more sharply defined.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, incorporating this new level of detail, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Certiorari-Worthiness (Belief Refined):** My belief that the case's interlocutory nature weighs against certiorari is now strongly reinforced by the specific arguments in Mexico's BIO.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Argument (New Detail):** Mexico explicitly argues the petition presents a \"poor vehicle\" for review. The case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage, meaning the Court would be ruling on a limited factual record. Mexico highlights that other grounds for dismissal, such as personal jurisdiction, were not reached by the lower courts and could render a Supreme Court decision moot. This is a standard and often effective argument for denying cert.\n    *   **Interlocutory Status (Reinforced):** Mexico emphasizes that a long road remains (discovery, summary judgment, trial, appeal) and that the petitioners' challenges are \"best addressed on a developed factual record.\" This strengthens the probability that the Court, which generally disfavors interlocutory appeals, will deny the petition to await further proceedings.\n\n2.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Belief Deepened):** My understanding of Mexico's argument on this point has evolved from a general concept to a highly specific and detailed claim, based on the BIO's text.\n    *   **\"Affirmative Conduct\" vs. \"Passive Indifference\" (New Detail):** Mexico's case is not, as petitioners claim, about liability for \"mere knowledge\" or \"passive indifference.\" The BIO forcefully frames the lawsuit as being about the manufacturers' \"deliberately chose[n] to engage in unlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal market.\" This phrasing is a direct attempt to distinguish the facts from the \"general, arms-length\" business relationship in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*.\n    *   **Specific Allegations of \"Affirmative Conduct\" (New Detail):** The BIO provides concrete examples of this alleged conduct, which go far beyond simply manufacturing and selling a product:\n        *   **Targeted Marketing:** Designing and marketing specific firearms to appeal to cartels, such as the Colt \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, engraved with a motto favored by cartels.\n        *   **Knowing Distribution Channels:** Intentionally supplying a known, small subset of dealers responsible for the vast majority of crime guns, despite warnings from the DOJ and public reporting identifying these specific dealers.\n        *   **Willful Blindness to Data:** Ignoring ATF trace request data that identifies which specific dealers are the source of guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico.\n        *   **Active Resistance to Safety:** Resisting industry-wide safety measures and, in the case of Smith & Wesson, reneging on a 2000 settlement agreement intended to curb the same unlawful practices.\n    *   **Distinguishing *Taamneh* (New Detail):** Mexico argues that these specific allegations of intentional facilitation of a criminal market make the case \"as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\" They are not suing over a neutral service used by bad actors, but over a business model allegedly designed to profit from them.\n\n3.  **Proximate Causation & Circuit Split (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Belief Refined):** Mexico's BIO provides a direct and robust rebuttal to the petitioners' claim of a circuit split, clarifying the legal landscape.\n    *   **No Circuit Split (New Detail):** Mexico argues no split exists because the cases cited by petitioners are inapposite. They were (1) decided *before* the PLCAA was enacted, (2) applied various state-common-law doctrines, not the specific proximate cause standard of the PLCAA's federal predicate exception, and (3) were based on \"less egregious and less detailed allegations.\" The argument is that \"Different courts applying different laws to different facts reaching different conclusions is not a split.\" This is a powerful counter-argument to a primary reason for granting certiorari.\n    *   **Direct Harm (Reinforced):** The BIO frames Mexico's harm not as an indirect, downstream consequence but as a direct injury. Mexico itself is the entity spending \"vast funds\" to combat the cartels armed by petitioners' weapons and whose own military and police forces are killed and wounded by those same weapons. This framing attempts to satisfy the direct-step requirement of proximate cause established in cases like *Holmes* and *Lexmark*.\n\nIn summary, while the search failed to acquire the petitioners' reply brief, it provided the full text of the BIO, substantially enriching my understanding of Mexico's position. The arguments against granting certiorari (poor vehicle, no circuit split) are stronger and more detailed than I previously appreciated. Likewise, Mexico's substantive argument for how its allegations of \"affirmative conduct\" survive the *Taamneh* standard is now crystal clear. The central unknown remains the same, but the stakes are higher: the entire predictive analysis now hinges on how the petitioners' forthcoming reply brief will counter these specific, detailed, and forceful arguments.",

          "task_beliefs": "The acquisition of the petitioners' \"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" (Reply Brief) has resolved the central uncertainty of my previous belief state. I now have the gun manufacturers' direct counterarguments to Mexico's opposition, allowing for a comprehensive, point-for-point analysis of the competing legal claims. This observation fundamentally shifts the calculus regarding the likelihood of certiorari being granted.\n\nMy cumulative understanding, now integrating the petitioners' reply, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Procedural Posture & Certiorari-Worthiness (Belief Substantially Changed):** My prior belief that the case's interlocutory nature was a significant barrier to certiorari has been effectively dismantled by the petitioners' reply.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\" vs. \"Feature, Not a Bug\" (New Counter-Argument):** The petitioners have reframed the motion-to-dismiss posture from a weakness into the central reason for the Court's intervention. They argue that PLCAA's express purpose\u2014to prevent gun manufacturers from being subjected to the costs and pressures of litigation\u2014is defeated if suits like this are not \"immediately dismissed\" at the threshold. They contend that waiting for a full factual record would render the statutory immunity meaningless. This transforms the procedural posture from a \"vehicle problem\" into the very heart of the legal question.\n    *   **Precedent for Interlocutory Review (New Detail):** The petitioners cite *RJR Nabisco v. Eur. Cmty.* as a direct precedent where the Court granted an interlocutory petition to review a motion to dismiss in a case involving a foreign sovereign suing a U.S. industry. This precedent significantly strengthens their case for immediate review.\n    *   **Neutralizing Mootness Concerns (New Detail):** The petitioners counter Mexico's argument that other issues (like personal jurisdiction) could moot a Supreme Court ruling by noting that some petitioners, including Smith & Wesson, have conceded personal jurisdiction. This ensures the PLCAA question is a live and unavoidable controversy for the Court to decide.\n\n2.  **Proximate Causation & Circuit Split (*Holmes*, *Lexmark*) (Belief Substantially Changed):** The petitioners' reply directly attacks Mexico's assertion that no circuit split exists, making a compelling case that the First Circuit's decision is an outlier.\n    *   **The \"Traditional Common-Law Rule\" (New Counter-Argument):** The petitioners' core argument is that Mexico's distinction between state law and PLCAA is an \"evasion.\" They contend that the prior cases they cited (*City of Philadelphia*, *Ganim*, etc.) and PLCAA's predicate exception all incorporate the *same* \"traditional common-law rule of proximate cause.\" Therefore, by reaching a different conclusion on virtually identical facts, the First Circuit created a split on the interpretation of this fundamental legal principle as it applies in a federal statutory context. They note the First Circuit itself acknowledged it was breaking from these other courts by finding them \"not 'persuasive'.\"\n    *   **A Fortiori Argument (New Detail):** The petitioners argue that Mexico's case for proximate cause is even *weaker* than the domestic cases that were dismissed, as the causal chain here is longer and more attenuated, crossing an international border and involving foreign criminals and a foreign sovereign's derivative injuries.\n    *   **Foreseeability is Not Enough (Reinforced):** The petitioners accuse the First Circuit of misapplying Supreme Court precedent by creating a \"foreseeability-alone\" test for proximate cause, which they argue is contrary to holdings like *Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami*.\n\n3.  **The \"Predicate Exception\" & Aiding/Abetting (*Taamneh*) (Belief Substantially Changed):** The petitioners' reply aggressively frames Mexico's allegations as falling squarely within the conduct that *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* found insufficient for aiding-and-abetting liability.\n    *   **\"Affirmative Conduct\" vs. \"Passive Failure\" (New Counter-Argument):** The petitioners deconstruct Mexico's \"affirmative conduct\" claims (e.g., \"supplying\" bad-actor dealers) as \"pure wordplay.\" They clarify that the complaint does not allege direct sales to criminals but rather a *failure to take affirmative steps* to stop independent, federally-licensed wholesalers from selling to certain federally-licensed dealers. They argue this is precisely the kind of \"passive failure to stop downstream crimes\" that *Taamneh* held is not aiding and abetting.\n    *   **Distinguishing *Direct Sales* (New Detail):** They cabin the *Direct Sales* (morphine) precedent, noting that *Taamneh* itself clarified it applies to the narrow situation of a manufacturer *directly selling* to a known criminal enterprise. This is contrasted with the three-tier distribution system (manufacturer -> wholesaler -> dealer) at issue here.\n    *   **Absurdity of the Claim (New Rhetorical Framing):** The petitioners frame Mexico's entire theory as inherently implausible: \"That the American firearms industry has been criminally aiding and abetting gun-running to Mexican cartels for decades, in broad daylight, with no American regulator or prosecutor lifting a finger.\" This rhetorical framing highlights the extraordinary nature of the allegations.\n\nIn summary, the Reply Brief has provided the missing piece of the puzzle and fundamentally altered the landscape of the case at the certiorari stage. Where Mexico's Brief in Opposition presented strong arguments against review, the petitioners have met each with a powerful, well-supported counter-argument. The case is no longer about whether a \"poor vehicle\" should be reviewed, but whether PLCAA's statutory immunity must be enforced at the pleading stage. The petitioners have successfully framed the case as presenting a clear circuit split on the meaning of proximate cause and a direct conflict with the Court's recent *Taamneh* precedent, making a grant of certiorari now appear significantly more probable.",

Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred \nPrufrock (1915) ....................................................... 2\n\n1 \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nFormed in 2022, the American Free Enterprise \nChamber of Commerce (\u201cAmFree\u201d) is a 501(c)(6) \norganization \nthat \nrepresents \nhard-working \nentrepreneurs and businesses across the U.S. \neconomy. AmFree\u2019s members are vitally interested in \nU.S energy security and the continued viability of our \ncommercial republic. Shortly after its founding, \nAmFree launched the Center for Legal Action (\u201cCLA\u201d) \nto represent these interests in court. CLA is \nspearheaded by two-time former U.S. Attorney \nGeneral Bill Barr. \nAmFree submits this brief because the decision \nbelow is not just wrong, but would also have a \ncrippling effect on American industry and would \ndilute the constitutional requirement that \u201cNo person \nshall \u2026 be deprived of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCan the flutter of a butterfly\u2019s wing result in a \nnatural disaster on another continent? Edward N. \nLorenz, The Essence of Chaos 179 (1993). Or if the \nbutterfly \ndies, \ndoes \nits \ndemise \nchange \nthe \ndevelopment of the English language? Or the outcome \nof a presidential election? Cf. Ray Bradbury, A Sound \nof Thunder (1952). These are interesting questions for \nphilosophers, science fiction writers, and poets to \nponder. And while we may then wonderlike \n\u0001\n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and \nno person or entity other than amicus or its counsel made a \nmonetary contribution intended to fund its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n2 \n\u0001\nPrufrock\u2014\u201cDo I dare / Disturb the universe? \u2026. Do I \ndare to eat a peach?\u201d T.S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. \nAlfred Prufrock (1915)\u2014no one actually lives that \nway. And, until recently, no one would expect to find \nsuch \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d theories invading the forensic \ninquiries of judges and juries: \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a \nkingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nMexico begs to differ. It fears its kingdom will be \nlost\u2014not for want of a nail\u2014but for want of draconian \ngun laws in its neighbor to the north. And so it comes \nbefore this Court, asking it to all but erase the \ntraditional causation requirements of tort law. The \nresult would be chaos. That this Court must resolve \nwhether gun sales in the United States\u2014in whatever \nform\u2014are the proximate cause of cartel violence in \nMexico is alarming evidence that such litigation is out \nof control. \nAmicus writes to underscore three points. First, \noverextending proximate cause is incompatible with \ndue process. This Court has repeatedly reiterated the \nclose causal nexus necessary for liability and should \nreaffirm that now. \nSecond, foreseeability is an unbounded and \nunwieldy standard that hangs the sword of unlimited \nliability over the head of all American businesses \n(except for judgment-proof fly-by-night enterprises). \nEntire industries that supply the necessities of \neveryday life and sustain the economy could easily fall \nvictim to the same proximate-cause analysis. \n\n3 \n\u0001\nThird, each additional step in a causal chain \nallows foreign sovereigns to reach further beyond \ntheir borders and act as de facto policymakers in the \nUnited \nStates. \nNuisance \nlitigation \nbased \non \nattenuated \ncausation \nhas \nalready \nfrayed \nthe \nrelationship between the several States of the union, \nand adding foreign sovereigns to the mix will only \nmake matters worse. \n* * * \nFrancis Bacon was right: In jure non remota \ncausa, sed proxima spectator. Lord Francis Bacon, The \nMaxims of the Law, Regula I, in 14 The Works of \nFrancis Bacon 189 (James Spedding et al. eds., 1900). \nARGUMENT \nI.\u0001\nOVEREXTENDING PROXIMATE CAUSE RAISES \nDUE PROCESS CONCERNS \nOverextending \nproximate \ncause \nto \nall \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d consequences of the sale of lawful goods \nwould raise significant constitutional concerns under \nthe Due Process Clause. One of the \u201celementary \nnotions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional \njurisprudence\u201d is \u201cthat a person receive fair notice not \nonly of the conduct that will subject him to \npunishment, but also of the severity of the penalty \nthat a State may impose.\u201d BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. \nGore, 517 U.S. 559, 574 (1996); see also N.C. Dep\u2019t of \nRevenue v. The Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family \nTr., 588 U.S. 262, 268 (2019). This Court has \nexplained \nthat \n\u201c[c]onditioning \nliability \non \nforeseeability \u2026 is hardly a condition at all\u201d because \na \u201cbroad enough view\u201d guarantees that anything \u201cmay \nbe foreseen.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. \n\n4 \n\u0001\n532, 552\u201353 (1994). Extending liability to all possible \ndownstream effects is thus antithetical to that core \ndue-process protection. See also Sinram v. Penn. R. \nCo., 61 F.2d 767, 771 (2d Cir. 1932) (\u201c[F]or we are not \nbound to take thought for all that the morrow may \nbring, even when we should foresee it.\u201d). \nThat each petitioner is \u201ca large corporation \nrather than an impecunious individual does not \ndiminish its entitlement to fair notice\u201d of potential \nliability. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 517 U.S. at 585; cf. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. \n408, 427 (2003) (\u201cThe wealth of a defendant cannot \njustify \nan \notherwise \nunconstitutional \npunitive \ndamages \naward.\u201d). \nWeakening \ncausation \nrequirements creates a risk of liability not for \u201cthe \nconduct that harmed the plaintiff,\u201d but rather for \n\u201cbeing an unsavory individual or business.\u201d State \nFarm, 538 U.S. at 423. The Constitution tolerates no \nsuch thing. \nThis Court has made similar observations in the \ncontext of personal jurisdiction, which \u201crepresents a \nrestriction on judicial power \u2026 as a matter of \nindividual liberty.\u201d Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, \n472 U.S. 797, 807 (1985) (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n702 (1982)). This Court explained that \u201c\u2018foreseeability\u2019 \nalone\u201d has \u201cnever been a sufficient benchmark\u201d to \nsatisfy the requirements of due process. World-Wide \nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295 \n(1980). This Court\u2019s observations about personal \njurisdiction are particularly relevant here because \nmultiple courts, including the First Circuit, view \nproximate cause as a material consideration when \nweighing the minimum contacts necessary for \n\n5 \n\u0001\npersonal jurisdiction under International Shoe Co. v. \nState of Washington, Office of Unemployment \nCompensation & Placement, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). See \nNowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., 94 F.3d 708, 713\u201316 \n(1st Cir. 1996); see also Cambridge Literary Props., \nLtd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. & Co. Kg., \n295 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2002).  \nThis Court has repeatedly articulated a cabined \nand common-sense understanding of proximate cause, \nwhich is consistent with these due process concerns. \nIn 1918, this Court observed that \u201c[t]he general \ntendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is \nnot to go beyond the first step.\u201d S. Pac. Co. v. Darnell-\nTaenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918). The \nCourt has reiterated that standard as applicable to \nthe Interstate Commerce Act,2 the Clayton Act,3 the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \nAct, 4  and the Fair Housing Act. 5  The Court has \nfurther emphasized that proximate cause requires a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268. \nSubsequent harms that are \u201cpurely contingent\u201d on an \nintervening step are \u201ctoo remote.\u201d Id. at 271; Hemi \nGrp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010). \nIn other words, \u201cother, independent, factors\u201d break \nthe causal chain. Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269; see also \n\u0001\n2 S. Pac. Co., 245 U.S. at 533. \n3 Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of \nCarpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 521, 535-37 (1983). \n4 Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 458\u201361 (2006); \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 267\u201368. \n5 Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 202\u201303 \n(2017). \n\n6 \n\u0001\nHemi Grp., 559 U.S. at 11 (\u201cseparate actions carried \nout by separate parties\u201d); Anza, 547 U.S. at 458 \n(\u201cdistinct\u201d actions by the same party). \nThe decision below analogized to Lexmark \nInternational, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., \n572 U.S. 118 (2014), where this Court considered a \nfalse advertising claim under the Lanham Act. \nPet.App.317a. This Court first reaffirmed that an \nalleged harm is \u201c\u2018too remote\u2019\u201d if it \u201cis purely derivative \nof \u2018misfortunes visited upon a third person by the \ndefendant\u2019s acts.\u2019\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (quoting \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268\u201369). Then, this Court \nobserved both that Congress had specifically provided \nfor recovery by commercial entities for the deception \nof their consumers and \u201cthat under common-law \nprinciples, a plaintiff can be directly injured by a \nmisrepresentation even where a third party \u2026 relied \non it.\u201d Id. at 133 (cleaned up). This Court thus held \nplaintiffs \n\u201cordinarily \nmust \nshow \neconomic \nor \nreputational \ninjury \nflowing \ndirectly \nfrom \nthe \ndeception wrought by the defendant\u2019s advertising,\u201d \nwhich \u201coccurs when deception of consumers causes \nthem to withhold trade from the plaintiff.\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added).  \nMexico comes nowhere close to that standard \nhere, making no allegation (let alone a plausible \nallegation) that petitioners manipulated or deceived \nthe multiple intervening actors between gun sales in \nthe United States and cartel violence in Mexico. \n\u201c[T]here must be a terminus somewhere, short of \neternity, at which the second party becomes \nresponsible in lieu of the first.\u201d Petition of Kinsman \nTransit Co., 338 F.2d 708, 722 (2d Cir. 1964) \n(Friendly, J.) (cleaned up). The unwavering theme of \n\n7 \n\u0001\nthese cases is that proximate cause requires a \u201cdirect\u201d \ninjury\u2014i.e., \u201cthe first step\u201d from the allegedly harmful \nconduct. \nII.\u0001 FORESEEABILITY IS A LIMITLESS STANDARD \nTHAT WILL CRIPPLE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED \nSTATES \nThe implications of overextending proximate \ncause cannot be understated. Every industry would be \nsusceptible to claims for catastrophic damages no \nmatter how far removed the allegedly harmful \nconduct. \nState and local governments have already sued \nthe fossil fuel industry for damages based on an \nattenuated theory of increased harms from climate \nchange. See, e.g., City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Sunoco \nLP, 537 P.3d 1173, 1184 (Haw. 2023), petition for cert. \npending, Nos. 23-947, 23-952 (U.S.). Climate litigation \nhas become a cottage industry, with an ever-\nincreasing number of state and local governments \njoining the fray. See, e.g., In re Fuel Indus. Climate \nCases, No. CJC-24-005310 (Cal. Super. Ct. Oct. 08, \n2024); Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico v. Exxon \nMobil Corp., No. SJ2024CV06512 (P.R.

Sept. 17, \n\n9 \n\u0001\n200717, 2007). To the extent these cases claim \ndamages for alleged climate harms, they rest on \nhighly speculative and tenuous causal chains. See, \ne.g., Roger Pielke Jr., Weather Attribution Alchemy, \nAm. Enter. Inst. (Oct. 8, 2024), https://perma.cc/\nWVL2-YPQF. \nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed against \ncompanies that manufacture or sell plastic products, \nseeking damages and injunctive relief for pollution by \nthird parties. See, e.g., New York v. PepsiCo, Inc., No. \n814682/2023 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. dismissed Oct. 31, 2024), \nDoc. No. 36. In a recent decision dismissing claims by \nNew York, the court was emphatic: \nWhile I can think of no reasonable person \nwho does not believe in the imperatives of \nrecycling and being better stewards of our \nenvironment, this does not give rise to \nphantom assertions of liability that do \nnothing to solve the problem that exists. This \nis a purely legislative or executive function to \nameliorate and the judicial system should not \nbe burdened with predatory lawsuits that \nseek to impose punishment while searching \nfor a crime. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed use of the \njudicial system to punish select purported \noffenders for what she believes to be a \nrighteous cause risks transforming the \njudiciary into an arm of the legislature, or at \nthe very least a passive partner in expanding \nduties that strain the bedrock of well-\nestablished law for policy purposes. \nId., Doc. No. 36, at 18\u201319. But the lawsuits keep \ncoming. See, e.g., Ford Cnty. v. \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n96: 20241203153516869_23-114120Amicus20Brief.json (score: 0.429)\nNo. 23-1141 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., ET AL.,  \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS,  \nRespondent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBRIEF OF THE FIREARMS REGULATORY  \nACCOUNTABILITY COALITION, INC.; HILL COUN-\nTRY CLASS 3, LLC D/B/A SILENCER SHOP;  \nNST GLOBAL, LLC D/B/A SB TACTICAL; AND  \nPALMETTO STATE ARMORY, LLC, AS  \nAMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS \n \n \nDecember 3, 2024 \nSTEPHEN J.

(\u201cFRAC\u201d) is a non-profit association working \nto improve business conditions for the firearms indus-\ntry by ensuring the industry receives fair treatment \nunder the law.  FRAC is the premiere national trade \nassociation representing U.S. firearms manufactur-\ners, retailers, importers, and innovators on regulatory \nand legislative issues impacting the firearms industry \nin the United States.  An important part of FRAC\u2019s \nmission is to represent the interests of its members in \nmatters before Congress, the Executive Branch, and \nthe courts.  To that end, FRAC regularly files amicus \ncuriae briefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues \nof concern to the firearms community.  \nHill Country Class 3, LLC d/b/a Silencer Shop \n(\u201cSilencer Shop\u201d) is the largest distributor of silencers \nin the United States.  Through its innovative kiosks \nand network of over 6,000 Powered by Silencer Shop \nDealers, Silencer Shop\u2019s mission is to simplify the \nNFA-buying process for consumers and their local \ndealers.  Silencer Shop is a staunch defender of the \nSecond Amendment, advocating and litigating to em-\npower gun owners and to push back against govern-\nment overreach. \nNST Global, LLC d/b/a SB Tactical (\u201cSB Tactical\u201d) \nwas founded in 2012 by a Marine and Army veteran \nto help wounded combat veterans exercise their Sec-\nond Amendment rights safely.  Today, SB Tactical \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than Amici Curiae or their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nmanufactures and distributes industry-leading fire-\narms accessories, including the Pistol Stabilizing \nBrace\u00ae, that help law-abiding Americans overcome \nphysical challenges and limitations in order to exer-\ncise their constitutional Right to Keep and Bear \nArms.  SB Tactical is committed to defending Second \nAmendment rights and challenging unlawful en-\ncroachments on those rights. \nPalmetto State Armory, LLC (\u201cPSA\u201d), is a manu-\nfacturer of firearms in the United States.  To protect \nagainst infringement of Americans\u2019 Second Amend-\nment rights, PSA\u2019s mission is to maximize freedom.   \nFRAC (on behalf of its members), Silencer Shop, \nSB Tactical, and PSA (\u201cAmici Curiae\u201d) have a strong \ninterest in this case because the decision below pro-\nvides a roadmap for litigants\u2014including foreign sov-\nereigns like Respondent Estados Unidos Mexicanos \n(\u201cMexico\u201d)\u2014to circumvent not only the Right to Keep \nand Bear Arms safeguarded by the Second and Four-\nteenth Amendments but also the very structure of the \nConstitution that protects and vindicates that right.  \nAmici Curiae comply with an extensive regulatory \nframework at both the federal and state level to par-\ntake lawfully in the firearms industry.  Without their \nparticipation, the constitutional Right to Keep and \nBear Arms would be effectively meaningless.  If the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, these law-\nful industry participants face the existential threat of \ndeath-by-litigation pursued by opportunistic plain-\ntiffs who, unable to prevail under the Constitution \nand in the legislative arena, try to enlist the courts to \nregulate by tort liability instead.  Amici Curiae have \na strong interest in ensuring that the Court rejects \nthis blatant evasion of the constitutional order.   \n\n3 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn the American political system, the People\u2019s \nelected representatives have preeminent authority to \nresolve public policy questions through legislation \nwithin constitutional bounds, while the role of the \ncourts is to apply such policy determinations in the \ncases and controversies that come before them.  Here, \nboth Congress and state legislatures have spoken at \nlength regarding the firearms industry, creating an \nextensive statutory framework that strikes a balance \nbetween various policy objectives and the constitu-\ntional right that the industry exists to operationalize.  \nCourts have generally respected that balance and ap-\nplied the law accordingly.   \nBy endorsing Mexico\u2019s transparent attempt to use \nthe courts to bypass the political branches, the First \nCircuit did the opposite.  In doing so, the court ignored \nCongress\u2019s judgment about firearms regulation in the \nUnited States, instead stretching to the breaking \npoint common-law concepts incorporated into the nar-\nrow predicate exception in the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act (\u201cPLCAA\u201d) in order to hold \nthat Mexico\u2019s suit could proceed.  Not only did the \nFirst Circuit err doctrinally, it also overstepped its \nrole in the American political system in a manner that \nthreatens both constitutional rights and national sov-\nereignty.  To rectify these errors, the Court must re-\nverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPOKEN, COURTS \nMUST ABIDE. \nThe primacy of statutory over common law has \nlong been a fundamental tenet of Anglo-American \ngovernance.  In England, the \u201csupreme authority of \n\n4 \nParliament\u201d entailed \u201can unquestionable authority to \ncontrol the Common Law.\u201d  Gist v. Cole, 2 Nott & \nMcC. 456, 462 (S.C. Const. Ct. App. 1820).  Although \nthere was some debate during the Founding about \nwhether British courts could declare \u201cvoid\u201d an act of \nParliament that was deemed contrary to \u201cthe funda-\nmental principles of justice embodied in the common \nlaw\u201d\u2014what in America would become the practice of \njudicial review of the constitutionality of legislation\u2014\nthere was universal recognition that \u201cParliament had \nsupreme authority\u201d to \u201ccorrect the common law \ncourts\u201d as it saw fit.  John F. Stinneford, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cUnusual\u201d: The Eighth Amendment as a \nBar to Cruel Innovation, 102 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1739, \n1779\u201380 (2008).  In other words, \u201cthe authority of par-\nliament was more potent than the common law, and \nmight change, annul or suspend its restrictions, as \nthat body should determine.\u201d  In re Emery, 107 Mass. \n172, 184 (1871); see also Stinneford, supra, at 1779 \n(noting that, in England, \u201cpower flowed downhill, not \nup,\u201d from Parliament to common law courts).  Indeed, \nthe \u201cHigh Court of Parliament\u201d sat directly over the \ncommon-law courts as the ultimate appellate author-\nity.  See United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 518, \n(1972) (\u201cParliament is itself \u2018The High Court of Par-\nliament\u2019\u2014the highest court in the land\u2014and its judi-\ncial tradition better equips it for judicial tasks.\u201d); \nCharles Howard McIlwain, The High Court of Parlia-\nment and Its Supremacy 258 (1910) (\u201cWe have seen \nthat formerly the legislature in England was in real-\nity a court, that legislation was not sharply differen-\ntiated from adjudication.\u201d). \nIn the United States, where the Framers chose to \nsegregate \u201clegislative\u201d and \u201cjudicial\u201d power in distinct \n\n5 \nbranches of government, the principle of legislative \nsupremacy nevertheless served as a lodestar for the \nConstitution\u2019s design.  See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; id., \nart. III, \u00a7 1; see also Jordan E. Pratt, Disregard of Un-\nconstitutional Laws in the Plural State Executive, 86 \nMiss. L.J. 881, 898 (2017) (\u201c[E]very state constitution \ndivides and separates governmental power between \nlegislative, \nexecutive, \nand \njudicial \nbranches.\u201d).  \nWithin constitutional constraints, the federal and \nstate legislatures possess ultimate authority to decide \nthe policies that will govern the American people \nthrough the enactment of laws.  See, e.g., Federalist \nNo. 33 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cWhat is a LEGISLA-\nTIVE power, but a power of making LAWS?\u201d); Im-\nmigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. \n919, 954 (1983) (characterizing \u201clegislative\u201d power as \n\u201cdetermination[] of policy\u201d).  Courts, in turn, resolve \ncases and controversies through the faithful interpre-\ntation and application of those policies embodied in \nthe legislature\u2019s enactments.  The \u201cjudicial function is \nnot to second-guess the policy decisions of the legisla-\nture, no matter how appealing\u201d a court \u201cmay find con-\ntrary rationales,\u201d but, rather, to give effect to those \ndecisions.  Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 \nU.S. 504, 521 (1981).  \u201cWhen judges disregard these \nprinciples,\u201d they \u201cusurp a lawmaking function re-\nserved for the people\u2019s representatives\u201d in the legisla-\nture.  Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President \n& Fellows of Harv. Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 309\u201310 (2023) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).   \nWhile there are circumstances in which it is ap-\npropriate for a court to fashion public policy, see, e.g., \nRogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 461\u201362 (2001) \n\n6 \n(\u201c[C]ommon law courts [enjoy] substantial leeway . . . \nas they engage in the daily task of . . . reevaluating \nand refining [common-law doctrines] as may be nec-\nessary to bring the common law into conformity with \nlogic and common sense.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 \nU.S. 452, 466 (1991) (\u201cThe common law . . . is to be \nderived from the interstices of prior opinions and a \nwell-considered judgment of what is best for the com-\nmunity.\u201d (citing Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common \nLaw 35\u201336 (1881))), the common-law judge \u201clegislates \nonly between gaps,\u201d filling \u201cthe open spaces in the \nlaw . . . without traveling beyond the walls of the in-\nterstices,\u201d Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judi-\ncial Process 113\u201314 (1921); see also S. Pac. Co. v. Jen-\nsen, 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting) \n(\u201c[J]udges do . . . legislate, but they can do so only in-\nterstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular \nmotions.\u201d).  And \u201c[e]ven within the gaps, re-\nstrictions . . . hedge and circumscribe his action,\u201d in-\ncluding \u201cthe duty of adherence to the pervading spirit \nof the law.\u201d  Cardozo, supra, at 113\u201314.  This is all the \nmore true for federal courts, which are \u201ccourts of lim-\nited jurisdiction,\u201d Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. \nof Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994), and may develop \ncommon law in only \u201c\u2018few and restricted\u2019 instances,\u201d \nCity of Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 (1981) \n(quoting Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S. 647, 651 \n(1963)).  Regardless of the court on which he or she \nsits, the common-law judge must always be guided by \nthe \u201cdefault rule\u201d that the \u201clegislative power [is] to \ncreate public policy\u201d and be mindful that \u201cthe judicial \nforum is especially inappropriate for rendering major \npolicy decisions.\u201d  Torres v. JAI Dining Servs. (Phoe-\nnix), Inc., 536 P.3d 790, 799\u2013800, 802 (Ariz. 2023) \n(Bolick, \nJ., \nconcurring) \n(\u201c[T]he \n[historically] \n\n7 \nunfettered judicial development of common law . . . \nwas eventually constrained by \u2018a trend in government \nthat has developed in recent centuries, called democ-\nracy.\u2019\u201d (quoting Antonin G. Scalia, A Matter of Inter-\npretation 7 (1997))).   \nWhen the legislature has spoken, the common-law \njudge is \u201cno longer tasked with advancing public pol-\nicy as [she] see[s] it.\u201d  VCS, Inc. v. Utah Cmty. Bank, \n2012 UT 89, \u00b6 22 (Lee, J.).  That limited authority all \nbut vanishes.  Instead, her task is reduced to \u201cimple-\nment[ing] the particular balance of policies reflected \nin the terms of a statute.\u201d  Id.  It becomes \u201cthe duty of \nthe court to effect the intention of the legislature\u201d ac-\ncording to \u201cthe words which the legislature has em-\nployed to convey it.\u201d  The Paulina, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n52, 60 (1812); accord SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. \n357, 370 (2018).  Where the \u201c[l]egislature has bal-\nanced public policy concerns and chosen a course of \naction, it is not for the court to second-guess its deci-\nsion\u201d but rather give effect to that decision according \nto the \u201cplain language\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d of the enacted \nlaw.  Kain v. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot., 49 N.E.3d 1124, \n1136\u201337 (Mass. 2016); see Amy Coney Barrett, Sub-\nstantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 Bos. U.L. \nRev. 109, 115\u201316 (2010).   \nEspecially in areas of the law fraught with sensi-\ntive public policy implications, courts rightly refrain \nfrom using the common law to go beyond the policy of \nenacted law.  See, e.g., State ex rel. Hunter v. Johnson \n& Johnson, 2021 OK 54, \u00b6\u00b6 38\u201339 (rejecting a \u201cnovel\u201d \ntheory of public nuisance in opioid-related litigation \nbecause of the \u201cpublic policy\u201d implications of the claim \nthat militated in favor of deferring to the \u201cpolicy-\n\n8 \nmaking\u201d branches of government \u201cmore capable than \ncourts to balance the competing interests at play\u201d); \nKramer v. Cath. Charities of Diocese of Fort Wayne-\nSouth Bend, Inc., 32 N.E.3d 227, 235 (Ind. 2015) (de-\nclining to impose \u201cadditional, heightened\u201d tort-law ob-\nligations on the defendant \u201cin excess of statutory re-\nquirements\u201d imposed on it given the significant \u201cde-\ngree of regulation\u201d it was \u201calready subjected [to] by \nstatute\u201d).  This remains true where the legislation in \nquestion does not displace entirely the role of the com-\nmon law; the common-law court must still recognize \nand apply the common law with a view to the \u201cpolicy \nas expressed by the legislature, not its own views of \nthe \u2018best\u2019 policy.\u201d  Borngne ex rel. Hyter v. Chatta-\nnooga-Hamilton Cnty. Hosp. Auth., 671 S.W.3d 476, \n500\u201301 (Tenn. 2023) (Campbell, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nIn short, the \u201cflexibility inherent in the common \nlaw is not a license to engage in unbridled policymak-\ning\u201d\u2014especially not \u201cin areas . . . governed primarily \nby statute rather than common-law rules.\u201d  Id. at 500.  \n\u201cThe Legislature has the power to decide what the \npolicy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its \nwill, however indirectly, that will should be recog-\nnized and obeyed . . . . it is not an adequate discharge \nof duty for courts to . . . go on as before\u201d as if Congress \nhad not spoken.  FTC v. Jantzen, Inc., 386 U.S. 228, \n235 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[T]he \nprimary policymaking power resides, unquestionably, \nin the legislature,\u201d to which the judicial common law-\nmaking power must \u201csubmit.\u201d  Torres, 536 P.3d at \n799\u2013800 (Bolick, J., concurring).   \n\n9 \nII. LEGISLATURES HAVE SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY RE-\nGARDING FIREARMS POLICY. \nAmerican legislatures have entered the field of \nfirearms policy with gusto, regulating Petitioners, \nAmici Curiae, and other industry participants in \nspades.  The laws enacted as a result represent a con-\nscientious balancing of various policy considerations \nagainst the constitutional backdrop of the Second and \nFourteenth Amendments.  The development of fire-\narms policy through common-law doctrines is neces-\nsarily cabined by these enactments, and any applica-\ntion of such doctrines must be guided by them.   \nAt the federal level, Congress has been making \nfirearms policy since the Nation\u2019s founding.  The Mi-\nlitia Act of May 8, 1792, for example, required large \nsegments of the population to \u201cprovide [themselves] \nwith a good musket or firelock.\u201d  See Militia Act of \nMay 8, 1792, ch. 33, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. 271, 27\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n36: 20240522141844434_23-114120Amicus20Brief.json (score: 0.428)\nNos. 23-1141 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n______________________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS INC., ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n______________________ \nBRIEF OF AMICI CURIAE  \nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  \nMANUFACTURERS AND  \nAMERICAN TORT REFORM ASSOCIATION  \nIN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS  \n______________________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit \n______________________ \nPhilip S.

They and their members are concerned with \nattempts to subject industries that manufacture law-\nful products to unprincipled liability for costs of soci-\netal problems regardless of whether any of their con-\nduct proximately caused those alleged harms. \nThe NAM is the largest manufacturing associa-\ntion in the United States, representing small and \nlarge manufacturers in all 50 states and every indus-\ntrial sector. Manufacturing employs nearly 13 mil-\nlion men and women, contributes $2.89 trillion to the \nUnited States economy annually, has the largest \neconomic impact of any major sector, and accounts \nfor over half of all private-sector research and devel-\nopment in the nation. The NAM is the voice of the \nmanufacturing community and leading advocate for \na policy agenda and liability laws that help manufac-\nturers compete in the global economy and create jobs \nacross the United States. \nATRA is a broad-based coalition of businesses, \ncorporations, municipalities, associations, and pro-\nfessional firms that have pooled their resources to \npromote reform of the civil justice system with the \ngoal of ensuring fairness, balance, and predictability \nin civil litigation. For more than three decades,  \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for amici affirm this brief was \nnot authored in whole or in part by counsel for any party and \nthat no person or entity, other than amici curiae, their mem-\nbers, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to the \npreparation or submission of the brief. Counsel of record for all \nparties received timely notice of the intention to file this brief.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \nATRA has filed amicus briefs in cases involving im-\nportant liability issues.  \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct (PLCAA), Congress requires a showing that a \nfirearms manufacturer is the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of \nharm for which a plaintiff seeks relief in order for the \nplaintiff to proceed on the claim. This requirement \nincorporates from tort law traditional notions of \nproximate cause that have served to protect manu-\nfacturers engaged in lawful commerce from unprin-\ncipled liability over their products. Thus, although \nthis case arises in the context of firearms, the First \nCircuit\u2019s erroneous holding on proximate causation \nhas implications for the manufacture and sale of \nmany lawful products that have inherent risks relat-\ned to their use and misuse. Indeed, comparable law-\nsuits that have sought to force manufacturers and \nsellers of lawful products\u2014such as lead paint, pre-\nscription medicines, and beverages in plastic bot-\ntles\u2014to pay for state and local government efforts to \ndeal with risks consumers created with the lawfully \nsold products (lead poisoning, drug abuse and litter).  \nFor at least three reasons, the Court should grant \nthe petition to correct the First Circuit\u2019s decision. \nFirst, the court found that foreseeability alone could \nsatisfy proximate cause, creating a circuit split. See \nEstados Unidos Mexicanos v. Smith & Wesson \nBrands, Inc., 91 F.4th 511, 534 (1st Cir. 2024). In \n2002, an American government brought similar alle-\ngations as those here, and the Third Circuit dis-\nmissed the case. It held that proximate causation re-\nquires \u201ca direct relation between the injury asserted \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nand the injurious conduct alleged,\u201d and the govern-\nment did not establish proximate cause between sell-\ning a lawful product and the public safety concerns \nover how some consumers used the product. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n423 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Holmes v. Securities In-\nvestor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268-69 (1992)).  \nSecond, the court did not require Respondent to \nidentify any specific sales of the Petitioners\u2019 products \nthat foreseeably caused the alleged harms. See Esta-\ndos Unidos Mexicanos, 91 F.4th at 532 (\u201cOf course, \nthe complaint does not allege defendants\u2019 awareness \nof any particular unlawful sale.\u201d). Rather, Respond-\nent pleaded foreseeability in aggregated generalities, \narguing that engaging in commerce of a product that \ncauses known harms satisfies proximate cause when \nthese harms occur\u2014regardless of how attenuated \nfrom the manufacturers and sellers. And third, the \ncomplaint seeks to impose joint and several liability \non an industry for a broad range of expenses rather \nthat than establish that a manufacturer\u2019s conduct \ncaused any of the specific harms alleged. \nAmerican liability law, when grounded in proxi-\nmate causation, does not impose blame or obligations \nfor product-based societal harms on industries that \nput those lawful products into the stream of com-\nmerce. It may be foreseeable, for example, that un-\nderage individuals will purchase alcoholic beverages, \ncausing harm to themselves, their parents, or others, \nbut manufacturers and sellers of wine, beer and \nspirts are not liable for these harms. See, e.g., Alston \nv. Advanced Brands & Importing Co., 494 F.3d 562, \n565 (6th Cir. 2007). Similarly, it is foreseeable that \nsome people will become obese or develop diabetes \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \nfrom certain foods, but companies that sell those \nfoods are not liable for these conditions. Pelman v. \nMcDonald's Corp., 237 F. Supp.2d 512, 538 (S.D.N.Y. \n2003). Otherwise, there would be no just stopping \npoint. Many social issues related to products may be \nforeseeable in a general, aggregated sense. But, \nthere are no specific incidents of harm that are prox-\nimately caused by the manufacturers or sellers of \nthose products. In fact, these harms are often caused \nby acts\u2014including unlawful acts\u2014of third parties. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s formulation of proximate cau-\nsation cannot stand; it violates the basic tenets of the \nAmerican civil justice system. Rather than subject \ndefendants to liability for harm they actually caused, \nwhich is the essence of American tort law, these law-\nsuits will be used to generate revenue for local and \nstate governments, regardless of fault, and overtake \nfederal or state regulatory regimes that take consid-\nerable care to manage public risks associated with \nlawful economic activity. Here, a foreign country is \nusing this litigation to do both. Denying this petition, \ntherefore, could invite foreign governments to sue \nAmerican companies for a wide-variety of social con-\nditions. Such lawsuits could destabilize the American \neconomy and generate lawfare designed to hinder the \ncompetitiveness of American manufacturers. This \ncase could also inspire new speculative domestic law-\nsuits against manufacturers of lawful products. \nFor these reasons, as discussed in detail below, \namici urge the Court to grant the Petition and hold \nthat proximate cause cannot be satisfied here by the \nacts of manufacturing, selling, and marketing lawful \nproducts, including products with known, foreseeable \nrisks. There is no doubt that gun violence, just like \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \nlead poisoning, litter, and drunk driving, are critical \npublic health and safety matters. But, these facts \nalone should not give rise to deep pocket jurispru-\ndence against market participants that did not prox-\nimately cause the harms alleged. \nARGUMENT \nI. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT THE PETI-\nTION TO REAFFIRM THAT FORESEEABIL-\nITY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROXI-\nMATE CAUSATION \nProximate causation is \u201cfundamental\u201d to Ameri-\ncan tort law and \u201cappl[ies] in any kind of case,\u201d Dan \nB. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 180, at 443 n.2 (2001), \nincluding this one where liability centers on whether \na legal violation is the \u201cproximate cause of the harm \nfor which relief is sought,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThe purpose of requiring a showing of proximate \ncause is to \u201climit liability even where the fact of cau-\nsation is clearly established,\u201d including where manu-\nfacturers put products into the stream of commerce \nthat can cause harm, but the harms are not proxi-\nmately caused by the manufacturers. Prosser & \nKeeton on Torts 273 (5th ed. 1984). There must be a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268-\n69. The specific injury the plaintiff sustained must \nbe the type of injury that a reasonable person would \nsee as a likely result of specific acts of misconduct. \nAs this Court has held, \u201cforeseeability alone does \nnot ensure the close connection that proximate cause \nrequires.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, Fla., \n581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017). Foreseeability is a neces-\nsary, but not sufficient element of proximate cause. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nConduct \u201ccannot meaningfully be viewed as \u2018wrong\u2019 if \nthe actor could not possibly have contemplated that \nthe action might produce the harm.\u201d David G. Owen, \nFiguring Foreseeability, 44 Wake Forest L. Rev. \n1277, 1277-78 (2009). There are some harms that \nmay flow downstream from a defendant\u2019s acts, but \nare too remote from these acts to satisfy proximate \ncausation. See Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Wel-\nfare Fund v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 921 \n(3d Cir. 1999) (recognizing \u201can injury that is too re-\nmote from its causal agent fails to satisfy tort law\u2019s \nproximate cause requirement\u201d); see also Holmes, 503 \nU.S. at 268-69 (discussing the remoteness doctrine). \nConsider what is probably the most famous tort \ncase, Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R., in which Judge \nCardozo found that a railroad was not liable for an \ninjury that occurred as a result of a sequence of \nevents that began with a railroad employee pushing \na passenger carrying a small package into a depart-\ning train., 162 N.E. 99, 99 (N.Y. 1928). It may have \nbeen foreseeable that the employee\u2019s action could re-\nsult in the pushed passenger falling and experienc-\ning an injury or the package dropping, resulting in \nproperty \ndamage. \nBut \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \ninjury\u2014\ntriggered by a fireworks explosion from the dropped \npackage that ended in a weighing scale tipping over \nand hitting a passenger far down the platform\u2014was \nsimply too many steps removed from the employee\u2019s \nconduct for the railroad to be legally responsible for \nthat person\u2019s harm. Whether viewed as a decision \nrooted in duty or proximate causation, foreseeability \nthat some harm will be caused is not sufficient to es-\ntablish proximate cause for all downstream injuries. \nThe direct relationship between the alleged miscon-\nduct and specific harms asserted was missing. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \nIndeed, the California Supreme Court has recog-\nnized the legal predicament of over-relying on fore-\nseeability to justify liability, albeit under the element \nof duty. See Dillon v. Legg, 441 P.2d 912 (Cal. 1968) \n(allowing liability for reasonably foreseeable emo-\ntional harm). After foreseeability ceased to provide \nany meaningful bounds to liability, the court re-\nstrained its expansive doctrine, famously observing \nthat \u201cthere are clear judicial days on which a court \ncan foresee forever and thus determine liability but \nnone on which that foresight alone provides a social-\nly and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of dam-\nages for that injury.\u201d Thing v. La Chusa, 771 P.2d \n814, 830 (Cal. 1989). Applying a \u201cpure foreseeability\u201d \ntest in such cases, the court continued, had failed to \nappreciate \u201cthe importance of avoiding the limitless \nexposure to liability.\u201d Id. at 821. In such instances, \n\u201cforeseeability\u201d was \u201cnot a realistic indicator of po-\ntential liability\u201d and did \u201cnot afford a rational limita-\ntion on recovery.\u201d Id. at 826. \nIn cases such as the one here, proximate cause \nprovides this \u201cnecessary limitation on liability.\u201d Exx-\non Co. v. SOFEC, Inc., 517 U.S. 830, 838 (1996). \nWithout the constraint of proximate cause, tort law \nwould \u201cproduce extreme results,\u201d because \u201c[i]n a \nphilosophical sense, the consequences of an act go \nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go \nback to the dawn of human events, and beyond.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, su-\npra, at 264). \u201cSomewhere a point will be reached \nwhen courts will agree that the link has become too \ntenuous.\u201d Id. (quoting Petition of Kinsman Transit \nCo., 338 F.2d 708, 725 (2d Cir. 1964)); accord \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J. concurring) (\u201cLife \nis too short to pursue every human act to its most \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \nremote consequences; \u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d). \nHere, Congress sought to ensure that such tenu-\nous liability could not be used in this context, ex-\npressly stating that liability in cases such as this one \nrequires the defendants to violate the law and this \nviolation to be the \u201cproximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThe legislative intent could not be clearer. Congress \nenacted the PLCAA to stop a rash of cases similar to \nthe one here. State and local governments in the \nUnited States sought to subject this industry to the \nsame types of damages. Most of these cases failed, \nincluding on proximate causation grounds. See, e.g., \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1114-16 (Ill. 2004) (\u201c[W]e do not intend to min-\nimize the very real problem of violent crime and the \ndifficult tasks facing law enforcement and other pub-\nlic officials,\u201d but liability law does not allow a cause \nof action \u201cso broad and undefined that the presence \nof any potentially dangerous instrumentality in the \ncommunity could be deemed to\u201d invoke it.). But, \nsome succeeded. See City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1141 (Ohio 2002). \nCongress stated in the PLCAA that it enacted the \nlaw to ensure these companies would not be held lia-\nble for \u201charm caused by those who criminally or un-\nlawfully misuse\u201d their products. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). \nThis context makes this case an important one for \nthe Court to hear. In the two decades since City of \nChicago and City of Cincinnati were heard, many \nother industries have been sued to pay costs associ-\nated with unlawful uses of lawful products. The \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \nCourt should grant the petition to ensure that prox-\nimate causation continues to distinguish between (a) \ntortious acts that directly cause harm, from (b) man-\nufacturing, selling and promoting lawful products. \nTortious acts are often considered intervening causes \nthat \u201coccur after the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d and cut-off \nproximate causation. John L. Diamond, Cases and \nMaterials on Torts 256 (2001). Case law recognizes \nthat a party \u201cmay reasonably proceed upon the as-\nsumption that others will obey the criminal law,\u201d \nKeeton, supra, at 305, even though \u201cthere are bad \npeople in society who do bad things.\u201d Stahlecker v. \nFord Motor Co., 667 N.W.2d 244, 251 (Neb. 2003).  \nIn individual cases, where plaintiffs seek to sub-\nject manufacturers to liability for criminal acts of \nothers, the lack of proximate causation has been de-\nterminative in dismissing claims. In Stahlecker, a \nperson alleged that the manufacturer of her vehicle \nand tire could be subject to liability after a defective \ntire stranded her at night in a remote location, ex-\nposing her to risk of harm. See id. But, these compa-\nnies are not the proximate cause of injuries caused \nby criminals who harm stranded drivers merely be-\ncause the companies sold car parts that failed. See \nid. at 259 (finding criminal acts of third parties were \nan \u201cintervening cause which necessarily defeats \nproof of the essential element of proximate cause\u201d).  \nIndeed, in many of the industry-wide cases where \nlocal and state governments have sued manufactur-\ners and sellers of products over downstream risks of \nproducts, individuals first attempted to bring per-\nsonal injury claims against these companies. Those \ncases were not successful because the individuals in \nthe cases could not establish that the companies \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \nproximately caused them harm based on a tortfea-\nsor\u2019s independent actions. See Santiago v. Sherwin \nWilliams Co., 3 F.3d 546, 550 (1st Cir. 1993) (recog-\nnizing that proximate cause subjects defendants to \nliability \u201conly for the harm they have caused\u201d and \nseparates \u201ctortfeasors from innocent actors.\u201d). Prox-\nimate cause requires much greater specificity.  \nCases such as the one at bar attempt to overcome \nthis void and individual burdens of proof by substi-\ntuting governments as plaintiffs and seeking deriva-\ntive costs. They suggest it is foreseeable that selling \ncertain products and engaging in certain lawful \nsales, when aggregated, will lead to criminal activity \nand cause governments to spend resources dealing \nwith that criminal activity. Proximate causation does \nnot become clearer, though, by pulling back the cau-\nsation lens to the level of blurred generalities.  \nThe Court should grant the petition to clarify that \nforeseeability of general conditions associated with \nsales of certain products does not esta\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Eliot, The Love Song of J.

AmFree\u2019s members are vitally interested in \nU.S energy security and the continued viability of our \ncommercial republic. Shortly after its founding, \nAmFree launched the Center for Legal Action (\u201cCLA\u201d) \nto represent these interests in court. CLA is \nspearheaded by two-time former U.S. Attorney \nGeneral Bill Barr. \nAmFree submits this brief because the decision \nbelow is not just wrong, but would also have a \ncrippling effect on American industry and would \ndilute the constitutional requirement that \u201cNo person \nshall \u2026 be deprived of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCan the flutter of a butterfly\u2019s wing result in a \nnatural disaster on another continent? Edward N. \nLorenz, The Essence of Chaos 179 (1993). Or if the \nbutterfly \ndies, \ndoes \nits \ndemise \nchange \nthe \ndevelopment of the English language? Or the outcome \nof a presidential election? Cf. Ray Bradbury, A Sound \nof Thunder (1952). These are interesting questions for \nphilosophers, science fiction writers, and poets to \nponder. And while we may then wonderlike \n\u0001\n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and \nno person or entity other than amicus or its counsel made a \nmonetary contribution intended to fund its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n2 \n\u0001\nPrufrock\u2014\u201cDo I dare / Disturb the universe? \u2026. Do I \ndare to eat a peach?\u201d T.S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. \nAlfred Prufrock (1915)\u2014no one actually lives that \nway. And, until recently, no one would expect to find \nsuch \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d theories invading the forensic \ninquiries of judges and juries: \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a \nkingdom was lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the \nstatement of a major cause of action against a \nblacksmith.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 287 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nMexico begs to differ. It fears its kingdom will be \nlost\u2014not for want of a nail\u2014but for want of draconian \ngun laws in its neighbor to the north. And so it comes \nbefore this Court, asking it to all but erase the \ntraditional causation requirements of tort law. The \nresult would be chaos. That this Court must resolve \nwhether gun sales in the United States\u2014in whatever \nform\u2014are the proximate cause of cartel violence in \nMexico is alarming evidence that such litigation is out \nof control. \nAmicus writes to underscore three points. First, \noverextending proximate cause is incompatible with \ndue process. This Court has repeatedly reiterated the \nclose causal nexus necessary for liability and should \nreaffirm that now. \nSecond, foreseeability is an unbounded and \nunwieldy standard that hangs the sword of unlimited \nliability over the head of all American businesses \n(except for judgment-proof fly-by-night enterprises). \nEntire industries that supply the necessities of \neveryday life and sustain the economy could easily fall \nvictim to the same proximate-cause analysis. \n\n3 \n\u0001\nThird, each additional step in a causal chain \nallows foreign sovereigns to reach further beyond \ntheir borders and act as de facto policymakers in the \nUnited \nStates. \nNuisance \nlitigation \nbased \non \nattenuated \ncausation \nhas \nalready \nfrayed \nthe \nrelationship between the several States of the union, \nand adding foreign sovereigns to the mix will only \nmake matters worse. \n* * * \nFrancis Bacon was right: In jure non remota \ncausa, sed proxima spectator. Lord Francis Bacon, The \nMaxims of the Law, Regula I, in 14 The Works of \nFrancis Bacon 189 (James Spedding et al. eds., 1900). \nARGUMENT \nI.\u0001\nOVEREXTENDING PROXIMATE CAUSE RAISES \nDUE PROCESS CONCERNS \nOverextending \nproximate \ncause \nto \nall \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d consequences of the sale of lawful goods \nwould raise significant constitutional concerns under \nthe Due Process Clause. One of the \u201celementary \nnotions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional \njurisprudence\u201d is \u201cthat a person receive fair notice not \nonly of the conduct that will subject him to \npunishment, but also of the severity of the penalty \nthat a State may impose.\u201d BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. \nGore, 517 U.S. 559, 574 (1996); see also N.C. Dep\u2019t of \nRevenue v. The Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family \nTr., 588 U.S. 262, 268 (2019). This Court has \nexplained \nthat \n\u201c[c]onditioning \nliability \non \nforeseeability \u2026 is hardly a condition at all\u201d because \na \u201cbroad enough view\u201d guarantees that anything \u201cmay \nbe foreseen.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. \n\n4 \n\u0001\n532, 552\u201353 (1994). Extending liability to all possible \ndownstream effects is thus antithetical to that core \ndue-process protection. See also Sinram v. Penn. R. \nCo., 61 F.2d 767, 771 (2d Cir. 1932) (\u201c[F]or we are not \nbound to take thought for all that the morrow may \nbring, even when we should foresee it.\u201d). \nThat each petitioner is \u201ca large corporation \nrather than an impecunious individual does not \ndiminish its entitlement to fair notice\u201d of potential \nliability. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 517 U.S. at 585; cf. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. \n408, 427 (2003) (\u201cThe wealth of a defendant cannot \njustify \nan \notherwise \nunconstitutional \npunitive \ndamages \naward.\u201d). \nWeakening \ncausation \nrequirements creates a risk of liability not for \u201cthe \nconduct that harmed the plaintiff,\u201d but rather for \n\u201cbeing an unsavory individual or business.\u201d State \nFarm, 538 U.S. at 423. The Constitution tolerates no \nsuch thing. \nThis Court has made similar observations in the \ncontext of personal jurisdiction, which \u201crepresents a \nrestriction on judicial power \u2026 as a matter of \nindividual liberty.\u201d Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, \n472 U.S. 797, 807 (1985) (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n702 (1982)). This Court explained that \u201c\u2018foreseeability\u2019 \nalone\u201d has \u201cnever been a sufficient benchmark\u201d to \nsatisfy the requirements of due process. World-Wide \nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295 \n(1980). This Court\u2019s observations about personal \njurisdiction are particularly relevant here because \nmultiple courts, including the First Circuit, view \nproximate cause as a material consideration when \nweighing the minimum contacts necessary for \n\n5 \n\u0001\npersonal jurisdiction under International Shoe Co. v. \nState of Washington, Office of Unemployment \nCompensation & Placement, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). See \nNowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., 94 F.3d 708, 713\u201316 \n(1st Cir. 1996); see also Cambridge Literary Props., \nLtd. v. W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik G.m.b.H. & Co. Kg., \n295 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2002).  \nThis Court has repeatedly articulated a cabined \nand common-sense understanding of proximate cause, \nwhich is consistent with these due process concerns. \nIn 1918, this Court observed that \u201c[t]he general \ntendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is \nnot to go beyond the first step.\u201d S. Pac. Co. v. Darnell-\nTaenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918). The \nCourt has reiterated that standard as applicable to \nthe Interstate Commerce Act,2 the Clayton Act,3 the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \nAct, 4  and the Fair Housing Act. 5  The Court has \nfurther emphasized that proximate cause requires a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268. \nSubsequent harms that are \u201cpurely contingent\u201d on an \nintervening step are \u201ctoo remote.\u201d Id. at 271; Hemi \nGrp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010). \nIn other words, \u201cother, independent, factors\u201d break \nthe causal chain. Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269; see also \n\u0001\n2 S. Pac.

Static Control Components, Inc., \n572 U.S. 118 (2014), where this Court considered a \nfalse advertising claim under the Lanham Act. \nPet.App.317a. This Court first reaffirmed that an \nalleged harm is \u201c\u2018too remote\u2019\u201d if it \u201cis purely derivative \nof \u2018misfortunes visited upon a third person by the \ndefendant\u2019s acts.\u2019\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (quoting \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268\u201369). Then, this Court \nobserved both that Congress had specifically provided \nfor recovery by commercial entities for the deception \nof their consumers and \u201cthat under common-law \nprinciples, a plaintiff can be directly injured by a \nmisrepresentation even where a third party \u2026 relied \non it.\u201d Id. at 133 (cleaned up). This Court thus held \nplaintiffs \n\u201cordinarily \nmust \nshow \neconomic \nor \nreputational \ninjury \nflowing \ndirectly \nfrom \nthe \ndeception wrought by the defendant\u2019s advertising,\u201d \nwhich \u201coccurs when deception of consumers causes \nthem to withhold trade from the plaintiff.\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added).  \nMexico comes nowhere close to that standard \nhere, making no allegation (let alone a plausible \nallegation) that petitioners manipulated or deceived \nthe multiple intervening actors between gun sales in \nthe United States and cartel violence in Mexico. \n\u201c[T]here must be a terminus somewhere, short of \neternity, at which the second party becomes \nresponsible in lieu of the first.\u201d Petition of Kinsman \nTransit Co., 338 F.2d 708, 722 (2d Cir. 1964) \n(Friendly, J.) (cleaned up). The unwavering theme of \n\n7 \n\u0001\nthese cases is that proximate cause requires a \u201cdirect\u201d \ninjury\u2014i.e., \u201cthe first step\u201d from the allegedly harmful \nconduct. \nII.\u0001 FORESEEABILITY IS A LIMITLESS STANDARD \nTHAT WILL CRIPPLE INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED \nSTATES \nThe implications of overextending proximate \ncause cannot be understated. Every industry would be \nsusceptible to claims for catastrophic damages no \nmatter how far removed the allegedly harmful \nconduct. \nState and local governments have already sued \nthe fossil fuel industry for damages based on an \nattenuated theory of increased harms from climate \nchange. See, e.g., City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Sunoco \nLP, 537 P.3d 1173, 1184 (Haw. 2023), petition for cert. \npending, Nos. 23-947, 23-952 (U.S.).

Sept. 17, \n\n9 \n\u0001\n200717, 2007). To the extent these cases claim \ndamages for alleged climate harms, they rest on \nhighly speculative and tenuous causal chains. See, \ne.g., Roger Pielke Jr., Weather Attribution Alchemy, \nAm. Enter. Inst. (Oct. 8, 2024), https://perma.cc/\nWVL2-YPQF. \nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed against \ncompanies that manufacture or sell plastic products, \nseeking damages and injunctive relief for pollution by \nthird parties. See, e.g., New York v. PepsiCo, Inc., No. \n814682/2023 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. dismissed Oct. 31, 2024), \nDoc. No. 36. In a recent decision dismissing claims by \nNew York, the court was emphatic: \nWhile I can think of no reasonable person \nwho does not believe in the imperatives of \nrecycling and being better stewards of our \nenvironment, this does not give rise to \nphantom assertions of liability that do \nnothing to solve the problem that exists. This \nis a purely legislative or executive function to \nameliorate and the judicial system should not \nbe burdened with predatory lawsuits that \nseek to impose punishment while searching \nfor a crime. Plaintiff\u2019s proposed use of the \njudicial system to punish select purported \noffenders for what she believes to be a \nrighteous cause risks transforming the \njudiciary into an arm of the legislature, or at \nthe very least a passive partner in expanding \nduties that strain the bedrock of well-\nestablished law for policy purposes. \nId., Doc. No. 36, at 18\u201319. But the lawsuits keep \ncoming. See, e.g., Ford Cnty. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., No. \n2:24-cv-2547 (D. Kan. filed Nov. 27, 2024); California \n\n10 \n\u0001\nv.

Even non-governmental organizations have \njoined the litigation. See, e.g., Sierra Club, Inc. v. \nExxon Mobil Corp., No. CGC24618321 (Cal. Super. Ct. \nfiled Sept. 23, 2024); Earth Island Inst. v. Crystal \nGeyser Water Co., No. 20CIV01213 (Cal. Super. Ct. \nfiled Feb. 26, 2020).. \nWho\u2019s next? According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, there were 5,930,496 motor vehicle \ncrashes in the United States in 2022. Motor Vehicle \nSafety Data, Bureau of Transp. Statistics, U.S. Dep\u2019t \nof \nTransp., \nhttps://www.bts.gov/content/motor-\nvehicle-safety-data (last accessed Dec. 2, 2024) (Table \n2-17). It is thus entirely foreseeable that non-defective \nvehicles will be involved in accidents, including as a \nresult of driver error, recklessness, and the influence \nof drugs or alcohol. It is also entirely foreseeable that \nsome cars will be used in shootings and robberies. The \ndecision below would designate the entire automobile \nindustry as a proximate cause of these harms. \nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(\u201cFBI\u201d), \u201cblunt object[s]\u201d like baseball bats, clubs, and \nhammers are the seventh-most common weapons in \nviolent offenses in the United States. Crime Data \nExplorer, \nFBI, \nhttps://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/\nwebapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend \n(last \naccessed Dec. 2, 2024) (tbl. \u201cAll Violent Offenses \nOffense Characteristics: Type of Weapon Involved By \nOffense\u201d). With nearly a quarter-million violent \ncrimes committed with blunt objects over the last 5 \n\n11 \n\u0001\nyears, id., it would be hard to argue that Louisville \nSlugger\u2014which puts 1.8 million baseball bats into \ninterstate commerce every year, Frequently Asked \nQuestions, Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, \nhttps://perma.cc/4MRX-XFUM (last accessed Dec. 2, \n2024)\u2014does not know that at least some of their bats \nwill be used for violent purposes. By the same token, \nHome Depot sells $12.1 billion worth of tools every \nyear. The Home Depot, Inc., Annual Report (Form 10-\nK), at 51 (Mar. 13, 2024), https://perma.cc/S4CK-\nUBB3. This extensive revenue, representing a full 8% \nof the company\u2019s net sales, id., includes commerce in \nhand tools like hammers, wrenches, flashlights, and \ncrowbars. \nThe FBI also reports that men commit nearly \n70% of violent crimes. Crime Data Explorer, FBI, \nsupra (Table \u201cAll Violent Offenses Offender vs. Victim \nDemographics: Sex\u201d). Despite this publicly available \ninformation\u2014from \nan \nofficial \nsource\u2014Louisville \nSlugger and Home Depot take no precautions to \nensure \ntheir \ndangerous \nweapons \naren\u2019t \nsold, \ndistributed, or gifted to these disproportionately \ndangerous users. Even worse, Louisville Slugger and \nHome Depot actively market their goods to that \ndemographic.

Louisville Slugger \nand Home Depot can\u2019t escape the decision below, \neither. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, \ncybercrime has created annual domestic damages of \n\n12 \n\u0001\nas much as $4 billion. Cybercrime, U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, \nhttps://perma.cc/9X8B-B6ZW (last accessed Dec. 2, \n2024). The top 6 computer manufacturers\u2014Lenovo, \nHP, Dell, Apple, Asus, and Acer\u2014combine to capture \n85.9% of the global market in personal computers. \nGartner, Press Release, Gartner Says Worldwide PC \nShipments Increased 0.3% in Fourth Quarter of 2023 \nBut Declined 14.8% for the Year 2\u20133 tbl. 3 (Jan. 10, \n2024), https://perma.cc/T5JV-6FYU. At least some of \nthose machines would foreseeably be used in the \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of cybercrimes \ncommitted every year in the United States. FBI, 2023 \nInternet Crime Report (2024), https://perma.cc/E5UY-\nS36B. Yet, despite that severity of this issue, these \ncompanies appear to be making no serious effort to \nprevent their products from reaching the hands of \npotential criminals. \nThe list goes on and on. There is no principle to \nthe decision below that would limit liability to guns. \nWith an unbounded conception of \u201cproximate cause,\u201d \nplaintiffs could make allegations similar to Mexico\u2019s \nthat each respective defendant should have created a \nsystem to \u201csupervise\u201d downstream sales (\u00b6 264), \nenforce \nbackground \nchecks \non \n(primary \nand) \nsecondary sales (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369b), and create \u201canti-theft \nmeasures\u201d to mitigate the harms from stolen goods \n(\u00b6 269). Pet.App.83a\u201384a, 89a\u201390a, 132a. \nThis Court has before it similar questions about \nforeseeability and proximate causation that for \ndecades have bedeviled federal actions subject to \nenvironmental \nreview \nunder \nthe \nNational \nEnvironmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d). See Seven Cnty. \nInfrastructure Coal. v. Eagle Cnty., No. 23-975 (U.S. \n2024). In the NEPA context, lower courts have \n\n13 \n\u0001\nwrestled with how to apply this Court\u2019s holding that \nagencies need only to consider environmental effects \nwhen the agency is the \u201clegally relevant \u2018cause\u2019 of the \neffect.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, \n770 (2004). Given the tendency of many lower courts \nto, instead, apply \u201ca particularly unyielding variation \nof \u2018but for\u2019 causation,\u201d id. at 767, plaintiffs\u2014limited \nonly by their imaginations\u2014have used NEPA to \ntransform \nevery \nfederal \nagency \ninto \nan \n\u201cenvironmental-policy czar,\u201d Ctr. for Biological \nDiversity v.

Circuit \nopinion under review that faults a federal agency for \nfailing to consider the effect of a rail line in Utah on \nenvironmental justice communities in Louisiana. \nEagle Cnty. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 82 F.4th 1152, \n1177\u201380 (D.C. Cir. 2023). The continuous application \nof such an unbounded view of what constitutes a \n\u201clegally relevant \u2018cause,\u2019\u201d Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n770, imposes immeasurable uncertainty on any \nproject subject to any sort of federal approval, which \nmust survive the gauntlet of NEPA and subsequent \njudicial review. Extensive NEPA reviews\u2014and the \nuncertainty of litigation\u2014have delayed projects for \nyears (if not indefinitely), led to hundreds of millions  \nof dollars in increased costs for individual projects, \nand caused investors to avoid interstate ventures \naltogether. Brief of the Interstate Natural Gas Ass\u2019n \nof America et al. as Amici Curiae in Support of \nPetitioners at 11\u201313, Eagle Cnty., No. 23-975 (U.S. \nSept. 4, 2024). \n\n14 \n\u0001\nMexico is attempting to use litigation in the \nUnited States to resolve its own domestic issues or \notherwise circumvent negotiation with the President \nover a matter of foreign affairs. Cf. United States v. \nCurtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 319 (1936) \n(\u201cThe President is the sole organ of the nation in its \nexternal relations, and its sole representative with \nforeign nations.\u201d). If Mexico succeeds (or if States and \nlocal governments similarly prevail) in expanding \nproximate cause, it will take little time for other \nplaintiffs to come knocking, with no end in sight. The \nresult of overextending proximate cause would be \ndevastating. \nIII.\u0001 EACH ADDITIONAL STEP IN A CAUSAL CHAIN \nALLOWS SOVEREIGNS \nTO REACH FURTHER \nBEYOND THEIR BORDERS \nIn our federal system, no State \u201ccan legislate for, \nor impose its own policy upon the other.\u201d Kansas v. \nColorado, 206 U.S. 46, 95 (1907); see also State Farm, \n538 U.S. at 422 (\u201c[E]ach State may make its own \nreasoned judgment about what conduct is permitted \nor proscribed within its borders.\u201d); BMW of N. Am., \nInc., 517 U.S. at 571\u201373 (\u201c[I]t is clear that no single \nState could \u2026 impose its own policy choice on \nneighboring States.\u201d); cf. World-Wide Volkswagen \nCorp., 444 U.S. at 294 (explaining \u201cthe Due Process \nClause\u201d can be \u201can instrument of interstate \nfederalism\u201d). \nNevertheless, each additional step allowed in a \ncausal chain increases the ability of a State to use \nlitigation to reach across its borders and impose its \npreferences on its neighbors. Cf. Kurns v. R.R. \nFriction Prods. Corp., 565 U.S. 625, 637 (2012) (\u201c[T]he \n\n15 \n\u0001\nobligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is \ndesigned to be, a potent method of governing conduct \nand controlling policy.\u201d (quoting San Diego Bldg. \nTrades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 247 (1959))); \nMinnesota v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 63 F.4th 703, 719 \n(8th Cir. 2023) (Stras, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he state\u2019s \nattempt to set national energy policy through its own \nconsumer-protection laws would \u2018effectively override \n\u2026 the policy choices made by\u2019 the federal government \nand other states.\u201d (quoting Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Ouellette, \n479 U.S. 481, 495 (1987))). That\u2019s the point. Suits like \nthis one, claims by state and local governments \nagainst energy companies and plastic manufacturers, \nand many others aim to use tort law to obtain policy \nchange beyond what can be achieved through the \npolitical process. See David A. Dana, Public Nuisance \nLaw When Politics Fails, 83 Ohio St. L.J. 61 (2022). \nAttenuated causation also requires broader relief to \nremedy\u2014such as public nuisance claims that demand \ndamages based on global conduct and require \nequitable relief of an international scope to abate\u2014\nonly makes matters worse. \nIt is thus unsurprising that overextending \nproximate cause is fraying the relationship between \nthe States. Indeed, States have increasingly used \nnuisance litigation to try and force their policy \npreferences on their neighbors or otherwise try and \nobtain what they cannot achieve through Congress. \nRecently, nineteen States filed a motion for leave \nto bring an original action in this Court against \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, and \nRhode Island. Alabama v. California, No. 22O158 \n(U.S. 2024). The defendant States there have sued \nmajor energy companies for damages and injunctive \n\n16 \n\u0001\nrelief related to harms allegedly attributable to \nclimate change caused by emissions from use of their \nproducts. The motion claimed those efforts, which \nseek damages for global conduct and corresponding \nequitable remedies, violate horizontal federalism. \nMaine recently joined the defendant States in suing \nmajor energy companies for alleged climate harms, \nfurther deepening the divide. See Maine v. BP P.L.C., \nNo. ___, (Me. Super. Ct. filed Nov. 26, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/9NGM-9N23; \nsee \nalso \nStephen \nSinger, Maine Sues Energy Companies, Saying They \nFailed to Warn About Climate Change, Portland Press \nHerald (Nov. 26, 2024), https://perma.cc/VG9C-\nJNUH. \nThe decision below adds foreign sovereigns to the \nmix. Mexico is seeking to impose joint and several \nliability on each petitioner for cartel violence in \nMexico, and to ban all sales of disfavored guns, as \nnecessary to remedy its alleged harms. That would \ninevitably extend Mexico\u2019s preferred gun policy into \nthe United States. Worse still, Mexico is seeking to \ndraw billions of dollars from the U.S. economy\u2014\nenough to entirely bankrupt firearm manufactures\u2014\nto fund its own domestic, governmental operations \nlike paying for a police force, all without showing \ndirect causation to specific sales. Petitioners will \npresumably be liable based on their alleged market \nshare, then jointly liable for any remaining balance. \nThat\u2019s an attempt to tax on American companies and \nconsumers to fund the Mexican government, see \ngenerally George L. Priest, The Deep Contradiction \nBetween \nProduct \nLiability \nand \nMarket \nShare \nLiability, Yale L. & Econ. Rsch. Paper (drft.

Priest, Market Share Liability in \n\n17 \n\u0001\nPersonal Injury and Public Nuisance Litigation: An \nEconomic Analysis, 18 Sup. Ct. Econ. Rev. 109 (2010), \nsomething \nMexico \nwould \notherwise \nhave \nno \njurisdiction to pursue. \nTo accomplish these goals, Mexico sought out a \nfavorable forum with favorable state law. It is no \nwonder that twenty-six other states and the Arizona \nLegislature filed an amicus brief asking this Court to \nreverse the decision below, decrying the expansion of \nproximate cause and Mexico\u2019s attempt to export its \npolicy to the United States. See Brief for the State of \nMontana, 25 Other States, and the Arizona \nLegislature as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioner \nand Reversal, No. 23-1141 (U.S. May 21, 2024). \n* * * \n \nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. All of these \nproblems can be avoided by applying the standard for \nproximate cause that has worked for the last century, \nif not longer. \n\n18 \n\u0001\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse. \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nWILLIAM P.

(\u201cFRAC\u201d) is a non-profit association working \nto improve business conditions for the firearms indus-\ntry by ensuring the industry receives fair treatment \nunder the law.  FRAC is the premiere national trade \nassociation representing U.S. firearms manufactur-\ners, retailers, importers, and innovators on regulatory \nand legislative issues impacting the firearms industry \nin the United States.  An important part of FRAC\u2019s \nmission is to represent the interests of its members in \nmatters before Congress, the Executive Branch, and \nthe courts.  To that end, FRAC regularly files amicus \ncuriae briefs in cases, like this one, that raise issues \nof concern to the firearms community.  \nHill Country Class 3, LLC d/b/a Silencer Shop \n(\u201cSilencer Shop\u201d) is the largest distributor of silencers \nin the United States.  Through its innovative kiosks \nand network of over 6,000 Powered by Silencer Shop \nDealers, Silencer Shop\u2019s mission is to simplify the \nNFA-buying process for consumers and their local \ndealers.  Silencer Shop is a staunch defender of the \nSecond Amendment, advocating and litigating to em-\npower gun owners and to push back against govern-\nment overreach. \nNST Global, LLC d/b/a SB Tactical (\u201cSB Tactical\u201d) \nwas founded in 2012 by a Marine and Army veteran \nto help wounded combat veterans exercise their Sec-\nond Amendment rights safely.  Today, SB Tactical \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than Amici Curiae or their counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nmanufactures and distributes industry-leading fire-\narms accessories, including the Pistol Stabilizing \nBrace\u00ae, that help law-abiding Americans overcome \nphysical challenges and limitations in order to exer-\ncise their constitutional Right to Keep and Bear \nArms.  SB Tactical is committed to defending Second \nAmendment rights and challenging unlawful en-\ncroachments on those rights. \nPalmetto State Armory, LLC (\u201cPSA\u201d), is a manu-\nfacturer of firearms in the United States.  To protect \nagainst infringement of Americans\u2019 Second Amend-\nment rights, PSA\u2019s mission is to maximize freedom.   \nFRAC (on behalf of its members), Silencer Shop, \nSB Tactical, and PSA (\u201cAmici Curiae\u201d) have a strong \ninterest in this case because the decision below pro-\nvides a roadmap for litigants\u2014including foreign sov-\nereigns like Respondent Estados Unidos Mexicanos \n(\u201cMexico\u201d)\u2014to circumvent not only the Right to Keep \nand Bear Arms safeguarded by the Second and Four-\nteenth Amendments but also the very structure of the \nConstitution that protects and vindicates that right.  \nAmici Curiae comply with an extensive regulatory \nframework at both the federal and state level to par-\ntake lawfully in the firearms industry.  Without their \nparticipation, the constitutional Right to Keep and \nBear Arms would be effectively meaningless.  If the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision is allowed to stand, these law-\nful industry participants face the existential threat of \ndeath-by-litigation pursued by opportunistic plain-\ntiffs who, unable to prevail under the Constitution \nand in the legislative arena, try to enlist the courts to \nregulate by tort liability instead.  Amici Curiae have \na strong interest in ensuring that the Court rejects \nthis blatant evasion of the constitutional order.   \n\n3 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn the American political system, the People\u2019s \nelected representatives have preeminent authority to \nresolve public policy questions through legislation \nwithin constitutional bounds, while the role of the \ncourts is to apply such policy determinations in the \ncases and controversies that come before them.  Here, \nboth Congress and state legislatures have spoken at \nlength regarding the firearms industry, creating an \nextensive statutory framework that strikes a balance \nbetween various policy objectives and the constitu-\ntional right that the industry exists to operationalize.  \nCourts have generally respected that balance and ap-\nplied the law accordingly.   \nBy endorsing Mexico\u2019s transparent attempt to use \nthe courts to bypass the political branches, the First \nCircuit did the opposite.  In doing so, the court ignored \nCongress\u2019s judgment about firearms regulation in the \nUnited States, instead stretching to the breaking \npoint common-law concepts incorporated into the nar-\nrow predicate exception in the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act (\u201cPLCAA\u201d) in order to hold \nthat Mexico\u2019s suit could proceed.  Not only did the \nFirst Circuit err doctrinally, it also overstepped its \nrole in the American political system in a manner that \nthreatens both constitutional rights and national sov-\nereignty.  To rectify these errors, the Court must re-\nverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPOKEN, COURTS \nMUST ABIDE. \nThe primacy of statutory over common law has \nlong been a fundamental tenet of Anglo-American \ngovernance.  In England, the \u201csupreme authority of \n\n4 \nParliament\u201d entailed \u201can unquestionable authority to \ncontrol the Common Law.\u201d  Gist v. Cole, 2 Nott & \nMcC. 456, 462 (S.C. Const. Ct. App. 1820).  Although \nthere was some debate during the Founding about \nwhether British courts could declare \u201cvoid\u201d an act of \nParliament that was deemed contrary to \u201cthe funda-\nmental principles of justice embodied in the common \nlaw\u201d\u2014what in America would become the practice of \njudicial review of the constitutionality of legislation\u2014\nthere was universal recognition that \u201cParliament had \nsupreme authority\u201d to \u201ccorrect the common law \ncourts\u201d as it saw fit.  John F. Stinneford, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cUnusual\u201d: The Eighth Amendment as a \nBar to Cruel Innovation, 102 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1739, \n1779\u201380 (2008).  In other words, \u201cthe authority of par-\nliament was more potent than the common law, and \nmight change, annul or suspend its restrictions, as \nthat body should determine.\u201d  In re Emery, 107 Mass. \n172, 184 (1871); see also Stinneford, supra, at 1779 \n(noting that, in England, \u201cpower flowed downhill, not \nup,\u201d from Parliament to common law courts).  Indeed, \nthe \u201cHigh Court of Parliament\u201d sat directly over the \ncommon-law courts as the ultimate appellate author-\nity.  See United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 518, \n(1972) (\u201cParliament is itself \u2018The High Court of Par-\nliament\u2019\u2014the highest court in the land\u2014and its judi-\ncial tradition better equips it for judicial tasks.\u201d); \nCharles Howard McIlwain, The High Court of Parlia-\nment and Its Supremacy 258 (1910) (\u201cWe have seen \nthat formerly the legislature in England was in real-\nity a court, that legislation was not sharply differen-\ntiated from adjudication.\u201d). \nIn the United States, where the Framers chose to \nsegregate \u201clegislative\u201d and \u201cjudicial\u201d power in distinct \n\n5 \nbranches of government, the principle of legislative \nsupremacy nevertheless served as a lodestar for the \nConstitution\u2019s design.  See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; id., \nart. III, \u00a7 1; see also Jordan E. Pratt, Disregard of Un-\nconstitutional Laws in the Plural State Executive, 86 \nMiss. L.J. 881, 898 (2017) (\u201c[E]very state constitution \ndivides and separates governmental power between \nlegislative, \nexecutive, \nand \njudicial \nbranches.\u201d).  \nWithin constitutional constraints, the federal and \nstate legislatures possess ultimate authority to decide \nthe policies that will govern the American people \nthrough the enactment of laws.  See, e.g., Federalist \nNo. 33 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cWhat is a LEGISLA-\nTIVE power, but a power of making LAWS?\u201d); Im-\nmigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. \n919, 954 (1983) (characterizing \u201clegislative\u201d power as \n\u201cdetermination[] of policy\u201d).  Courts, in turn, resolve \ncases and controversies through the faithful interpre-\ntation and application of those policies embodied in \nthe legislature\u2019s enactments.  The \u201cjudicial function is \nnot to second-guess the policy decisions of the legisla-\nture, no matter how appealing\u201d a court \u201cmay find con-\ntrary rationales,\u201d but, rather, to give effect to those \ndecisions.  Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 \nU.S. 504, 521 (1981).  \u201cWhen judges disregard these \nprinciples,\u201d they \u201cusurp a lawmaking function re-\nserved for the people\u2019s representatives\u201d in the legisla-\nture.  Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President \n& Fellows of Harv. Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 309\u201310 (2023) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).   \nWhile there are circumstances in which it is ap-\npropriate for a court to fashion public policy, see, e.g., \nRogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 461\u201362 (2001) \n\n6 \n(\u201c[C]ommon law courts [enjoy] substantial leeway . . . \nas they engage in the daily task of . . . reevaluating \nand refining [common-law doctrines] as may be nec-\nessary to bring the common law into conformity with \nlogic and common sense.\u201d); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 \nU.S. 452, 466 (1991) (\u201cThe common law . . . is to be \nderived from the interstices of prior opinions and a \nwell-considered judgment of what is best for the com-\nmunity.\u201d (citing Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common \nLaw 35\u201336 (1881))), the common-law judge \u201clegislates \nonly between gaps,\u201d filling \u201cthe open spaces in the \nlaw . . . without traveling beyond the walls of the in-\nterstices,\u201d Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judi-\ncial Process 113\u201314 (1921); see also S. Pac. Co. v. Jen-\nsen, 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting) \n(\u201c[J]udges do . . . legislate, but they can do so only in-\nterstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular \nmotions.\u201d).  And \u201c[e]ven within the gaps, re-\nstrictions . . . hedge and circumscribe his action,\u201d in-\ncluding \u201cthe duty of adherence to the pervading spirit \nof the law.\u201d  Cardozo, supra, at 113\u201314.  This is all the \nmore true for federal courts, which are \u201ccourts of lim-\nited jurisdiction,\u201d Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. \nof Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994), and may develop \ncommon law in only \u201c\u2018few and restricted\u2019 instances,\u201d \nCity of Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313 (1981) \n(quoting Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S. 647, 651 \n(1963)).  Regardless of the court on which he or she \nsits, the common-law judge must always be guided by \nthe \u201cdefault rule\u201d that the \u201clegislative power [is] to \ncreate public policy\u201d and be mindful that \u201cthe judicial \nforum is especially inappropriate for rendering major \npolicy decisions.\u201d  Torres v. JAI Dining Servs. (Phoe-\nnix), Inc., 536 P.3d 790, 799\u2013800, 802 (Ariz. 2023) \n(Bolick, \nJ., \nconcurring) \n(\u201c[T]he \n[historically] \n\n7 \nunfettered judicial development of common law . . . \nwas eventually constrained by \u2018a trend in government \nthat has developed in recent centuries, called democ-\nracy.\u2019\u201d (quoting Antonin G. Scalia, A Matter of Inter-\npretation 7 (1997))).   \nWhen the legislature has spoken, the common-law \njudge is \u201cno longer tasked with advancing public pol-\nicy as [she] see[s] it.\u201d  VCS, Inc. v. Utah Cmty. Bank, \n2012 UT 89, \u00b6 22 (Lee, J.).  That limited authority all \nbut vanishes.  Instead, her task is reduced to \u201cimple-\nment[ing] the particular balance of policies reflected \nin the terms of a statute.\u201d  Id.  It becomes \u201cthe duty of \nthe court to effect the intention of the legislature\u201d ac-\ncording to \u201cthe words which the legislature has em-\nployed to convey it.\u201d  The Paulina, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n52, 60 (1812); accord SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. \n357, 370 (2018).  Where the \u201c[l]egislature has bal-\nanced public policy concerns and chosen a course of \naction, it is not for the court to second-guess its deci-\nsion\u201d but rather give effect to that decision according \nto the \u201cplain language\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d of the enacted \nlaw.  Kain v. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot., 49 N.E.3d 1124, \n1136\u201337 (Mass. 2016); see Amy Coney Barrett, Sub-\nstantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 Bos. U.L. \nRev. 109, 115\u201316 (2010).   \nEspecially in areas of the law fraught with sensi-\ntive public policy implications, courts rightly refrain \nfrom using the common law to go beyond the policy of \nenacted law.  See, e.g., State ex rel. Hunter v. Johnson \n& Johnson, 2021 OK 54, \u00b6\u00b6 38\u201339 (rejecting a \u201cnovel\u201d \ntheory of public nuisance in opioid-related litigation \nbecause of the \u201cpublic policy\u201d implications of the claim \nthat militated in favor of deferring to the \u201cpolicy-\n\n8 \nmaking\u201d branches of government \u201cmore capable than \ncourts to balance the competing interests at play\u201d); \nKramer v. Cath. Charities of Diocese of Fort Wayne-\nSouth Bend, Inc., 32 N.E.3d 227, 235 (Ind. 2015) (de-\nclining to impose \u201cadditional, heightened\u201d tort-law ob-\nligations on the defendant \u201cin excess of statutory re-\nquirements\u201d imposed on it given the significant \u201cde-\ngree of regulation\u201d it was \u201calready subjected [to] by \nstatute\u201d).  This remains true where the legislation in \nquestion does not displace entirely the role of the com-\nmon law; the common-law court must still recognize \nand apply the common law with a view to the \u201cpolicy \nas expressed by the legislature, not its own views of \nthe \u2018best\u2019 policy.\u201d  Borngne ex rel. Hyter v. Chatta-\nnooga-Hamilton Cnty. Hosp. Auth., 671 S.W.3d 476, \n500\u201301 (Tenn. 2023) (Campbell, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \nIn short, the \u201cflexibility inherent in the common \nlaw is not a license to engage in unbridled policymak-\ning\u201d\u2014especially not \u201cin areas . . . governed primarily \nby statute rather than common-law rules.\u201d  Id. at 500.  \n\u201cThe Legislature has the power to decide what the \npolicy of the law shall be, and if it has intimated its \nwill, however indirectly, that will should be recog-\nnized and obeyed . . . . it is not an adequate discharge \nof duty for courts to . . . go on as before\u201d as if Congress \nhad not spoken.  FTC v. Jantzen, Inc., 386 U.S. 228, \n235 (1967) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201c[T]he \nprimary policymaking power resides, unquestionably, \nin the legislature,\u201d to which the judicial common law-\nmaking power must \u201csubmit.\u201d  Torres, 536 P.3d at \n799\u2013800 (Bolick, J., concurring).   \n\n9 \nII. LEGISLATURES HAVE SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY RE-\nGARDING FIREARMS POLICY. \nAmerican legislatures have entered the field of \nfirearms policy with gusto, regulating Petitioners, \nAmici Curiae, and other industry participants in \nspades.  The laws enacted as a result represent a con-\nscientious balancing of various policy considerations \nagainst the constitutional backdrop of the Second and \nFourteenth Amendments.  The development of fire-\narms policy through common-law doctrines is neces-\nsarily cabined by these enactments, and any applica-\ntion of such doctrines must be guided by them.   \nAt the federal level, Congress has been making \nfirearms policy since the Nation\u2019s founding.  The Mi-\nlitia Act of May 8, 1792, for example, required large \nsegments of the population to \u201cprovide [themselves] \nwith a good musket or firelock.\u201d  See Militia Act of \nMay 8, 1792, ch. 33, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. 271, 271\u201372 (1792).  \nCongress mandated firearm ownership to ensure that \nthe militia\u2014i.e., at the time, \u201cthose who were male, \nable bodied, and within a certain age range\u201d\u2014was \narmed and ready for service if called upon.  District of \nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 580 (2008).    \nStarting in the twentieth century, the federal gov-\nernment took a more active role in regulating the sale \nand transfer of firearms.  Through the Revenue Act of \n1918, Congress imposed a 10% excise tax on the first-\ntime sale of firearms and ammunition.  See Pub. L. \nNo. 65-254, \u00a7 900(10), 40 Stat. 1057, 1122 (1919).  \nThen, in 1927, Congress enacted its \u201cfirst purely crim-\ninal firearms law\u201d in the Mailing of Firearms Act, \nBrandon E. Beck, The Federal War on Guns: A Story \nin Four-and-a-Half Acts, 26 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 53, 63 \n\n10 \n(2023), which prohibited the mailing of \u201cpistols, re-\nvolvers, and other [small] firearms,\u201d Pub. L. No. 69-\n583, 44 Stat. 1059, 1059\u201360 (1927).   \nThose initial, discrete measures set the table for \nthe National Firearms Act of 1934 (\u201cNFA\u201d), \u201cthe first \ncomprehensive federal foray into firearms regula-\ntion.\u201d  Beck, supra, at 65 (citing Pub. L. No. 73-474, \n48 Stat. 1236 (1934)).  Congress passed the NFA un-\nder the auspices of its taxing power to impose regis-\ntration, recordkeeping, and taxation requirements on \nthe manufacture, sale, and transfer of certain fire-\narms associated with organized crime.  Id. at 65 n.69 \n(internal quotation marks omitted); Franklin E. Zim-\nring, Firearms and Federal Law: The Gun Control Act \nof 1968, 4 J. Leg. Studies 133, 138 (1975).  Among \nother things, the NFA regulated firearms design, see, \ne.g., NFA \u00a7 1(a) (including within the law\u2019s scope \nshort-barreled rifles and machine guns), and required \ncovered firearms to be stamped with an \u201cidentifica-\ntion mark\u201d that the NFA made unlawful to remove, \nid. \u00a7 8(a)\u2013(b).  The NFA notably put the federal gov-\nernment for the first time \u201cin the business of licensing \nmanufacturers and dealers of firearms.\u201d  Zimring, su-\npra, at 139. \nCongress\u2019s next major regulatory effort came soon \nthereafter with the passage of the Federal Firearms \nAct of 1938.  Pub. L. No. 75-785, 52 Stat. 1250 (1938).  \nBuilding on the NFA\u2019s licensing scheme, the Federal \nFirearms Act expanded the range of firearm designs \nregulated by federal law to include pistols and revolv-\ners, id. \u00a7 1(3); generally prohibited unlicensed manu-\nfacturers and dealers from engaging in the firearms \nand ammunition trade, id. \u00a7 2(a)\u2013(b); made it illegal \n\n11 \nfor manufacturers and dealers to transfer firearms to \nanyone not properly licensed in accordance with the \nlaws of the purchaser\u2019s state, id. \u00a7 2(c); made it illegal \nto transfer covered firearms or ammunition to several \nstatus-based categories of persons, id. \u00a7 2(d)\u2013(f); and \nmade it illegal to transfer a firearm whose serial num-\nber was \u201cremoved, obliterated, or altered,\u201d id. \u00a7 2(i).  \nThree decades later, in the face of \u201cgrowing rates \nof gun crime, increases in the importation of cheap in-\nternational firearms, general civil unrest, and specific \nviolent acts of national importance,\u201d Congress again \nwaded into the field of firearms policy, most notably \nwith the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\u201cGCA\u201d).  Beck, su-\npra, at 70\u201371, 76 (citing Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub. \nL. No. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213 (1968)).  Amending then-\nextant federal firearms laws \u201cto provide for better con-\ntrol of the interstate traffic in firearms,\u201d GCA at 1213, \nthe GCA generally expanded the existing federal \nframework of taxation, licensure, and recordkeeping, \nincluding by requiring manufacturers to stamp on \neach firearm a \u201cserial number which may not be read-\nily removed, obliterated, or altered,\u201d GCA \u00a7 201; in-\ncreased the reach of federal law to include new cate-\ngories of persons to whom firearms could not be trans-\nferred; and created new federal firearms crimes.  See \nBeck, supra, at 77 (summarizing these changes).  De-\nmonstrably aware of the constitutionally fraught pol-\nicy balancing it was engaged in, Congress included an \nexpress statement in the GCA, noting simultaneously \nthat its purpose was to support the \u201cfight against \ncrime and violence\u201d but was not to \u201cplace any undue \nor unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on \nlaw-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, \n\n12 \npossession, or use of firearms . . . for lawful purposes.\u201d  \nGCA \u00a7 101.   \nIn 1986, Congress enacted the Firearms Owners\u2019 \nProtection Act (\u201cFOPA\u201d), yet another legislative bal-\nancing act that reduced firearms regulations in some \nrespects but increased them in others, albeit all with \na view to \u201ccorrect[ing] existing firearms statutes and \nenforcement policies\u201d in order to protect the constitu-\ntional right \u201cto keep and bear arms.\u201d  See FOPA, Pub. \nL. No. 99-308, \u00a7 1(b)(1)(A), 100 Stat. 449, 449 (1986); \nsee generally David T. Hardy, The Firearms Owners\u2019 \nProtection Act: A Historical and Legal Perspective, 17 \nCumb. L. Rev. 585, 588\u201389 (1987) (summarizing and \nexamining the \u201ccomplex series of compromises\u201d FOPA \nembodied).  In 1988, Congress addressed the topic of \nweapons design once more, banning firearms \u201cunde-\ntectable\u201d by metal detectors or x-ray machines.  Un-\ndetectable Firearms Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-649, \n\u00a7 2, 102 Stat. 3816, 3816 (1988).  In 1993, Congress \nimposed mandatory waiting periods on the transfer of \nfirearms and required federally licensed manufactur-\ners and dealers to conduct background checks before \nmost retail firearms transfers.  See generally Brady \nHandgun Violence Prevention Act, Pub. L. No. 103-\n159, 107 Stat. 1536 (1993).  In 1994, Congress decided \nto ban numerous firearm designs (designs constitut-\ning what it dubbed \u201csemiautomatic assault weap-\nons\u201d), though it conscientiously made the ban effec-\ntive for only ten years and let it expire without re-\nnewal in 2004.  See Public Safety and Recreational \nFirearms Use Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 103-322, Tit. \nXI, Subtit.  A, \u00a7\u00a7 110101\u201306, 108 Stat. 1796, 1996\u2013\n2010 (1994); Vivian S. Chu, Federal Assault Weapons \n\n13 \nBan: Legal Issues 3 & n.25, Cong. Rsch. Serv. (Feb. \n14, 2013).   \nCongress has continued to regulate the firearms \nindustry, including Amici Curiae, since the turn of the \ncentury.  Just two years ago, for example, Congress \nenacted the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act \nthat, among other things, criminalized unequivocally \nthe straw purchase of firearms; criminalized particu-\nlar acts concerning firearms trafficking; and explicitly \nprohibited the federal government from transferring \nfirearms or ammunition to drug-cartel agents.  See \nPub. L. No. 117-159, Tit. II, \u00a7 12004(a)(1), (g), 136 \nStat. 1313, 1326\u201327 (2022).  And, in 2005, Congress \nenacted the PLCAA expressly to prevent suits like \nthis one, see Pet. Br. 2, 5\u201311, 31, that \u201cattempt to use \nthe judicial branch to circumvent the Legislative \nbranch of government to regulate interstate and for-\neign commerce\u201d related to firearms \u201cthrough judg-\nments and judicial decrees\u201d instead of bicameralism \nand presentment.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). \nThe vast regulatory regime Congress has estab-\nlished, of course, is not limited to what appears in the \nUnited States Code.  Administrative agencies\u2014most \nprominently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-\narms and Explosives (ATF)\u2014issue countless regula-\ntions construing and applying firearms statutes, \nwhich carry \u201cthe \u2018force and effect of law.\u2019\u201d  Perez v. \nMortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (quoting \nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302\u201303 \n(1979)).  Members of the industry must take care to \nmaneuver this regulatory maze, lest they face severe \ncivil or criminal penalties.  See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 \n(ten years\u2019 imprisonment and $10,000 fine for NFA \n\n14 \nviolation).  Agency adjudications and informal guid-\nance add to the already monumental regulatory bur-\nden with which the public is expected to comply.  See \nCity of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 313 (2013) \n(Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (\u201c\u2018[T]he administrative \nstate with its reams of regulations would leave [the \nFramers] rubbing their eyes.\u2019\u201d (first alteration in orig-\ninal) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 807 \n(1999) (Souter, J., dissenting))). \nBut that is not all.  \u201cWhile extensive federal legis-\nlation is devoted to firearm regulation, the vast ma-\njority\u201d of such regulations \u201cexist at the state and local \nlevel.\u201d  Ben Howell, Note, Come and Take It: The Sta-\ntus of Texas Handgun Legislation After District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 61 Baylor L. Rev. 215, 216\u201317 \n(2009).  These laws vary widely across the states and \nrun the gamut of related subjects.  See generally Ste-\nphen P. Halbrook, Firearms Law Deskbook, app. A, \nWestlaw (Updated Oct. 2024) (collecting and summa-\nrizing firearms regulations from each state).  Given \nthis variety, unsurprisingly, state laws address eve-\nrything from design and manufacturing standards, \ndistribution and transfer of guns, and marketing of \nfirearms.  See id.; accord Giffords Law Center to Pre-\nvent Gun Violence, Browse State Gun Laws, \nhttps://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/browse-state-\ngun-laws/.  \nSuffice to say, the regulatory regime governing the \nmanufacture, sale, and possession of firearms is a be-\nhemoth.  As the PLCAA notes, the industry is among \nthe most \u201cheavily regulated\u201d in the Nation.  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(4).  To engage in the manufacture and sale \nof firearms, Amici Curiae consequently expend \n\n15 \ntremendous amounts of time, effort, and resources to \nensure compliance with federal and state law.  For ex-\nample, Amici Curiae submit newly designed weapons \nfor ATF review and classification\u2014a process that, at \ntimes, takes years.  See, e.g., Firearms Regul. Ac-\ncountability Coal., Inc. v. Garland, No. 1:23-cv-00003 \n(D.N.D. filed Jan. 4, 2023) (FRAC member still await-\ning ATF action necessary to sell firearm submitted for \nclassification in 2017).  They must carefully maintain \nFederal Firearms Licenses to engage in the sale of \nregulated firearms.  And they are subjected to regular \ninspections by federal officials, who ensure exacting \ncompliance with the myriad regulations governing \nthe storage and transfer of firearms.  In short, this is \nnot an unregulated industry; Congress and the States \nhave not sat idly by.  They have legislated exhaust-\nively, and Amici Curiae incur a substantial burden \nnavigating the carefully crafted regulatory regime \ngoverning this industry.      \nIII. \nCONGRESS AND THE STATES HAVE LEFT NO \nROOM \nFOR \nMEXICO \nTO \nREGULATE \nTHE \nAMERICAN FIREARMS INDUSTRY THROUGH TORT \nLAW. \nThe vast array of statutes governing firearms in \nthe United States has left no room for judicial policy-\nmaking.  To the extent \u201cinterstices\u201d remain, courts \nmust act with extreme humility, paying heed to \u201cthe \npervading spirit\u201d of legislative enactments.  Cardozo, \nsupra, at 113\u201314.   \nThe First Circuit has not.  Purporting to apply \n\u201ctraditional understandings of proximate cause\u201d \ngiven the predicate exception\u2019s incorporation of a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement, Pet. App. 309a\u2013310a, \n\n16 \n310a n.8.; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii), the First Cir-\ncuit instead adopted an expansive \u201cforeseeability\u201d \nstandard, Pet. App. 309a\u2013319a, stretching its com-\nmon-law meaning beyond recognition to encompass \nMexico\u2019s hyper-attenuated theory of causation, see \nPet. Br. 17\u201331 (explaining why the First Circuit\u2019s \nproximate-causation analysis cannot be squared with \nthe doctrine as traditionally understood at common \nlaw).  In doing so, the First Circuit ran roughshod over \nnot only the text of the PLCAA itself, but the wealth \nof federal and state statutes governing the firearms \nindustry.  And in the process, it empowered a foreign \nsovereign to set new policy via judicial fiat at odds \nwith that established by the American people through \ntheir elected representatives in Congress and the \nStates. \nA. Statutory Law Precludes Mexico\u2019s At-\ntempt To Regulate The American Fire-\narms Industry.  \nThe First Circuit applied a capacious \u201cforeseeabil-\nity\u201d standard to the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement in order to justify allowing this suit to pro-\nceed.  Pet. App. 309a\u2013319a.  And Mexico defends that \napproach by relying on the \u201cflexible\u201d nature of proxi-\nmate causation at common law.  See Opp. Cert. 19 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).  But even granting \nMexico\u2019s premise\u2014which is flawed\u2014in this context, \nproximate causation is necessarily rigorous. \nFirst, the First Circuit\u2019s decision is at war with the \ntext of the PLCAA itself.  When incorporated into a \nfederal statutory scheme, \u201c[p]roximate-cause analysis \nis controlled by the nature\u201d of that statutory scheme, \nLexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., \n\n17 \n572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014); Blue Shield of Va. v. \nMcCready, 457 U.S. 465, 477 n.13 (1982) (\u201clegislative \nintent is the controlling consideration\u201d), and the un-\nambiguous intent of the PLCAA is to prohibit suits of \nthis sort, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a) (\u201cA qualified civil li-\nability action may not be brought in any Federal or \nState court.\u201d).  Congress unambiguously explained \nthat its intent was to prevent lawsuits against those \nlawfully engaged in the American firearms industry \nbased on the harm caused by third parties \u201cwho crim-\ninally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or am-\nmunition products that function as designed and in-\ntended.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  To declare \u201cforesee-\nable\u201d (and thus actionable in tort) such misuse contra-\nvenes Congress\u2019s explicit, codified legislative intent in \nthe PLCAA to bar lawsuits on this basis.  \nThe predicate exception in the PLCAA cannot be \nconstrued to allow through the backdoor what the \nPLCAA bars at the front.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nWhere, as here, a \u201cgeneral statement of policy is qual-\nified by an exception,\u201d the exception is to be read \u201cnar-\nrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of \nthe provision.\u201d  Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue v. Clark, \n489 U.S. 726, 739 (1989); see also Quarles v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. 645, 654 (2019) (\u201cWe should not \nlightly conclude that Congress enacted a self-defeat-\ning statute.\u201d).  To do otherwise would \u201cabuse the in-\nterpretive process\u201d and \u201cfrustrate the announced will \nof the people,\u201d allowing a court to \u201ceviscerate\u201d the \u201cleg-\nislative judgment\u201d by an unduly expansive construc-\ntion of the text viewed in isolation.  Clark, 489 U.S. at \n739 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This princi-\nple applies with full force here.  See, e.g., City of New \nYork v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 524 F.3d 384, 391, 403 \n\n18 \n(2d Cir. 2008) (rejecting a \u201cfar too-broad reading of the \npredicate exception\u201d that would \u201cswallow the stat-\nute\u201d).  \u201cProximate cause\u201d in the PLCAA is rigorous, \nrequiring far more than the capacious \u201cforeseeability\u201d \nstandard adopted by the First Circuit.  Mexico\u2019s tort \naction cannot serve as a vehicle for circumventing the \nclear intent of the statute, as expressed in its text.   \nSecond, even if the PLCAA itself did not clearly \nforeclose the First Circuit\u2019s expansion of proximate \ncause, the vast regulatory regime governing the in-\ndustry in which Amici Curiae operate unquestionably \ndid.  Given the reams of statutes on the subject of fire-\narms in the United States, see supra, the application \nof common-law doctrine to the predicate exception\u2019s \nproximate-cause requirement must be circumspect, \nlest the court disrupt those policies established by the \nPeople\u2019s representatives.  Other courts to consider \nsuits like Mexico\u2019s have recognized as much.   \nFor instance, in the face of a \u201ccomprehensive stat-\nutory and regulatory scheme\u201d governing the firearms \nindustry, the New York Court of Appeals declined to \nadopt a \u201cnovel theory\u201d of tort liability advanced by \nanti-gun plaintiffs, instead leaving any such \u201cfunda-\nmental changes in the industry . . . to the appropriate \nlegislative and regulatory bodies.\u201d  Hamilton v. \nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 750 N.E.2d 1055, 1060, 1068 \n(N.Y. 2001) (reciting and agreeing with the defend-\nants\u2019 arguments); accord People ex rel. Spitzer v. \nSturm, Ruger & Co., 761 N.Y.S.2d 192, 203 (N.Y. App. \nDiv. 2003) (\u201c[T]he problems to which plaintiff\u2019s com-\nplaint alludes are presently the subject of strict con-\ntrol and regulation by the Executive and Legislative \nbranches of both the United States and New York \n\n19 \nState governments. . . . their resolution is best left to \nthe Legislative and Executive branches.\u201d).  Facing a \nsimilar theory of liability in a related case, the Illinois \nSupreme Court turned it away, recognizing that \n\u201c[a]ny change of this magnitude in the law affecting a \nhighly regulated industry must be the work of the leg-\nislature, brought about by the political process, not \nthe work of [common-law] courts.\u201d  City of Chicago v. \nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1148 (Ill. \n2004).  Likewise, the District of Columbia Court of Ap-\npeals was \u201cunwilling[] to relax basic \u2018liability-limiting\u2019 \nstandards . . . of duty, foreseeability, and causal re-\nmoteness\u201d to recognize expansive common-law claims \nasserted by the plaintiffs in another anti-gun lawsuit, \naffirming the dismissal of those claims in \u201cdeference \nto the legislative role\u201d and in light of the legislature\u2019s \nenactment of statutes \u201cprecisely in th[e] area\u201d of fire-\narms policy.  District of Columbia v. Beretta, U.S.A., \nCorp., 872 A.2d 633, 645 (D.C. 2005).  And applying \nPennsylvania law, a federal district court in that state \ndeclined to recognize a broad tort-law duty on gun \nmanufacturers because \u201cthe gun industry is already \nunder heavy regulation and a carefully calibrated \nstatutory scheme at the federal and state levels,\u201d \nshowing that legislatures have \u201calready made [their] \ndetermination of which firearms transactions\u201d are \n\u201csocially useful.\u201d  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta \nU.S.A., Corp., 126 F. Supp. 2d 882, 899, 902 (E.D. Pa. \n2000), aff\u2019d, 277 F.3d 415 (3d Cir. 2002) (Greenberg, \nJ., joined by Alito and Ambro, JJ.). \nAt bottom, the PLCAA comes with a promise:  \nThose who faithfully comply with the Nation\u2019s expan-\nsive regulatory regime need not fear private civil lia-\nbility.  As Congress explained: \n\n20 \nBusinesses in the United States that are en-\ngaged in interstate and foreign commerce \nthrough the lawful design, manufacture, \nmarketing, distribution, importation, or sale \nto the public of firearms or ammunition \nproducts that have been shipped or trans-\nported in interstate or foreign commerce are \nnot, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlaw-\nfully misuse firearm products or ammuni-\ntion products that function as designed and \nintended. \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  In other words, Congress and \nthe States may regulate; private litigants may not.  \nThe First Circuit\u2019s rejection of this compromise will \ngenerate the very legal uncertainty the PLCAA was \ndesigned to quash.  If allowed to stand, lawful conduct \nmay now be subject to the review of innovative plain-\ntiffs\u2019 attorneys, ultimately resulting in, as the PLCAA \nwarns, \u201cthe disassembly and destabilization of other \nindustries and economic sectors lawfully competing in \nthe free enterprise system of the United States.\u201d  15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6).   \nTake, for example, the common practice of market-\ning products as \u201cmilitary grade.\u201d  Ford Motor Com-\npany has used precisely this term in advertisements \nfor its pickup trucks.  See Addison White, Is Ford\u2019s \nAluminum Really \u2018Military Grade\u2019?, MotorBiscuit \n(Dec. \n22, \n2019), \navailable \nat \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/4k9c9jmz.  The obvious intent of such a \nclaim is to suggest that an item is of a higher quality \nor exceptionally durable.  Firearms manufacturers, \nlike Amici Curiae, sometimes make similar claims \n\n21 \nregarding their products.  None of the countless fed-\neral and state regulations governing the firearms in-\ndustry prohibit them from doing so.  Yet, according to \nthe First Circuit, suggesting that a firearm is of \u201cmil-\nitary-grade\u201d may now result in crushing civil liability.  \nSee Pet. App. 273a.  For some Amici Curiae, such legal \nuncertainty is truly an existential threat\u2014precisely \nwhat PLCAA sought to avoid. \nAs the PLCAA makes explicit, the expansive stat-\nutory regime enacted by Congress and the States has \nleft no room for \u201cexpansion of the common law.\u201d  15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7).  The First Circuit erred when it \nallowed Mexico to regulate via an innovative theory of \ntort law. \nB. The United States Constitution Precludes \nMexico\u2019s Attempt To Regulate The Ameri-\ncan Firearms Industry. \nWhat makes Mexico\u2019s suit uniquely egregious is \nthat it not only upends an expansive and comprehen-\nsive statutory scheme enacted by Congress and the \nStates, it also undermines the United States Consti-\ntution itself\u2014the Nation\u2019s highest law\u2014which pro-\ntects the right of Americans to manufacture, sell, and \npossess firearms.  \nAs this Court has held, \u201cthe Second and Four-\nteenth Amendments protect an individual right to \nkeep and bear arms for self-defense.\u201d  N.Y. State Rifle \n& Pistol Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 17 (2022) (cit-\ning Heller, 554 U.S. 570, and McDonald v. City of Chi-\ncago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010)).  That right inherently ex-\ntends to \u201cprotect[] ancillary rights necessary to the re-\nalization of the core right to possess a firearm,\u201d such \n\n22 \nas the right to \u201cobtain the bullets necessary to use \nthem,\u201d the right to \u201cmaintain proficiency in firearms \nuse,\u201d and, of course, the right to \u201cacquire arms\u201d in the \nfirst place.  Teixeira v. Cnty. of Alameda, 873 F.3d \n670, 677 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 \nF.3d 684, 704 (7th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe right to possess \nfirearms for protection implies a corresponding right \nto acquire and maintain proficiency in their use; the \ncore right wouldn\u2019t mean much without the training \nand practice that make it effective.\u201d). \nBecause this lawsuit targets the entire firearms \nindustry in the United States\u2014indeed, that was Mex-\nico\u2019s very purpose in suing\u2014see Pet. Br. 5\u201311\u2014it \nthreatens the Second and Fourteenth Amendment \nrights of Americans.  The PLCAA was enacted to pre-\nvent suits brought by governmental entities to \u201cex-\npand civil liability\u201d in novel ways and thereby \u201cregu-\nlate interstate and foreign commerce\u201d in circumven-\ntion of the legislatures and in derogation of \u201cbasic con-\nstitutional right[s] and civil libert[ies].\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6)\u2013(8).  In fact, Congress cited its desire to \nprotect the Second Amendment specifically as its pri-\nmary justification for enacting the law.  See id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(1)\u2013(2).  It is hard to imagine a case more em-\nblematic of what the PLCAA was adopted to bar than \nthis suit, where Mexico seeks to stifle conduct pro-\ntected by both statute and the Constitution.   \nFurther, while \u201cthe central component,\u201d Heller, \n554 U.S. at 599, of the Second Amendment right was \n\u201cindividual self-defense,\u201d McDonald, 561 U.S. at 767, \nthe Framers saw fit to enumerate it in the Constitu-\ntion for an additional reason:  As the Second Amend-\nment itself declares, \u201c[a] well regulated Militia\u201d is \n\n23 \n\u201cnecessary to the security of a free State.\u201d  U.S. \nConst., amend. II.  The \u201cMilitia\u201d consists of ordinary \ncitizens who are \u201cphysically capable of acting in con-\ncert for the common defense.\u201d  Heller, 554 U.S. at 595 \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 246 (prescribing the composition of the militia).  It \nremains an important component of the Nation\u2019s de-\nfense, available for the President to activate in times \nof emergency.  See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (\u201cWhenever \nthere is an insurrection in any State against its gov-\nernment . . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 252 (\u201cWhenever . . . unlawful ob-\nstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion \nagainst the authority of the United States, make it \nimpracticable to enforce the laws of the United States \nin any State by the ordinary course of judicial pro-\nceedings . . . .\u201d); id. \u00a7 253 (certain other instances of \n\u201cinsurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combina-\ntion, or conspiracy\u201d). \nTo ensure the militia is ready to serve, the Consti-\ntution empowers Congress to \u201cprovide for organizing, \narming, and disciplining, the Militia,\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nI, \u00a7 8, cl. 16, as well as to \u201cprovide for calling forth the \nMilitia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress In-\nsurrections and repel Invasions,\u201d id. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 15.  \nTo that end, Congress has created an extensive policy \nframework at the federal level that encourages Amer-\nicans to exercise their individual Right to Keep and \nBear Arms.  See supra.  Indeed, Congress has gone so \nfar as to arm private citizens directly.  The Corpora-\ntion for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms \nSafety, 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 40701(a), operates the Civilian \nMarksmanship Program, id. \u00a7\u00a7 40721\u201333, that, \namong other things, distributes military-surplus fire-\narms to American citizens in order to \u201cinstruct\u201d them \nin marksmanship and to \u201cpromote practice\u201d in \n\n24 \nfirearms use, id. \u00a7 40722(1)\u2013(2); see also Civilian \nMarksmanship \nProgram, \nAbout \nthe \nCMP, \nhttps://thecmp.org/about/ (\u201cThe Civilian Marksman-\nship Program (CMP) is a national organization dedi-\ncated to training and educating U. S. citizens in re-\nsponsible uses of firearms and airguns through gun \nsafety training, marksmanship training and competi-\ntions.\u201d).   \nThus, the Right to Keep and Bear Arms is not only \na matter of \u201cpersonal liberty,\u201d McDonald, 561 U.S. at \n774 (internal quotation marks omitted)\u2014though it \ncertainly is that\u2014but also a safeguard of the \u201cnatural \ndefence of a free country\u201d that ensures militia readi-\nness for national self-defense in addition to the mili-\ntary readiness of the organized armed forces.  Heller, \n554 U.S. at 595\u201397, 599 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  In other words, the Second and Fourteenth \nAmendments do double duty, vindicating individual \nliberty and \u201cpreserv[ing] the national security.\u201d  \nNordyke v. King, 319 F.3d 1185, 1196 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(Gould, J., concurring).  \nThe present suit threatens to weaken the Nation\u2019s \n\u201cnatural defence\u201d by disarming the American people.  \nBy harming the ability of Amici Curiae to manufac-\nture and sell firearms, the First Circuit\u2019s decision, if \nallowed to stand, would impede the ability of law-\nabiding citizens to participate effectively as members \nof the militia\u2014something the PLCAA was designed to \nprotect.     \nWhat is perhaps most astounding is that the entity \nattempting to pierce the heart of a core constitutional \nright is a foreign sovereign.  It is axiomatic that \u201c[t]he \nauthority of a nation within its own territory is abso-\nlute and exclusive.\u201d  Church v. Hubbart, 6 U.S. (2 \n\n25 \nCranch) 187, 234 (1804) (Marshall, C.J.), abrogated \non other grounds by Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  And, con-\nversely, \u201c[t]he laws of no nation can justly extend be-\nyond its own territories, except so far as regards its \nown citizens.\u201d  The Apollon, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 362, \n370 (1824) (Story, J.).  That is, the United States has \nexclusive authority regarding firearms policy in the \nUnited States; Mexico has none.  Yet the First Circuit \nwould allow a foreign sovereign to use a tort action to \nplow through an extensive statutory regime and the \nU.S. Constitution itself\u2014enacted, in pertinent part, \nto prevent foreign states from encroaching on na-\ntional sovereignty\u2014to disarm American citizens.  \nThis Court has gone to exceptional lengths to cabin \nthe reach of tort law when its application among do-\nmestic actors encroaches on constitutional rights.  \nSee, e.g., McKee v. Cosby, 139 S. Ct. 675 (2019) \n(Thomas, J., concurring in the denial of certiorari) \n(discussing N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 \n(1964)).  The Right to Keep and Bear Arms \u201cis not a \nsecond-class right\u201d and thus, all things being equal, \nwould demand at least as much in this case, where a \nforeign government seeks to wield tort law to en-\ncroach on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.  See \nBruen, 597 U.S. at 70 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). \nBut the Court need not go nearly as far.  Instead, \nunlike the First Circuit, it simply should recognize \nthat Congress did not build into a statute meant to \nbar lawsuits of this kind an exception that empowered \ncourts to bless such lawsuits via breathtakingly ex-\npansive applications of common-law doctrines.  The \npredicate exception\u2019s \u201cproximate cause\u201d requirement \ndoes not let Mexico hold companies, like Amici \n\n26 \nCuriae, liable in tort for its own cartels\u2019 criminal mis-\nuse of firearms illegally smuggled to them by third \nparties.  Congress has spoken.  The Constitution has \nspoken.  The First Circuit must yield. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the decision below.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 3, 2024 \nSTEPHEN J.

They and their members are concerned with \nattempts to subject industries that manufacture law-\nful products to unprincipled liability for costs of soci-\netal problems regardless of whether any of their con-\nduct proximately caused those alleged harms. \nThe NAM is the largest manufacturing associa-\ntion in the United States, representing small and \nlarge manufacturers in all 50 states and every indus-\ntrial sector. Manufacturing employs nearly 13 mil-\nlion men and women, contributes $2.89 trillion to the \nUnited States economy annually, has the largest \neconomic impact of any major sector, and accounts \nfor over half of all private-sector research and devel-\nopment in the nation. The NAM is the voice of the \nmanufacturing community and leading advocate for \na policy agenda and liability laws that help manufac-\nturers compete in the global economy and create jobs \nacross the United States. \nATRA is a broad-based coalition of businesses, \ncorporations, municipalities, associations, and pro-\nfessional firms that have pooled their resources to \npromote reform of the civil justice system with the \ngoal of ensuring fairness, balance, and predictability \nin civil litigation. For more than three decades,  \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for amici affirm this brief was \nnot authored in whole or in part by counsel for any party and \nthat no person or entity, other than amici curiae, their mem-\nbers, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to the \npreparation or submission of the brief. Counsel of record for all \nparties received timely notice of the intention to file this brief.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \nATRA has filed amicus briefs in cases involving im-\nportant liability issues.  \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct (PLCAA), Congress requires a showing that a \nfirearms manufacturer is the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of \nharm for which a plaintiff seeks relief in order for the \nplaintiff to proceed on the claim. This requirement \nincorporates from tort law traditional notions of \nproximate cause that have served to protect manu-\nfacturers engaged in lawful commerce from unprin-\ncipled liability over their products. Thus, although \nthis case arises in the context of firearms, the First \nCircuit\u2019s erroneous holding on proximate causation \nhas implications for the manufacture and sale of \nmany lawful products that have inherent risks relat-\ned to their use and misuse. Indeed, comparable law-\nsuits that have sought to force manufacturers and \nsellers of lawful products\u2014such as lead paint, pre-\nscription medicines, and beverages in plastic bot-\ntles\u2014to pay for state and local government efforts to \ndeal with risks consumers created with the lawfully \nsold products (lead poisoning, drug abuse and litter).  \nFor at least three reasons, the Court should grant \nthe petition to correct the First Circuit\u2019s decision. \nFirst, the court found that foreseeability alone could \nsatisfy proximate cause, creating a circuit split. See \nEstados Unidos Mexicanos v. Smith & Wesson \nBrands, Inc., 91 F.4th 511, 534 (1st Cir. 2024). In \n2002, an American government brought similar alle-\ngations as those here, and the Third Circuit dis-\nmissed the case. It held that proximate causation re-\nquires \u201ca direct relation between the injury asserted \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \nand the injurious conduct alleged,\u201d and the govern-\nment did not establish proximate cause between sell-\ning a lawful product and the public safety concerns \nover how some consumers used the product. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n423 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Holmes v. Securities In-\nvestor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268-69 (1992)).  \nSecond, the court did not require Respondent to \nidentify any specific sales of the Petitioners\u2019 products \nthat foreseeably caused the alleged harms. See Esta-\ndos Unidos Mexicanos, 91 F.4th at 532 (\u201cOf course, \nthe complaint does not allege defendants\u2019 awareness \nof any particular unlawful sale.\u201d). Rather, Respond-\nent pleaded foreseeability in aggregated generalities, \narguing that engaging in commerce of a product that \ncauses known harms satisfies proximate cause when \nthese harms occur\u2014regardless of how attenuated \nfrom the manufacturers and sellers. And third, the \ncomplaint seeks to impose joint and several liability \non an industry for a broad range of expenses rather \nthat than establish that a manufacturer\u2019s conduct \ncaused any of the specific harms alleged. \nAmerican liability law, when grounded in proxi-\nmate causation, does not impose blame or obligations \nfor product-based societal harms on industries that \nput those lawful products into the stream of com-\nmerce. It may be foreseeable, for example, that un-\nderage individuals will purchase alcoholic beverages, \ncausing harm to themselves, their parents, or others, \nbut manufacturers and sellers of wine, beer and \nspirts are not liable for these harms. See, e.g., Alston \nv. Advanced Brands & Importing Co., 494 F.3d 562, \n565 (6th Cir. 2007). Similarly, it is foreseeable that \nsome people will become obese or develop diabetes \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \nfrom certain foods, but companies that sell those \nfoods are not liable for these conditions. Pelman v. \nMcDonald's Corp., 237 F. Supp.2d 512, 538 (S.D.N.Y. \n2003). Otherwise, there would be no just stopping \npoint. Many social issues related to products may be \nforeseeable in a general, aggregated sense. But, \nthere are no specific incidents of harm that are prox-\nimately caused by the manufacturers or sellers of \nthose products. In fact, these harms are often caused \nby acts\u2014including unlawful acts\u2014of third parties. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s formulation of proximate cau-\nsation cannot stand; it violates the basic tenets of the \nAmerican civil justice system. Rather than subject \ndefendants to liability for harm they actually caused, \nwhich is the essence of American tort law, these law-\nsuits will be used to generate revenue for local and \nstate governments, regardless of fault, and overtake \nfederal or state regulatory regimes that take consid-\nerable care to manage public risks associated with \nlawful economic activity. Here, a foreign country is \nusing this litigation to do both. Denying this petition, \ntherefore, could invite foreign governments to sue \nAmerican companies for a wide-variety of social con-\nditions. Such lawsuits could destabilize the American \neconomy and generate lawfare designed to hinder the \ncompetitiveness of American manufacturers. This \ncase could also inspire new speculative domestic law-\nsuits against manufacturers of lawful products. \nFor these reasons, as discussed in detail below, \namici urge the Court to grant the Petition and hold \nthat proximate cause cannot be satisfied here by the \nacts of manufacturing, selling, and marketing lawful \nproducts, including products with known, foreseeable \nrisks. There is no doubt that gun violence, just like \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \nlead poisoning, litter, and drunk driving, are critical \npublic health and safety matters. But, these facts \nalone should not give rise to deep pocket jurispru-\ndence against market participants that did not prox-\nimately cause the harms alleged. \nARGUMENT \nI. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT THE PETI-\nTION TO REAFFIRM THAT FORESEEABIL-\nITY IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROXI-\nMATE CAUSATION \nProximate causation is \u201cfundamental\u201d to Ameri-\ncan tort law and \u201cappl[ies] in any kind of case,\u201d Dan \nB. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 180, at 443 n.2 (2001), \nincluding this one where liability centers on whether \na legal violation is the \u201cproximate cause of the harm \nfor which relief is sought,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThe purpose of requiring a showing of proximate \ncause is to \u201climit liability even where the fact of cau-\nsation is clearly established,\u201d including where manu-\nfacturers put products into the stream of commerce \nthat can cause harm, but the harms are not proxi-\nmately caused by the manufacturers. Prosser & \nKeeton on Torts 273 (5th ed. 1984). There must be a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268-\n69. The specific injury the plaintiff sustained must \nbe the type of injury that a reasonable person would \nsee as a likely result of specific acts of misconduct. \nAs this Court has held, \u201cforeseeability alone does \nnot ensure the close connection that proximate cause \nrequires.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, Fla., \n581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017). Foreseeability is a neces-\nsary, but not sufficient element of proximate cause. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nConduct \u201ccannot meaningfully be viewed as \u2018wrong\u2019 if \nthe actor could not possibly have contemplated that \nthe action might produce the harm.\u201d David G. Owen, \nFiguring Foreseeability, 44 Wake Forest L. Rev. \n1277, 1277-78 (2009). There are some harms that \nmay flow downstream from a defendant\u2019s acts, but \nare too remote from these acts to satisfy proximate \ncausation. See Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Wel-\nfare Fund v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 921 \n(3d Cir. 1999) (recognizing \u201can injury that is too re-\nmote from its causal agent fails to satisfy tort law\u2019s \nproximate cause requirement\u201d); see also Holmes, 503 \nU.S. at 268-69 (discussing the remoteness doctrine). \nConsider what is probably the most famous tort \ncase, Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R., in which Judge \nCardozo found that a railroad was not liable for an \ninjury that occurred as a result of a sequence of \nevents that began with a railroad employee pushing \na passenger carrying a small package into a depart-\ning train., 162 N.E. 99, 99 (N.Y. 1928). It may have \nbeen foreseeable that the employee\u2019s action could re-\nsult in the pushed passenger falling and experienc-\ning an injury or the package dropping, resulting in \nproperty \ndamage. \nBut \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \ninjury\u2014\ntriggered by a fireworks explosion from the dropped \npackage that ended in a weighing scale tipping over \nand hitting a passenger far down the platform\u2014was \nsimply too many steps removed from the employee\u2019s \nconduct for the railroad to be legally responsible for \nthat person\u2019s harm. Whether viewed as a decision \nrooted in duty or proximate causation, foreseeability \nthat some harm will be caused is not sufficient to es-\ntablish proximate cause for all downstream injuries. \nThe direct relationship between the alleged miscon-\nduct and specific harms asserted was missing. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \nIndeed, the California Supreme Court has recog-\nnized the legal predicament of over-relying on fore-\nseeability to justify liability, albeit under the element \nof duty. See Dillon v. Legg, 441 P.2d 912 (Cal. 1968) \n(allowing liability for reasonably foreseeable emo-\ntional harm). After foreseeability ceased to provide \nany meaningful bounds to liability, the court re-\nstrained its expansive doctrine, famously observing \nthat \u201cthere are clear judicial days on which a court \ncan foresee forever and thus determine liability but \nnone on which that foresight alone provides a social-\nly and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of dam-\nages for that injury.\u201d Thing v. La Chusa, 771 P.2d \n814, 830 (Cal. 1989). Applying a \u201cpure foreseeability\u201d \ntest in such cases, the court continued, had failed to \nappreciate \u201cthe importance of avoiding the limitless \nexposure to liability.\u201d Id. at 821. In such instances, \n\u201cforeseeability\u201d was \u201cnot a realistic indicator of po-\ntential liability\u201d and did \u201cnot afford a rational limita-\ntion on recovery.\u201d Id. at 826. \nIn cases such as the one here, proximate cause \nprovides this \u201cnecessary limitation on liability.\u201d Exx-\non Co. v. SOFEC, Inc., 517 U.S. 830, 838 (1996). \nWithout the constraint of proximate cause, tort law \nwould \u201cproduce extreme results,\u201d because \u201c[i]n a \nphilosophical sense, the consequences of an act go \nforward to eternity, and the causes of an event go \nback to the dawn of human events, and beyond.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts, su-\npra, at 264). \u201cSomewhere a point will be reached \nwhen courts will agree that the link has become too \ntenuous.\u201d Id. (quoting Petition of Kinsman Transit \nCo., 338 F.2d 708, 725 (2d Cir. 1964)); accord \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J. concurring) (\u201cLife \nis too short to pursue every human act to its most \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \nremote consequences; \u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d). \nHere, Congress sought to ensure that such tenu-\nous liability could not be used in this context, ex-\npressly stating that liability in cases such as this one \nrequires the defendants to violate the law and this \nviolation to be the \u201cproximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThe legislative intent could not be clearer. Congress \nenacted the PLCAA to stop a rash of cases similar to \nthe one here. State and local governments in the \nUnited States sought to subject this industry to the \nsame types of damages. Most of these cases failed, \nincluding on proximate causation grounds. See, e.g., \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1114-16 (Ill. 2004) (\u201c[W]e do not intend to min-\nimize the very real problem of violent crime and the \ndifficult tasks facing law enforcement and other pub-\nlic officials,\u201d but liability law does not allow a cause \nof action \u201cso broad and undefined that the presence \nof any potentially dangerous instrumentality in the \ncommunity could be deemed to\u201d invoke it.). But, \nsome succeeded. See City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1141 (Ohio 2002). \nCongress stated in the PLCAA that it enacted the \nlaw to ensure these companies would not be held lia-\nble for \u201charm caused by those who criminally or un-\nlawfully misuse\u201d their products. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). \nThis context makes this case an important one for \nthe Court to hear. In the two decades since City of \nChicago and City of Cincinnati were heard, many \nother industries have been sued to pay costs associ-\nated with unlawful uses of lawful products. The \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \nCourt should grant the petition to ensure that prox-\nimate causation continues to distinguish between (a) \ntortious acts that directly cause harm, from (b) man-\nufacturing, selling and promoting lawful products. \nTortious acts are often considered intervening causes \nthat \u201coccur after the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d and cut-off \nproximate causation. John L. Diamond, Cases and \nMaterials on Torts 256 (2001). Case law recognizes \nthat a party \u201cmay reasonably proceed upon the as-\nsumption that others will obey the criminal law,\u201d \nKeeton, supra, at 305, even though \u201cthere are bad \npeople in society who do bad things.\u201d Stahlecker v. \nFord Motor Co., 667 N.W.2d 244, 251 (Neb. 2003).  \nIn individual cases, where plaintiffs seek to sub-\nject manufacturers to liability for criminal acts of \nothers, the lack of proximate causation has been de-\nterminative in dismissing claims. In Stahlecker, a \nperson alleged that the manufacturer of her vehicle \nand tire could be subject to liability after a defective \ntire stranded her at night in a remote location, ex-\nposing her to risk of harm. See id. But, these compa-\nnies are not the proximate cause of injuries caused \nby criminals who harm stranded drivers merely be-\ncause the companies sold car parts that failed. See \nid. at 259 (finding criminal acts of third parties were \nan \u201cintervening cause which necessarily defeats \nproof of the essential element of proximate cause\u201d).  \nIndeed, in many of the industry-wide cases where \nlocal and state governments have sued manufactur-\ners and sellers of products over downstream risks of \nproducts, individuals first attempted to bring per-\nsonal injury claims against these companies. Those \ncases were not successful because the individuals in \nthe cases could not establish that the companies \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \nproximately caused them harm based on a tortfea-\nsor\u2019s independent actions. See Santiago v. Sherwin \nWilliams Co., 3 F.3d 546, 550 (1st Cir. 1993) (recog-\nnizing that proximate cause subjects defendants to \nliability \u201conly for the harm they have caused\u201d and \nseparates \u201ctortfeasors from innocent actors.\u201d). Prox-\nimate cause requires much greater specificity.  \nCases such as the one at bar attempt to overcome \nthis void and individual burdens of proof by substi-\ntuting governments as plaintiffs and seeking deriva-\ntive costs. They suggest it is foreseeable that selling \ncertain products and engaging in certain lawful \nsales, when aggregated, will lead to criminal activity \nand cause governments to spend resources dealing \nwith that criminal activity. Proximate causation does \nnot become clearer, though, by pulling back the cau-\nsation lens to the level of blurred generalities.  \nThe Court should grant the petition to clarify that \nforeseeability of general conditions associated with \nsales of certain products does not establish proxi-\nmate causation for those conditions or monies spent \nby governments to address the criminal misconduct \nof its citizens. The importance of reinforcing these \nlegal principles for this and other such cases cannot \nbe overstated. \nII. THIS PETITION IS EMBLEMATIC OF NU-\nMEROUS LAWSUITS SEEKING TO IMPOSE \nINDUSTRY-WIDE LIABILITY FOR COSTS \nASSOCIATED \nWITH \nMANUFACTURING \nAND SELLING LAWFUL PRODUCTS \nOver the past few decades, numerous lawsuits \nhave been filed that attempt to subject entire indus-\ntries, as well as individual companies, to liability for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \nsocietal harms associated with lawful products. \nMany of these lawsuits, as with the case at bar, have \nsought to require large businesses, rather than indi-\nvidual wrongdoers or taxpayers, to remediate envi-\nronmental damage or pay costs of social harms asso-\nciated with categories of products, regardless of \nwrongful conduct or proximate causation. They typi-\ncally assert that a non-defective product had nega-\ntive societal impacts, notwithstanding its benefits, \nand that manufacturers should pay \u201ctheir fair share\u201d \nof the attendant costs. See generally Victor E. \nSchwartz et al., Can Governments Impose a New Tort \nDuty to Prevent External Risks? The \u201cNo Fault\u201d The-\nories Behind Today\u2019s High-Stakes Government Re-\ncoupment Suits, 44 Wake Forest L. Rev. 923 (2009).  \nAround the same time that state and local gov-\nernments filed suit against firearm manufacturers, \nseveral governments sought to impose costs related \nto lead poisoning and lead paint remediation on \ncompanies that had lawfully manufactured paint and \npigment decades before, rather than on the landlords \nwho owned and were responsible for maintaining \nproperties with lead paint. See, e.g., Rhode Island v. \nLead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc., 951 A.2d 428 (R.I. 2008); In \nre Lead Paint Litig., 924 A.2d 484, 505 (N.J. 2007). \nMost courts rejected these lawsuits, including on \nproximate causation grounds. The Rhode Island Su-\npreme Court, which was the first state high court to \nrule in this litigation, affirmed that proximate causa-\ntion is \u201ca basic requirement\u201d and that governments \ncannot take causation shortcuts unavailable to indi-\nvidual plaintiffs. Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, 951 A.2d at 450. \n\u201cIn addition to proving that defendant is the cause-\nin-fact of an injury, a plaintiff must demonstrate \nproximate cause.\u201d Id. Echoed the New Jersey Supreme \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \nCourt: \u201cbasic fairness dictates that a defendant must \nhave caused the [harm] to be held liable\u201d for it. In re \nLead Paint Litig., 924 A.2d at 451. \nAnother series of claims has involved govern-\nments suing pharmaceutical manufacturers, distrib-\nutors, and pharmacies over costs associated with \nprescription opioid abuse. See, e.g. Rachel Graf, Ky. \nAG Hires Motley Rice, Others in Opioid Fight, \nLaw360, Sept. 22, 2017.2 Several years ago, individ-\nuals brought personal injury claims against opioid \nmanufacturers, but courts concluded that prescrip-\ntion drug abuse was largely caused by physicians \nwho overprescribed the painkillers and individuals \nwho took the drugs illegally. See Max Mitchell, Can \nOpiate Litigation Ever Be the New Mass Tort?, Legal \nIntelligencer, Mar. 31, 2017.3 In reframing the litiga-\ntion, government plaintiffs blamed manufacturers, \ndistributors, and pharmacies for generating a mar-\nketplace in which opioid addiction could arise. See id. \nThe lawsuits sought money for fighting opioid addic-\ntion and, in some cases, heroin addiction as well. See, \ne.g., West Virginia v. McKesson Corp., No. 16-cv-\n01772, 2016 WL 843443 (S.D. W. Va. Feb. 23, 2016). \nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court, which is the only \nstate high court to rule on this litigation, dismissed \nthe claims, in part on causation grounds. See State ex \nrel. Hunter v. Johnson & Johnson, 499 P.3d 719 \n(Okla. 2021). The court observed that this lawsuit \n\u201cchallenges us to rethink traditional notions of liabil-\n                                                 \n2 https://www.law360.com/articles/966930/ky-ag-hires-motley-\nrice-others-in-opioid-fight. \n3 http://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/almID/ \n1202782732124. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \nity and causation\u201d because manufacturers do not \ncontrol how wholesalers distributed their products, \nhow others dispersed their products, or how individ-\nuals used their products. See id. at 728-29.  \nThe burgeoning litigation over climate change has \nfollowed this same playbook. See, e.g., City & County \nof Honolulu v. Sunoco LP, 537 P.3d 1173, 1184 (Haw. \n2023), petition for cert. pending (Nos. 23-947, 23-\n952). More than thirty state and local governments \nhave sued energy producers for costs related to cli-\nmate change, including paying for seawalls and other \ninfrastructure projects allegedly needed to abate the \nimpacts of the changing climate. See Manufacturers\u2019 \nAccountability Project, Manufacturers\u2019 Center for \nLegal Action (providing detailed background on this \nlitigation).4 The Second Circuit, which is the only \ncourt to reach the merits of the cases, underscored \nthe litigation\u2019s causation problems. See City of New \nYork v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir. 2021). \nIt noted the City\u2019s \u201cambitious\u201d goal was \u201cto effective-\nly impose strict liability for the damages caused by \nfossil fuel emissions no matter where in the world \nthose emissions were released (or who released \nthem).\u201d Id. at 93. Yet, some state courts, as indicated \nby the petition pending in the Court, have looked \npast these fundamental causation issues.  \nIn all of these cases, government plaintiffs are ef-\nfectively asking courts to lower causation standards \nfor them. They are attempting to avoid traditional \nnotions of proximate causation by creating a Cui-\nsinart of industry-wide liability, where all manufac-\nturers are blended together so they do not have to \n                                                 \n4 http://mfgaccountabilityproject.org/. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \nshow that any specific defendant proximately caused \nany specific harm. They generally seek to replace \nproximate causation with risk contribution theories, \nsuggesting the chain of commerce is a viable substi-\ntute for the chain of causation, or imposing market \nshare or other types of enterprise liability. As the \nMissouri Supreme Court stated in rejecting such a \nproposition: \u201cTo the extent the city\u2019s argument is \nthat the Restatement requires something less than \nproof of actual causation or should replace actual \ncausation in a [government] case, it is incorrect.\u201d City \nof St. Louis v. Benjamin Moore & Co., 226 S.W.3d \n110, 114 (Mo. 2007). Otherwise, as other courts have \nnoted, people would frame a case as a government \naction \u201crather than a product liability suit\u201d in order \nto lower causation standards. See City of Chicago v. \nAm. Cyanamid Co., No. 02 CH 16212, 2003 WL \n23315567, at *4 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Oct. 7, 2003).  \nIn particular, imposing joint and several liability \nagainst entire industries or basing liability on mar-\nket-share or risk contribution is not a substitute for \nproximate causation. In product liability litigation \nbrought by private plaintiffs, courts have widely re-\njected theories of collective liability when plaintiffs \ncannot establish that a particular product caused \ntheir injuries. These rulings have occurred in the \ncontext of litigation over asbestos,5 silicone breast \n                                                 \n5 See, e.g., Case v. Fibreboard Corp., 743 P.2d 1062, 1067 (Okla. \n1987) (\u201c[P]ublic policy favoring recovery on the part of an inno-\ncent plaintiff does not justify the abrogation of the rights of a \npotential defendant to have a causative link proven . . . where \nthere is a significant probability that those acts were related to \nthe injury.\u201d); Bostic v. Georgia Pac. Corp., 439 S.W.3d 332, 340 \n(Tex. 2014) (reaffirming Texas\u2019s rejection of \u201ctheories of collec-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \nimplants,6 high-fructose corn syrup,7 among other \nproducts.8 Courts have rejected attempts to impose \nliability on manufacturers of brand-name medicines \nwhen a plaintiff used a generic drug made by anoth-\ner company.9 And, a court has determined that \nquick-serve restaurants do not proximately cause \nobesity and other health problems. Pelman, 237 F. \nSupp.2d at 538 (\u201cNo reasonable person could find \nprobable cause based on the facts in the Complaint \nwithout resorting to wild speculation.\u201d) (cleaned up).  \nThe California courts have provided a cautionary \ntale in its lead paint litigation, where a Court of Ap-\npeal allowed local governments to circumvent proxi-\nmate causation. See People v. ConAgra Grocery \nProds. Co., 17 Cal.App.5th 51 (2017), cert. denied, \n138 S. Ct. 377 (2018). The court eliminated the bed-\nrock principle that a person can be liable only for \n                                                                                                    \ntive liability\u2014alternative liability, concert of action, enterprise \nliability, and market share liability\u201d). \n6 See Matter of New York State Silicone Breast Implant Litig., \n166 Misc.2d 85, 89-90 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995). \n7 See S.F. v Archer Daniels Midland Co., 594 Fed. Appx. 11, 13 \n(2d Cir. 2014) (rejecting market share liability against five \nmanufacturers of high-fructose corn syrup, which plaintiffs al-\nleged was a toxic substance that caused diabetes). \n8 See City of St. Louis, 226 S.W.3d at 116 (\u201c[E]ven if it could \nprove that because of that defendant\u2019s market share there was \na statistical probability that its paint was in a certain percent-\nage of the properties at issue \u2014 that would not establish that \nthe particular defendant actually caused the problem\u201d). \n9 See, e.g., In re Darvocet, Darvon, & Propoxyphene Prods. Liab. \nLitig., 756 F.3d 917, 938-39, 941-54 (6th Cir. 2014) (applying \nlaws of 22 states); McNair v. Johnson & Johnson, 818 S.E.2d \n852, 859-67 (W. Va. 2018); Huck v.

Atlantic Richfield Co., No. \n100CV788657, 2014 WL 1385823, at *44 (Cal. Super. \nCt. Mar. 26, 2014). Rather, three manufacturers \nwere jointly and severally liable for remediating all \nlead paint regardless of who sold which lead paint, \nwhen, or where. It was of no consequence that the \noverwhelming majority of the lead paint to be abated \nwas sold by competitors, often after a defendant \nstopped selling lead paint. \nMost courts, though, have properly recognized \nthat removing wrongful causation from tort law \nwould create litigation chaos, \u201cgiv[ing] rise to a cause \nof action . . . regardless of the defendant\u2019s degree of \nculpability.\u201d Tioga Pub. Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Gypsum \nCo., 984 F.2d 915, 921 (8th Cir. 1993). \u201cAll a creative \nmind would need to do is construct a scenario de-\nscribing a known or perceived harm of a sort that can \nsomehow be said to relate back to the way a company \nor an industry makes, markets, and/or sells its non-\ndefective, lawful product or service, and a [case] \nwould be conceived and a lawsuit born.\u201d Spitzer v. \nSturm, Ruger & Co., 309 A.D.2d 91, 96 (N.Y. App. \nDiv. 2003). The list of targets for such litigation \nwould be endless. Terrorists may use electrical com-\nponents or watches as components in missiles or \nbombs.10 Artificial intelligence products have un-\n                                                 \n10 See, e.g., David Brunnstrom, Debris from North Korean Mis-\nsile in Ukraine Could Expose Procurement Networks, Reuters, \nFeb. 24, 2024 (reporting a North Korean missile fired by Russia \nin Ukraine contained a large number of components linked to \nU.S.-based companies); Denise Winterman, Casio F-91W: The \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \nleashed opportunities for fraud.11 Ski masks are used \nto conceal the faces of those who commit crime.12 \nKnives are commonly used in robberies and homi-\ncides.13 The list goes on and on. \nIn each of these situations, manufacturers are \nmaking and selling lawful products. They, like oth-\ners, may be aware that some of their products will be \ndiverted, used or misused, sometimes criminally, in \nways that cause harm. The Court should grant the \npetition to reaffirm traditional notions of proximate \ncausation.  \nIII. MANAGING PUBLIC RISKS ASSOCIATED \nWITH INHERENTLY HARMFUL PROD-\nUCTS SHOULD REMAIN A REGULATORY, \nNOT LITIGATION MATTER \nFinally, the Court should grant the petition to en-\nsure that no government\u2014foreign or domestic\u2014can \n                                                                                                    \nStrangely Ubiquitous Watch, BBC News, Apr. 26, 2011 (report-\ning that a $12 digital watch was used in terrorist bombs). \n11 See, e.g., Heather Chen & Kathleen Magramo, Finance Work-\ner Pays Out $25 Million After Video Call with Deepfake \u2018Chief \nFinancial Officer\u2019, CNN, Feb. 4, 2024; Emily Flitter & Stacy \nCowley, Voice Deepfakes Are Coming for Your Bank Balance, \nN.Y.

Some Cities Say Yes, Stateline, Jan. 10, \n2024. \n13 See Statista, Number of Murder Victims in the United States \nin 2022, by Weapon Used, https://www.statista.com/statistics/\n195325/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-weapon-used/ (last visited \nMay 22, 2024); Statista, Number of Robberies in the United \nStates in 2022, by Weapon Used, https:/ /www.statista.com/sta-\ntistics/251914/number-of-robberies-in-the-us-by-weapon/ \n(last \nvisited May 22, 2024). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \nuse the civil justice system to regulate lawful prod-\nucts by imposing untenable liability costs on their \ncontinued production and sale. These government \nplaintiffs often appreciate that the effect of \u201cholding \nproducers liable for all the harm their products prox-\nimately cause\u201d\u2014not that they proximately cause\u2014is \neffectively prohibiting \u201caltogether the continued \ncommercial distribution of such products.\u201d See James \nA. Henderson, Jr. & Aaron D. Twerski, Closing the \nAmerican Products Liability Frontier: The Rejection \nof Liability Without Defect, 66 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1266, \n1329 (1991) (emphasis added); see also City of New \nYork, 993 F.3d at 93 (\u201cIf the Producers want to avoid \nall liability, then their only solution would be to \ncease global production altogether.\u201d).   \nOften, regulation through litigation, in addition to \nseeking financial relief, is a goal of these actions. See, \ne.g., Establishing Accountability for Climate Damag-\nes: Lessons from Tobacco Control, Summary of the \nWorkshop on Climate Accountability, Public Opinion, \nand Legal Strategies, Union of Concerned Scientists \n& Climate Accountability Inst. (Oct. 2012) (\u201cEven if \nyour ultimate goal might be to shut down a company, \nyou still might be wise to start out by asking for \ncompensation for injured parties.\u201d).14 Here, Respond-\nent is seeking an injunction to directly regulate Peti-\ntioners\u2019 business. See Pet. at 12. Some may consider \nRespondents\u2019 proposed reforms sensible, but it is not \nthe role of the courts to impose these changes. \n                                                 \n14 https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/04/ \nestablishing-accountability-climate-change-damages-lessons-\ntobacco-control.pdf. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \nSome scholars have argued that proximate causa-\ntion in cases like this one should be relaxed to pro-\nvide a remedy whenever they perceive that the regu-\nlatory process has failed to address a public welfare \nissue. See, e.g., David A. Dana, Public Nuisance Law \nWhen Politics Fails, 83 Ohio St. L.J. 61 (2022). They \nbelieve courts should be open to regulating through \nlitigation \u201cnotwithstanding the democratic legitima-\ncy and technological competence objections.\u201d Id. at \n66. They also acknowledge that this view casts aside \nnotions of wrongdoing and proximate causation. See \nLeslie Kendrick, The Perils and Promise of Public \nNuisance, 132 Yale L.J. 702, 759 (2023) (acknowledg-\ning this view is a \u201cproblem for those who think tort is \nexclusively the province of wrongful conduct\u201d). They \nbelieve liability against manufacturers and sellers \nallow the impact of a public welfare issue to be \nspread among all users of a product, akin to a tax. Id. \nat 770. The result, though, would be a \u201cRorschach \nblot\u201d for causation, where courts can impose liability \nwithout established principles. Thomas W. Merrill, \nThe New Public Nuisance: Illegitimate and Dysfunc-\ntional, 132 Yale L.J. Forum 985, 988 (2023). \nEnsuring liability law properly aligns with and \ndoes not overtake statutory or regulatory authority is \na significant concern for amici and their members \nbecause manufacturers of all types of products with \ninherent risks\u2014from prescription medicines to \nhousehold chemicals to energy products to alcoholic \nbeverages\u2014must be able to rely on government regu-\nlations seeking to balance consumer and public risks. \nWeighing costs, benefits and social value of produc-\ning and using these products and factoring in any \nadverse effects is part of the delicate balancing for \nwhich only legislatures, and administrative agencies \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \npursuant to legislative authority, are suited. If a \ncompany violates any such regulation, there are en-\nforcement remedies tailored to that violation.  \nHere, the Court should grant the petition, prevent \nthe circumvention of the PLCAA, and reinforce the \ntraditional notions of proximate causation in cases \nsuch as this one. Addressing societal costs associated \nwith product use or misuse does not justify altering \nlongstanding liability law. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, amici curiae respectfully re-\nquest that this Court grant the Petition. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPhilip S.

The current observation, an internal strategic assessment, does not introduce new external facts but refines my predictive model by identifying the next critical variable. My cumulative beliefs are now structured around both the completed legal arguments and the key institutional factors that will likely influence the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n1.  **Completed Cert-Stage Legal Arguments (Beliefs Stable & Consolidated):** My analysis of the Petition, Brief in Opposition, and Reply Brief is now complete. The petitioners have mounted a formidable case for certiorari, effectively countering Mexico's arguments.\n    *   **Procedural Posture:** The petitioners have successfully transformed the case's interlocutory nature from a potential weakness into a central argument *for* review. Their core contention is that PLCAA's purpose as a statutory immunity is nullified if cases are not dismissed at the pleading stage, making immediate review necessary. This argument is bolstered by precedent (*RJR Nabisco*) and strategic concessions (on personal jurisdiction) that ensure the PLCAA question is a live controversy.\n    *   **Proximate Causation & Circuit Split:** The petitioners have sharpened their claim of a circuit split. They argue the First Circuit's decision on proximate cause, while nominally interpreting state law, is in direct conflict with how other federal and state courts have interpreted the \"traditional common-law rule\" of proximate cause in nearly identical factual scenarios involving gun manufacturers. They contend this creates a de facto split on a fundamental principle embedded within PLCAA's predicate exception.\n    *   **Aiding-and-Abetting & *Taamneh* Precedent:** The petitioners have forcefully argued that the First Circuit's aiding-and-abetting analysis is irreconcilable with the Supreme Court's recent decision in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*. They characterize Mexico's claims not as allegations of \"affirmative conduct\" but as a \"passive failure\" to control the downstream actions of independent, licensed third parties\u2014precisely the theory of liability that *Taamneh* rejected.\n\n2.  **Identification of Key Institutional Signal (New Belief/Refined Predictive Model):** The latest observation confirms that the analysis of the parties' briefing is concluded. The most significant remaining uncertainty for predicting the outcome of the certiorari petition is no longer found in the parties' filings, but in the potential involvement of the U.S. Solicitor General.\n    *   **High Likelihood of a CVSG:** The case presents a confluence of factors that typically trigger a \"Call for the Views of the Solicitor General\" (CVSG) from the Court. These include the interpretation of a major federal statute (PLCAA), significant foreign policy implications (a lawsuit brought by the government of Mexico), and a major impact on a domestic industry.\n    *   **Predictive Weight of the Solicitor General:** The Solicitor General's recommendation is a highly influential signal for the Court. A recommendation to grant certiorari would substantially increase the probability of review, while a recommendation to deny would significantly decrease it. The SG's brief would provide the Court with the Executive Branch's perspective on the statute's meaning, the foreign relations consequences of the lawsuit, and the overall importance of the legal questions presented.\n    *   **Shift in Focus:** My predictive focus now shifts from analyzing the parties' arguments to monitoring the Court's docket for a CVSG. The presence or absence of a CVSG, and the subsequent recommendation from the Solicitor General, is now the most informative piece of evidence to acquire for predicting the Court's next action.",

This has created a clear asymmetry in my information landscape. The most salient uncertainty for the immediate task of predicting certiorari is now the strength and nature of the opposition. This action directly targets that uncertainty.\n\nTask EIG (0.85): The outcome of this search will cause a significant belief update. 1) Finding strong, influential amicus support for Mexico would counterbalance the petitioner-side signal, indicating the issue is hotly contested and complex, which could either increase or decrease the perceived need for review, thus refining my prediction model. 2) Finding weak or no support would strongly reinforce the narrative that the First Circuit's decision is an outlier, dramatically increasing my confidence in a cert grant. Either outcome provides critical information for predicting the cert grant.\n\nDesign EIG (0.70): This action is crucial for refining a general model of amicus influence. My current model has incorporated the signal from petitioner-side amici. This action allows me to test the importance of the *balance* or *asymmetry* of amicus support. A generalizable strategy must account for the full landscape, not just one side. Observing the outcome will help calibrate the weight given to a lopsided amicus field versus a balanced one in predicting cert grants, a core component of any SCOTUS prediction model.\n\nJoint EIG (1.55): The action is a highly logical and efficient next step. It addresses the most immediate and significant gap in my understanding of the case's cert-worthiness, while also providing a valuable opportunity to refine a fundamental principle of SCOTUS prediction strategy.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case continues to evolve with the introduction of new signals from external actors. While my previous analysis of the parties' legal arguments and the potential role of the Solicitor General remains intact, the latest observation\u2014the filing of several influential amicus briefs\u2014provides a new, concrete signal that significantly strengthens the case for certiorari.\n\n1.  **Completed Cert-Stage Legal Arguments (Beliefs Stable & Reinforced):** My analysis of the core legal arguments from the cert-stage briefing is stable. The new observation, however, reveals that these arguments are now being amplified and broadened by influential amici curiae, increasing their resonance and perceived importance.\n    *   **Procedural Posture, Proximate Causation, and *Taamneh* Precedent:** These core arguments by the petitioners remain the central legal pillars for granting review. My belief that these arguments are compelling is unchanged.\n    *   **Reinforcement by Amici (New Belief):** The filing of amicus briefs by major business and legal organizations substantially reinforces the petitioners' claims. These briefs signal to the Court that the case's implications extend far beyond the firearms industry.\n        *   The **National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)** and **American Tort Reform Association (ATRA)** frame the First Circuit's decision as an existential threat to all manufacturers of lawful products, arguing it improperly substitutes \"foreseeability\" for the stricter requirement of \"proximate cause.\" They explicitly connect this case to a broader trend of \"lawfare\" against industries for the societal costs of product misuse (e.g., lead paint, opioids).\n        *   The **American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce**, represented by former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, introduces a constitutional dimension, arguing that such an unbounded theory of liability raises significant Due Process concerns regarding fair notice for businesses.\n        *   The **Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition (FRAC)** frames the issue as one of separation of powers, contending that the First Circuit's ruling allows the judiciary to usurp the comprehensive regulatory role that federal and state legislatures have already assumed in the area of firearms policy.\n\n2.  **Key Institutional Signals (Beliefs Refined & Updated):** My predictive model previously identified the Solicitor General's potential involvement as the next key variable. The new observation refines this by adding a new, realized signal while confirming the status of the anticipated one.\n    *   **Solicitor General Involvement (Belief Stable but Unchanged):** The search of the docket confirms that the Court has not yet issued a \"Call for the Views of the Solicitor General\" (CVSG). My belief that a CVSG is likely and that the SG's recommendation will be highly predictive remains stable. The observation simply confirms that this event has not yet occurred.\n    *   **Signal of Strong Amicus Support (New Belief):** The observation has provided a new and powerful signal: the petitioners have garnered significant support from a diverse and influential set of amici. The presence of briefs from the nation's largest manufacturing association (NAM), a prominent tort reform group (ATRA), and a legal center led by a former Attorney General is a strong indicator of the case's national importance. This level of organized support significantly increases the probability that the Court will grant certiorari, as it demonstrates that the legal issues raised are not isolated but are perceived as a threat to broad sectors of the U.S. economy and established legal principles. My predictive focus now incorporates this realized signal, which weighs heavily in favor of a grant, while still monitoring for the potential CVSG as the next major inflection point.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's trajectory toward a potential Supreme Court grant is becoming more nuanced. The previous observation established a strong, one-sided signal of amicus support for the petitioners. This new observation confirms and expands that support while also introducing the first significant countervailing signal: amicus support for the respondent, Mexico. This transforms my view of the cert-stage landscape from a one-sided push to a contested field of influential actors.\n\n1.  **Completed Cert-Stage Legal Arguments (Beliefs Stable & Expanded):** My core analysis of the petitioners' legal arguments remains stable. The arguments centered on the First Circuit's expansive interpretation of proximate causation, its alleged conflict with the *Taamneh* precedent, and the proper scope of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). The new observation reinforces the breadth of support for these arguments.\n    *   **Core Petitioner Arguments (Stable):** The central legal questions regarding proximate cause, aiding-and-abetting liability for manufacturers, and the interpretation of PLCAA's \"predicate exception\" remain the primary drivers for a potential grant of certiorari.\n    *   **Reinforcement by a Broadening Amicus Coalition (Belief Expanded):** My prior belief in strong amicus support for the petitioners is now significantly expanded. In addition to the previously identified business and legal reform groups (NAM, ATRA, American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce), this observation confirms support from:\n        *   **Second Amendment Groups:** The Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) has filed a brief, adding a constitutional rights dimension to the petitioners' case.\n        *   **Firearms Industry Groups:** The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has also filed, reinforcing the industry-specific concerns and likely arguing from a position of deep familiarity with the federal regulatory scheme that the petitioners claim is being usurped.\n        *   **Legal Foundations:** The Atlantic Legal Foundation adds another voice from the conservative/libertarian legal community, likely focusing on principles of limited tort liability and judicial restraint.\n        This diverse coalition (business, tort reform, constitutional, industry) sends a powerful, multi-faceted signal to the Court that the First Circuit's decision is viewed as a threat across a wide spectrum of legal and economic interests.\n\n2.  **Key Institutional Signals (Beliefs Refined & Transformed):** My model for predicting a grant of certiorari is significantly updated by this observation. The landscape is no longer one-sided.\n    *   **Solicitor General Involvement (Belief Stable but Unchanged):** The docket search did not indicate a Call for the Views of the Solicitor General (CVSG). My belief remains that a CVSG is a likely future event and that the SG's recommendation will be a highly predictive signal. This belief is stable and awaits new evidence.\n    *   **Amicus Support Landscape (Belief Transformed from One-Sided to Contested):** This is the most significant update. My previous belief was that amicus support was a strong, unidirectional signal favoring the petitioners. That is no longer the case.\n        *   **Petitioner Support:** As noted above, this is even stronger and broader than previously understood.\n        *   **Respondent Support (New, Countervailing Belief):** The observation reveals the first major amicus filing in support of the respondent, Mexico. The source is highly significant: a group of 43 current and former Members of Congress, including Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representatives Madeleine Dean and Jamie Raskin. This is a crucial development because it injects a strong political and legislative counter-narrative. These amici will likely argue that the First Circuit's interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception is consistent with congressional intent and necessary to provide a remedy for harms caused by illegal gun trafficking. Their presence signals to the Court that this is not a settled issue of statutory interpretation and that a significant contingent of the legislative branch supports holding manufacturers accountable under these circumstances.\n\nIn sum, the case for certiorari appears stronger, but for a more complex reason. It is no longer just about a broad coalition asking the Court to correct a lower court's error; it is now a clear conflict between influential groups on a matter of national importance. The clash between a powerful business/industry/legal coalition and a vocal contingent of federal legislators elevates the case's profile, making it more likely that the Court will feel compelled to step in and resolve the fundamental questions about the scope of PLCAA and the limits of proximate causation.",

Congress has been wrestling with \nthat complicated issue for nearly a century, weighing \ncompeting interests as it makes legislative decisions.  \nHow, exactly, to balance those interests is a policy \nquestion that the Constitution assigns to Congress, \nsubject to the constraints of the Second Amendment. \nIf Respondent (the plaintiff below) had its way, \nhowever, such policy decisions would be thrown to the \ncourts.  Indeed, the Mexican government\u2019s suit here \nurges the lower court to impose all sorts of far-reaching \nregulations on the firearms industry, restrictions that \nCongress itself has considered and declined to adopt.  \nThis suit thus attempts to use the Judicial Branch to \nseize legislative power.  As Congress explained nearly \ntwenty years ago, such a maneuver \u201cthreaten[s] the \n \n1 Consistent with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the House states \nthat no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part \nand that no person or entity other than the House or its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief.   \n2 The House\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) has \nauthorized the filing of this amicus brief.  BLAG comprises the \nHonorable Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House, the Honorable \nSteve Scalise, Majority Leader, the Honorable Tom Emmer, \nMajority Whip, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, Minority Leader, \nand the Honorable Katherine Clark, Minority Whip, and it \n\u201cspeaks for, and articulates the institutional position of, the \nHouse in all litigation matters.\u201d  Rule II.8(b), Rules of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, 118th Cong. (2023), https://perma.cc/ \nDK3P-55K6.  The Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader, and \nthe Majority Whip voted to support the filing of this brief; the \nMinority Leader and Minority Whip did not. \n\n2 \nSeparation of Powers.\u201d  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8).  \nThat is why Congress passed the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act (Protection Act), which bars \nsuits\u2014like this one\u2014that try to hold firearms \nmanufacturers liable for harms caused by third-party \ncriminals and seek injunctive relief that would impose \nnew regulations on the firearms industry. \nThe House files this brief to explain how the decision \nbelow, if affirmed, would allow the Judicial Branch to \nusurp Congressional authority and to do so through a \nsuit that Congress intended to bar.   \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nAfter careful study, Congress decided that firearms \nmanufacturers ordinarily should not be liable for \nharms that third-party criminals cause when they use \nfirearms illegally.  It thus enacted the Protection Act, \nwhich generally bars suits that aim to hold firearms \nmanufacturers liable for such harms.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 \n7902(a), 7903(5)(A).  Congress did not enact this law in \na vacuum.  Rather, it was reacting to a flurry of \nlawsuits attempting to hold the firearms industry \nliable for criminals misusing their products.  These \nsuits sought both huge damage awards and injunctive \nrelief that would have imposed new regulations on the \nfirearms industry.  However, Congress saw this legal \ngambit for what it was: an effort to use the judiciary to \naccomplish policy goals that advocates could not \nachieve through the legislative process.   \nThe Mexican government is now trying to peddle the \nsame scheme.  It aims to hold American firearms \ncompanies (Petitioners) liable for harms that criminal \ndrug cartels have caused in Mexico.  And it is asking a \nfederal court to impose regulations\u2014like a requirement \nfor firearms to include certain features that would \n\n3 \nprevent unauthorized users from firing them\u2014that \nCongress has declined to adopt.  This is the posterchild \nfor what the Protection Act was meant to prevent.  But \nthe court below concluded that the Protection Act does \nnot apply to the Mexican government\u2019s complaint.  In \nits view, this suit falls within a narrow statutory \nexception, one that permits suits against companies \nthat knowingly violate a firearms law if\u2014and only if\u2014\nthat violation is the proximate cause of the relevant \nharm.  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThat exception does not apply here.  Petitioners \nthemselves have violated no law.  They sell lawful \nproducts to firearms wholesalers or retail dealers that \nhave the federal government\u2019s stamp of approval (through \ngovernment-issued licenses).  Yet this may amount to \naiding and abetting, according to the court below, \nbecause Petitioners allegedly know that some of their \nfirearms will end up in cartel hands yet fail to take \naction to prevent that.  This limitless theory would \nessentially criminalize the sale of any product that has \na history of third-party misuse, and it lacks support in \nthis Court\u2019s precedent.  Nor is any purported legal \nviolation by firearms companies the proximate cause \nof the damage that the cartels caused.  Cartels are, \nafter all, criminal enterprises.  And Petitioners\u2019 (lawful) \nconduct in the United States is far removed from \nharms inflicted by the cartels in Mexico.  Their firearms \npass through other hands and even cross the U.S. \nborder before finding their way into criminal enter-\nprises, which independently choose to use them in a \nmanner that inflicts harm.  These are textbook inter-\nvening causes.  And Petitioners have no special \nrelationship with the cartels that might justify departing \nfrom the standard rule, which does not hold parties \nliable for harms that flow from intervening causes. \n\n4 \nThe Mexican government, at bottom, is trying to \ndragoon the judiciary into exercising legislative power.  \nIt is asking the lower court to impose regulations that \nCongress has consistently refrained from enacting.  \nSuch an outcome would run afoul of the separation of \npowers and is exactly what Congress sought to prevent \nwhen it passed the Protection Act.  Affirming the \njudgment below would therefore gut the Protection Act \nand threaten our constitutional order.  The Court \nshould reverse the First Circuit\u2019s decision. \nARGUMENT \nI. The authority to regulate the firearms \nindustry rests with Congress, not the courts, \nand Congress has decided that firearms \nmanufacturers generally should not be held \nliable for third parties\u2019 criminal actions \nThe Constitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative \n[p]owers herein granted shall be vested in \u2026 Congress.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1.  Congress has used these powers, \nsuch as regulating interstate and foreign commerce, \nfor nearly a century to regulate the firearms industry.  \nAfter the \u201cbloody \u2018Tommy gun\u2019 era\u201d3 of the 1920s, \nCongress passed the National Firearms Act of 1934, \nwhich imposed taxation and registration requirements \non those firearms most associated with gangland \nviolence.  See Pub. L. No. 73-474, 48 Stat. 1236 (1934).  \nJust four years later, Congress passed the Federal \nFirearms Act, which created a licensing requirement \n \n3 History of gun-control legislation, Wash. Post (Dec. 22, 2012, \n9:17 PM), https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/history-of-\ngun-control-legislation/2012/12/22/80c8d624-4ad3-11e2-9a42-d1 \nce6d0ed278_story.html.  \n\n5 \nfor firearms manufacturers and dealers.  Pub. L. No. \n75-785, 52 Stat. 1250 (1938). \nThe Federal Firearms Act was then superseded by \nthe Gun Control Act of 1968.  Pub. L. No. 90-618, 82 \nStat. 1213 (1968).  The Gun Control Act, among other \nthings, expanded the Federal Firearms Act\u2019s licensing \nscheme and prevented certain persons (such as felons) \nfrom possessing firearms.  Id. \u00a7 102, 82 Stat. at 1220, \n1221-23.  At the same time, it created a process that \nprohibited individuals could follow to restore their \nright to possess firearms.  Id., 82 Stat. at 1224.  In 1986, \nCongress passed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act, \nwhich made it unlawful \u201cto transfer or possess\u201d \nmachineguns manufactured on or after the date of \nenactment.  Pub. L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986).  \nIt also shrunk the category of felons who may not \npossess firearms.  Id. \u00a7 101, 100 Stat. at 449-50.  In  \nthe Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act of 1993, \nCongress required federal licensees to perform back-\nground checks before selling firearms to the public.  \nPub. L. No. 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536 (1993).  Then,  \nas part of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, Congress generally made it \nunlawful (1) \u201cto manufacture, transfer, or possess\u201d \nsemiautomatic weapons and (2) \u201cto transfer or possess\u201d \nlarge capacity magazines.  See Pub. L. 103-322, \u00a7\u00a7 \n110102(a), 110103(a), 110105(2), 108 Stat. 1796, 1996-\n97, 1998-99, 2000 (1994).  However, Congress did not \nrenew those two provisions after they lapsed in 2004. \nAs history shows, Congress has regularly used its \npowers to legislate on matters concerning the firearms \nindustry.  While its legislative decisions inevitably have \nnot satisfied everyone, they are ultimately Congress\u2019s \ndecisions to make, subject to Second Amendment con-\nstraints.  And when litigants have attempted to sidestep \n\n6 \nthe legislative process by using the courts to impose \nmore onerous firearms regulations than they could \nobtain through the legislative process, Congress has \nresponded to preserve its own constitutional authority. \nA. Litigants attempt to use the courts to \nregulate the firearms industry \nBeginning in the late 1990s, various public entities \nand other plaintiffs began suing members of the \nfirearms industry.  They raised \u201cnovel claims that \ninvite[d] courts to dramatically break from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose firearm manufactur-\ners to unprecedented and unlimited liability exposure.\u201d  \nSee H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 11 (2005).  These claims, \nbased on attenuated theories of causation or expansive \ninterpretations of strict liability, sought to hold \nfirearms manufacturers responsible for harms caused \nby third parties, usually those far down the chain of \ncustody, who used firearms illegally.  See, e.g., id. at 6.   \nThese suits constituted attempts to use the courts to \naccomplish what these plaintiffs could not achieve \nthrough the legislative process: the imposition of broad \nnew regulations on the firearms industry.  See id. at 20 \n(\u201cPublic entities are seeking to achieve through the \ncourts what they have been unwilling or unable to \nobtain legislatively, namely limits on the numbers, \nlocations, and types of firearms sold, and a shift in the \nresponsibility for violence response costs to the private \nsector.\u201d); see also id. at 19 (noting that these suits \nincluded \u201cboth extraordinary compensatory and punitive \ndamage requests and requests for injunctive relief in \nan attempt to impose broad new regulations on the \ndesign, manufacture, and interstate distribution of \nfirearms, outside of the appropriate legislative context\u201d); \nGanim v.

For example, a city mayor, \nafter announcing that his city had sued firearms \nmanufacturers, explained that he was \u201ccreating law \nwith litigation\u201d because contrary views had prevailed \nin the legislature that \u201ckept [his preferred] laws from \nbeing passed.\u201d  See Fred Musante, After Tobacco,  \nHandgun Lawsuits, N.Y. Times (Jan. 31, 1999), https:// \nwww.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/nyregion/after-tobacco-\nhandgun-lawsuits.html.  And the cases themselves \nshow that the goal was to make new law.   \nOne suit, for example, seemingly invited the court to \nrestrict the number of firearms that manufacturers \ncould sell.  Compare First Amended Complaint \u00b6 70, \nCity of Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., No. A9902369, \n2002 WL 34429690 (Ohio Com. Pl. 2002) (\u201cFor many \nyears, defendants knew or should have known that \nthey were producing and selling substantially more \nfirearms than could be justified by the legitimate gun \nmarket, and that a substantial portion of their guns \nwould end up in the hands of criminals \u2026.\u201d); with id. \n\u00b6 2(A) (prayer for relief) (requesting injunctive relief \nthat would require the manufacturers \u201cto create and \nimplement standards regarding their own distribution \nof handguns \u2026 in an effort to eliminate or \nsubstantially reduce the secondary handgun market\u201d).   \nThe plaintiff in that case also wanted the court to \nrequire firearms manufacturers to regulate their third-\nparty dealers, even though those dealers were already \nregulated and licensed by federal and state govern-\n\n8 \nments.  Compare id. \u00b6\u00b6 74 (alleging the manufacturers \n\u201cmake no meaningful efforts to supervise, regulate or \nimpose standards on the distribution practices of \neither the distributors or the dealers who channel \ntheir handguns to the public\u201d), 75 (\u201cDefendant manu-\nfacturers fail to supervise, regulate or set standards \nfor dealers\u2019 conduct, but instead rely upon the mere \nfact that dealers are licensed by the federal and state \ngovernments.\u201d); with id. \u00b6 2(A) (prayer for relief) \n(requesting injunctive relief that would require the \nmanufacturers \u201cto create and implement standards \nregarding \u2026 the conduct of the dealers to whom the \ndistributors supply handguns in an effort to eliminate \nor substantially reduce the secondary handgun market\u201d). \nAnother suit asked the court to \u201cuse its injunctive \npowers to mandate the redesign of firearms.\u201d  Penelas \nv. Arms Tech., Inc., 778 So. 2d 1042, 1045 (Fla. Dist. Ct. \nApp. 2001) (footnote omitted).  That redesign would \nhave supposedly (1) \u201cprevent[ed] the weapons from \nbeing used by unauthorized persons,\u201d (2) \u201calert[ed] \nusers that a round is in the weapon\u2019s chamber,\u201d and  \n(3) \u201cprevent[ed] the weapon from being fired when the \nammunition magazine is removed.\u201d  Id. at n.5. \nThe court in one of the two cases discussed above \nrecognized that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crequest that the trial \ncourt use its injunctive powers to mandate the \nredesign of firearms \u2026 [wa]s an attempt to regulate \nfirearms and ammunition through the medium of the \njudiciary.\u201d  Id. at 1045 (\u201cThe power to legislate belongs \nnot to the judicial branch of government, but to the \nlegislative branch.\u201d).  But the other suit was ultimately \nallowed to proceed.  See Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1150 (Ohio 2002) (reversing \ndismissal).  Similar suits spread to many jurisdictions.  \nSee H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 11 (collecting cases).   \n\n9 \nAs the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House \nof Representatives (Judiciary Committee) explained, \nthis wave of litigation \u201cero[ded] \u2026 the separation of \npowers\u201d because regulating the firearms industry \u201cis a \njob for voters and legislatures, not lawyers.\u201d  Id. at 20; \nsee also id. (\u201cJust as large damage awards have a \nregulatory effect, requests for injunctive relief tend to \nforce the judiciary to intrude into the decision-making \nprocess properly within the sphere of another branch \nof government.\u201d); Koohi v. United States, 976 F.2d \n1328, 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (\u201c[T]he framing of injunctive \nrelief may require the courts to engage in the type of \noperational decision-making beyond their competence \nand constitutionally committed to other branches \u2026.\u201d). \nCongress was also concerned about what product \nwould be the next target for these efforts to regulate \nby judicial fiat.  See H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 23 (\u201cOnce \nit is established, in the context of firearms, that \nproduct manufacturers are responsible for \u2018socializing\u2019 \nthe cost of criminal product misuse, then it may be \nhard to avoid the slippery slope that leads to making \nautomobile dealers liable for drunk drivers, knife \nmanufacturers liable for knife wounds, or food \nmanufacturers liable for the harm caused by the fat \ncontent of snacks.\u201d).  As a result of all these concerns, \nCongress was spurred to act. \nB. Congress responds by passing the Protection \nAct to, among other things, preserve its \nlegislative \nauthority \nto \nmake \npolicy \ndecisions regarding firearms regulation \nTo \u201cprotect the separation of powers and uphold \ndemocratic procedures,\u201d id. at 5, Congress, in 2005, \npassed with bipartisan support the Protection Act, \nwhich was signed into law by President George W. \nBush.  The Protection Act made clear that firearms \n\n10 \ncompanies should generally not be \u201cliable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  The Protection \nAct was meant to address the above-mentioned lawsuits, \nsince those \u201cattempt[s] to use the judicial branch to \ncircumvent the Legislative branch of government to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce through \njudgments and judicial decrees [threatened] the \nSeparation of Powers.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). \nThe Protection Act generally prevents a plaintiff \nfrom suing a firearms manufacturer for injuries \n\u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of \na firearm because the firearms company is not a \nproximate cause of those injuries.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 7902(a), \n7903(5)(A).  In particular, \u201cthe absence of a special \nrelationship between criminal third parties and \nmanufacturers means that negligence claims should \nbe dismissed.\u201d  H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 8.  After all, \n\u201cmanufacturers have no duty to control the conduct \nof third parties.\u201d  Id.  As the Judiciary Committee \nnoted at the time, \u201c[h]andgun manufacturers histori-\ncally have been found, and generally continue to be \nfound, to have no duty to third-party victims of firearm \nmisuse, such as criminal or accidental misuse.\u201d  Id. \n(footnote omitted). \nCongress did not, however, give firearms manufac-\nturers a blank check to violate the law.  Rather, the \nProtection Act contains several exceptions.  The one \nrelied upon by the court below allows suits against \nmanufacturers or sellers when they \u201cknowingly\u201d \nviolate a state or federal firearms law related to the \nsale or marketing of firearms, and that violation \n\u201cwas a proximate cause of the harm for which relief \nis sought.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  A recent suit \nagainst a firearms seller, Walmart, shows how this \n\n11 \nnarrow exception works in practice.  There, a Walmart \nemployee who was suffering from a mental health \ncrisis bought a shotgun directly from the Walmart \nwhere he worked, even though his cowor\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress has been wrestling with \nthat complicated issue for nearly a century, weighing \ncompeting interests as it makes legislative decisions.  \nHow, exactly, to balance those interests is a policy \nquestion that the Constitution assigns to Congress, \nsubject to the constraints of the Second Amendment. \nIf Respondent (the plaintiff below) had its way, \nhowever, such policy decisions would be thrown to the \ncourts.  Indeed, the Mexican government\u2019s suit here \nurges the lower court to impose all sorts of far-reaching \nregulations on the firearms industry, restrictions that \nCongress itself has considered and declined to adopt.  \nThis suit thus attempts to use the Judicial Branch to \nseize legislative power.  As Congress explained nearly \ntwenty years ago, such a maneuver \u201cthreaten[s] the \n \n1 Consistent with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the House states \nthat no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part \nand that no person or entity other than the House or its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief.   \n2 The House\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) has \nauthorized the filing of this amicus brief.  BLAG comprises the \nHonorable Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House, the Honorable \nSteve Scalise, Majority Leader, the Honorable Tom Emmer, \nMajority Whip, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, Minority Leader, \nand the Honorable Katherine Clark, Minority Whip, and it \n\u201cspeaks for, and articulates the institutional position of, the \nHouse in all litigation matters.\u201d  Rule II.8(b), Rules of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, 118th Cong. (2023), https://perma.cc/ \nDK3P-55K6.  The Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader, and \nthe Majority Whip voted to support the filing of this brief; the \nMinority Leader and Minority Whip did not. \n\n2 \nSeparation of Powers.\u201d  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8).  \nThat is why Congress passed the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act (Protection Act), which bars \nsuits\u2014like this one\u2014that try to hold firearms \nmanufacturers liable for harms caused by third-party \ncriminals and seek injunctive relief that would impose \nnew regulations on the firearms industry. \nThe House files this brief to explain how the decision \nbelow, if affirmed, would allow the Judicial Branch to \nusurp Congressional authority and to do so through a \nsuit that Congress intended to bar.   \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nAfter careful study, Congress decided that firearms \nmanufacturers ordinarily should not be liable for \nharms that third-party criminals cause when they use \nfirearms illegally.  It thus enacted the Protection Act, \nwhich generally bars suits that aim to hold firearms \nmanufacturers liable for such harms.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 \n7902(a), 7903(5)(A).  Congress did not enact this law in \na vacuum.  Rather, it was reacting to a flurry of \nlawsuits attempting to hold the firearms industry \nliable for criminals misusing their products.  These \nsuits sought both huge damage awards and injunctive \nrelief that would have imposed new regulations on the \nfirearms industry.  However, Congress saw this legal \ngambit for what it was: an effort to use the judiciary to \naccomplish policy goals that advocates could not \nachieve through the legislative process.   \nThe Mexican government is now trying to peddle the \nsame scheme.  It aims to hold American firearms \ncompanies (Petitioners) liable for harms that criminal \ndrug cartels have caused in Mexico.  And it is asking a \nfederal court to impose regulations\u2014like a requirement \nfor firearms to include certain features that would \n\n3 \nprevent unauthorized users from firing them\u2014that \nCongress has declined to adopt.  This is the posterchild \nfor what the Protection Act was meant to prevent.  But \nthe court below concluded that the Protection Act does \nnot apply to the Mexican government\u2019s complaint.  In \nits view, this suit falls within a narrow statutory \nexception, one that permits suits against companies \nthat knowingly violate a firearms law if\u2014and only if\u2014\nthat violation is the proximate cause of the relevant \nharm.  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nThat exception does not apply here.  Petitioners \nthemselves have violated no law.  They sell lawful \nproducts to firearms wholesalers or retail dealers that \nhave the federal government\u2019s stamp of approval (through \ngovernment-issued licenses).  Yet this may amount to \naiding and abetting, according to the court below, \nbecause Petitioners allegedly know that some of their \nfirearms will end up in cartel hands yet fail to take \naction to prevent that.  This limitless theory would \nessentially criminalize the sale of any product that has \na history of third-party misuse, and it lacks support in \nthis Court\u2019s precedent.  Nor is any purported legal \nviolation by firearms companies the proximate cause \nof the damage that the cartels caused.  Cartels are, \nafter all, criminal enterprises.  And Petitioners\u2019 (lawful) \nconduct in the United States is far removed from \nharms inflicted by the cartels in Mexico.  Their firearms \npass through other hands and even cross the U.S. \nborder before finding their way into criminal enter-\nprises, which independently choose to use them in a \nmanner that inflicts harm.  These are textbook inter-\nvening causes.  And Petitioners have no special \nrelationship with the cartels that might justify departing \nfrom the standard rule, which does not hold parties \nliable for harms that flow from intervening causes. \n\n4 \nThe Mexican government, at bottom, is trying to \ndragoon the judiciary into exercising legislative power.  \nIt is asking the lower court to impose regulations that \nCongress has consistently refrained from enacting.  \nSuch an outcome would run afoul of the separation of \npowers and is exactly what Congress sought to prevent \nwhen it passed the Protection Act.  Affirming the \njudgment below would therefore gut the Protection Act \nand threaten our constitutional order.  The Court \nshould reverse the First Circuit\u2019s decision. \nARGUMENT \nI. The authority to regulate the firearms \nindustry rests with Congress, not the courts, \nand Congress has decided that firearms \nmanufacturers generally should not be held \nliable for third parties\u2019 criminal actions \nThe Constitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative \n[p]owers herein granted shall be vested in \u2026 Congress.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1.  Congress has used these powers, \nsuch as regulating interstate and foreign commerce, \nfor nearly a century to regulate the firearms industry.  \nAfter the \u201cbloody \u2018Tommy gun\u2019 era\u201d3 of the 1920s, \nCongress passed the National Firearms Act of 1934, \nwhich imposed taxation and registration requirements \non those firearms most associated with gangland \nviolence.  See Pub. L. No. 73-474, 48 Stat. 1236 (1934).  \nJust four years later, Congress passed the Federal \nFirearms Act, which created a licensing requirement \n \n3 History of gun-control legislation, Wash. Post (Dec. 22, 2012, \n9:17 PM), https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/history-of-\ngun-control-legislation/2012/12/22/80c8d624-4ad3-11e2-9a42-d1 \nce6d0ed278_story.html.  \n\n5 \nfor firearms manufacturers and dealers.  Pub. L. No. \n75-785, 52 Stat. 1250 (1938). \nThe Federal Firearms Act was then superseded by \nthe Gun Control Act of 1968.  Pub. L. No. 90-618, 82 \nStat. 1213 (1968).  The Gun Control Act, among other \nthings, expanded the Federal Firearms Act\u2019s licensing \nscheme and prevented certain persons (such as felons) \nfrom possessing firearms.  Id. \u00a7 102, 82 Stat. at 1220, \n1221-23.  At the same time, it created a process that \nprohibited individuals could follow to restore their \nright to possess firearms.  Id., 82 Stat. at 1224.  In 1986, \nCongress passed the Firearm Owners\u2019 Protection Act, \nwhich made it unlawful \u201cto transfer or possess\u201d \nmachineguns manufactured on or after the date of \nenactment.  Pub. L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986).  \nIt also shrunk the category of felons who may not \npossess firearms.  Id. \u00a7 101, 100 Stat. at 449-50.  In  \nthe Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act of 1993, \nCongress required federal licensees to perform back-\nground checks before selling firearms to the public.  \nPub. L. No. 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536 (1993).  Then,  \nas part of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, Congress generally made it \nunlawful (1) \u201cto manufacture, transfer, or possess\u201d \nsemiautomatic weapons and (2) \u201cto transfer or possess\u201d \nlarge capacity magazines.  See Pub. L. 103-322, \u00a7\u00a7 \n110102(a), 110103(a), 110105(2), 108 Stat. 1796, 1996-\n97, 1998-99, 2000 (1994).  However, Congress did not \nrenew those two provisions after they lapsed in 2004. \nAs history shows, Congress has regularly used its \npowers to legislate on matters concerning the firearms \nindustry.  While its legislative decisions inevitably have \nnot satisfied everyone, they are ultimately Congress\u2019s \ndecisions to make, subject to Second Amendment con-\nstraints.  And when litigants have attempted to sidestep \n\n6 \nthe legislative process by using the courts to impose \nmore onerous firearms regulations than they could \nobtain through the legislative process, Congress has \nresponded to preserve its own constitutional authority. \nA. Litigants attempt to use the courts to \nregulate the firearms industry \nBeginning in the late 1990s, various public entities \nand other plaintiffs began suing members of the \nfirearms industry.  They raised \u201cnovel claims that \ninvite[d] courts to dramatically break from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose firearm manufactur-\ners to unprecedented and unlimited liability exposure.\u201d  \nSee H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 11 (2005).  These claims, \nbased on attenuated theories of causation or expansive \ninterpretations of strict liability, sought to hold \nfirearms manufacturers responsible for harms caused \nby third parties, usually those far down the chain of \ncustody, who used firearms illegally.  See, e.g., id. at 6.   \nThese suits constituted attempts to use the courts to \naccomplish what these plaintiffs could not achieve \nthrough the legislative process: the imposition of broad \nnew regulations on the firearms industry.  See id. at 20 \n(\u201cPublic entities are seeking to achieve through the \ncourts what they have been unwilling or unable to \nobtain legislatively, namely limits on the numbers, \nlocations, and types of firearms sold, and a shift in the \nresponsibility for violence response costs to the private \nsector.\u201d); see also id. at 19 (noting that these suits \nincluded \u201cboth extraordinary compensatory and punitive \ndamage requests and requests for injunctive relief in \nan attempt to impose broad new regulations on the \ndesign, manufacture, and interstate distribution of \nfirearms, outside of the appropriate legislative context\u201d); \nGanim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., No. CV 990153198S, \n1999 WL 1241909, at *1 (Conn. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, \n\n7 \n1999) (noting that the complaint sought, \u201c[i]n addition \nto compensatory and punitive damages[,] \u2026 injunctive \nrelief\u201d and explaining that the plaintiffs \u201cseek to \nenjoin the defendants from continuing to produce \nhandguns without safety devices\u201d).   \nIndeed, these plaintiff groups were not particularly \nshy about their motivations.  For example, a city mayor, \nafter announcing that his city had sued firearms \nmanufacturers, explained that he was \u201ccreating law \nwith litigation\u201d because contrary views had prevailed \nin the legislature that \u201ckept [his preferred] laws from \nbeing passed.\u201d  See Fred Musante, After Tobacco,  \nHandgun Lawsuits, N.Y. Times (Jan. 31, 1999), https:// \nwww.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/nyregion/after-tobacco-\nhandgun-lawsuits.html.  And the cases themselves \nshow that the goal was to make new law.   \nOne suit, for example, seemingly invited the court to \nrestrict the number of firearms that manufacturers \ncould sell.  Compare First Amended Complaint \u00b6 70, \nCity of Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., No. A9902369, \n2002 WL 34429690 (Ohio Com. Pl. 2002) (\u201cFor many \nyears, defendants knew or should have known that \nthey were producing and selling substantially more \nfirearms than could be justified by the legitimate gun \nmarket, and that a substantial portion of their guns \nwould end up in the hands of criminals \u2026.\u201d); with id. \n\u00b6 2(A) (prayer for relief) (requesting injunctive relief \nthat would require the manufacturers \u201cto create and \nimplement standards regarding their own distribution \nof handguns \u2026 in an effort to eliminate or \nsubstantially reduce the secondary handgun market\u201d).   \nThe plaintiff in that case also wanted the court to \nrequire firearms manufacturers to regulate their third-\nparty dealers, even though those dealers were already \nregulated and licensed by federal and state govern-\n\n8 \nments.  Compare id. \u00b6\u00b6 74 (alleging the manufacturers \n\u201cmake no meaningful efforts to supervise, regulate or \nimpose standards on the distribution practices of \neither the distributors or the dealers who channel \ntheir handguns to the public\u201d), 75 (\u201cDefendant manu-\nfacturers fail to supervise, regulate or set standards \nfor dealers\u2019 conduct, but instead rely upon the mere \nfact that dealers are licensed by the federal and state \ngovernments.\u201d); with id. \u00b6 2(A) (prayer for relief) \n(requesting injunctive relief that would require the \nmanufacturers \u201cto create and implement standards \nregarding \u2026 the conduct of the dealers to whom the \ndistributors supply handguns in an effort to eliminate \nor substantially reduce the secondary handgun market\u201d). \nAnother suit asked the court to \u201cuse its injunctive \npowers to mandate the redesign of firearms.\u201d  Penelas \nv. Arms Tech., Inc., 778 So. 2d 1042, 1045 (Fla. Dist. Ct. \nApp. 2001) (footnote omitted).  That redesign would \nhave supposedly (1) \u201cprevent[ed] the weapons from \nbeing used by unauthorized persons,\u201d (2) \u201calert[ed] \nusers that a round is in the weapon\u2019s chamber,\u201d and  \n(3) \u201cprevent[ed] the weapon from being fired when the \nammunition magazine is removed.\u201d  Id. at n.5. \nThe court in one of the two cases discussed above \nrecognized that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201crequest that the trial \ncourt use its injunctive powers to mandate the \nredesign of firearms \u2026 [wa]s an attempt to regulate \nfirearms and ammunition through the medium of the \njudiciary.\u201d  Id. at 1045 (\u201cThe power to legislate belongs \nnot to the judicial branch of government, but to the \nlegislative branch.\u201d).  But the other suit was ultimately \nallowed to proceed.  See Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1150 (Ohio 2002) (reversing \ndismissal).  Similar suits spread to many jurisdictions.  \nSee H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 11 (collecting cases).   \n\n9 \nAs the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House \nof Representatives (Judiciary Committee) explained, \nthis wave of litigation \u201cero[ded] \u2026 the separation of \npowers\u201d because regulating the firearms industry \u201cis a \njob for voters and legislatures, not lawyers.\u201d  Id. at 20; \nsee also id. (\u201cJust as large damage awards have a \nregulatory effect, requests for injunctive relief tend to \nforce the judiciary to intrude into the decision-making \nprocess properly within the sphere of another branch \nof government.\u201d); Koohi v. United States, 976 F.2d \n1328, 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (\u201c[T]he framing of injunctive \nrelief may require the courts to engage in the type of \noperational decision-making beyond their competence \nand constitutionally committed to other branches \u2026.\u201d). \nCongress was also concerned about what product \nwould be the next target for these efforts to regulate \nby judicial fiat.  See H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 23 (\u201cOnce \nit is established, in the context of firearms, that \nproduct manufacturers are responsible for \u2018socializing\u2019 \nthe cost of criminal product misuse, then it may be \nhard to avoid the slippery slope that leads to making \nautomobile dealers liable for drunk drivers, knife \nmanufacturers liable for knife wounds, or food \nmanufacturers liable for the harm caused by the fat \ncontent of snacks.\u201d).  As a result of all these concerns, \nCongress was spurred to act. \nB. Congress responds by passing the Protection \nAct to, among other things, preserve its \nlegislative \nauthority \nto \nmake \npolicy \ndecisions regarding firearms regulation \nTo \u201cprotect the separation of powers and uphold \ndemocratic procedures,\u201d id. at 5, Congress, in 2005, \npassed with bipartisan support the Protection Act, \nwhich was signed into law by President George W. \nBush.  The Protection Act made clear that firearms \n\n10 \ncompanies should generally not be \u201cliable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  The Protection \nAct was meant to address the above-mentioned lawsuits, \nsince those \u201cattempt[s] to use the judicial branch to \ncircumvent the Legislative branch of government to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce through \njudgments and judicial decrees [threatened] the \nSeparation of Powers.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). \nThe Protection Act generally prevents a plaintiff \nfrom suing a firearms manufacturer for injuries \n\u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of \na firearm because the firearms company is not a \nproximate cause of those injuries.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 7902(a), \n7903(5)(A).  In particular, \u201cthe absence of a special \nrelationship between criminal third parties and \nmanufacturers means that negligence claims should \nbe dismissed.\u201d  H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 8.  After all, \n\u201cmanufacturers have no duty to control the conduct \nof third parties.\u201d  Id.  As the Judiciary Committee \nnoted at the time, \u201c[h]andgun manufacturers histori-\ncally have been found, and generally continue to be \nfound, to have no duty to third-party victims of firearm \nmisuse, such as criminal or accidental misuse.\u201d  Id. \n(footnote omitted). \nCongress did not, however, give firearms manufac-\nturers a blank check to violate the law.  Rather, the \nProtection Act contains several exceptions.  The one \nrelied upon by the court below allows suits against \nmanufacturers or sellers when they \u201cknowingly\u201d \nviolate a state or federal firearms law related to the \nsale or marketing of firearms, and that violation \n\u201cwas a proximate cause of the harm for which relief \nis sought.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  A recent suit \nagainst a firearms seller, Walmart, shows how this \n\n11 \nnarrow exception works in practice.  There, a Walmart \nemployee who was suffering from a mental health \ncrisis bought a shotgun directly from the Walmart \nwhere he worked, even though his coworkers and \nsupervisor at the store were personally aware of his \nmental disorder.  Brady v. Walmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-\n1412-AAQ, 2022 WL 2987078, at *1-2 (D. Md. July 28, \n2022).  His coworkers and supervisor were also allegedly \naware that he wanted to buy a firearm to harm himself.  \nId. at *1, *16.  The employee ultimately committed suicide \nwith the shotgun he purchased from Walmart.  Id. at \n*2.  The employee\u2019s surviving spouse sued and alleged, \ngiven these particular facts, that Walmart aided and \nabetted the violation of a Maryland law prohibiting \nthe possession of a shotgun by a person who suffers \nfrom a mental disorder.  Id. at *6-*9.  The court \ntherefore determined that the exception applied and \npermitted the suit to proceed.  Id. \nThe decision below, however, is a far cry from the \nWalmart case, which involved a highly unusual fact \npattern, and distorts the exception beyond recognition. \nII. The decision below usurped Congress\u2019s \nlegislative power and, if affirmed, would \nallow a foreign government to use courts to \nimpose firearms regulations that Congress \nhas declined to adopt \nIf this Court affirms the decision below, the \nProtection Act\u2019s narrow exception would swallow the \nrule, and firearms manufacturers would face liability \nthat Congress intended to prevent.  Federal courts, \nin turn, would be asked to second-guess Congress\u2019s \npolicy decisions regarding firearms regulation through \nrequests for injunctive relief.  This result would upset \nthe separation of powers: Congress is charged with \nmaking such policy judgments, not Article III courts. \n\n12 \nA. If affirmed, the decision below would gut \nthe Protection Act \n1.  The Mexican government\u2019s lawsuit seeks to hold \nPetitioners liable for harms that drug cartels inflicted \nwhen they used firearms to commit crimes in Mexico.  \nSee, e.g., Pet. App. 7a (\u00b6 2) (alleging that \u201c[f]or decades \nthe [Mexican] Government and its citizens have been \nvictimized by a deadly flood of military-style and other \nparticularly lethal guns that flows from the U.S. across \nthe border, into criminal hands in Mexico\u201d); id. at 24a \n(\u00b6 52) (alleging that \u201c[t]he cartels that cause such \nbloodshed and terror \u2026 fire [Petitioners\u2019] guns in \nMexico\u201d).  Such an outcome is exactly what Congress \nintended to prevent through the Protection Act. \nThe Protection Act says that suits for harms \n\u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a\u201d \nfirearm \u201cmay not be brought in any Federal or State \ncourt.\u201d  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7902(a), 7903(5)(A).  Congress \nstudied the issue and concluded that businesses that \nlawfully manufacture or distribute firearms \u201care not, \nand should not[] be[,] liable for the harm caused by \nthose who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm \nproducts \u2026 that function as designed and intended.\u201d  \nSee id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  The suit falls squarely within the \nProtection Act\u2019s general bar. \n2.  Petitioners, of course, could be sued consistent \nwith the Protection Act if they \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a \nstate or federal law that relates to selling or marketing \nfirearms, so long as that violation is the proximate cause \nof a plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nThat is not the case here, and the court below wrongly \nheld that this narrow exception applies.  Under its \nview, the Mexican government has plausibly alleged \nthat Petitioners aided and abetted each sale of a \nfirearm that ends up in cartel hands.  And they have \n\n13 \ndone so by taking certain actions permitted by U.S. \nlaw.  This is \u201ca far cry from the type of pervasive, \nsystemic, and culpable assistance\u201d that this Court\u2019s \nprecedent requires before imposing such sweeping \naiding-and-abetting liability.  Cf. Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 502 (2023).  Worse yet, the \ncourt below concluded that the Mexican government \nhas plausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 purported \naiding and abetting is the proximate cause of injuries \ncaused by third-party criminals.  If that decision is \naffirmed, the exception would swallow the statutory \nbar whole and allow a flood of suits that Congress \nintended to ban. \nFirst, the exception is not triggered here because the \nMexican government\u2019s aiding-and-abetting theory relies, \nat most, on passive indifference.  That is insufficient \nunder this Court\u2019s precedent.  See id. at 500. \nAs the Mexican government tells it, Petitioners are \n\u201caiding and abetting illegal downstream [firearms] \nsales,\u201d Pet. App. 299a, through business practices that, \nstanding alone, are legal.  For example, the Mexican \ngovernment alleges that Petitioners know their fire-\narms end up in the hands of certain dealers that, in \nturn, illegally sell to the cartels, yet they still \u201csupply \nth[ose] very dealers.\u201d  See id. at 301a.  What the \nMexican government leaves out is that Petitioners\u2019 \nsales are legal.  Indeed, all Petitioners (but one) are \nmanufacturers, which means they sell to licensed \ndistributors, who then sell to licensed retail dealers, \nwho finally sell to the public.  See id. at 140a (\u00b6 378).  \n(The lone distributor, of course, does not sell directly to \nthe public; it sells to retail dealers.  See id.) \nAs the court below conceded, \u201cthe complaint does \nnot allege [Petitioners\u2019] awareness of any particular \nunlawful sale.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  It brushed that aside, \n\n14 \nhowever, pointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Direct \nSales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 713 (1943).  See \nid. (\u201cBut neither did the convicted mail-order company \nin Direct Sales have such specific knowledge.\u201d).  There, \na morphine distributor sold to a doctor who, in turn, \nillegally resold the morphine.  See Direct Sales, 319 \nU.S. at 704-05.  This Court held that the distributor\u2014\nwhich sold the doctor enough morphine to prescribe in \na single day what an \u201caverage physician\u201d would use \nover an entire year\u2014could be held liable as a co-\nconspirator.  See id. at 706, 713-15.  As this Court \npointed out in Taamneh, providing a routine service in \nsuch an \u201cunusual way\u201d may amount to aiding and \nabetting.  See 598 U.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales, 319 \nU.S. at 707, 711-12, 714-15) (explaining that the \ndistributor in Direct Sales \u201cmailed morphine far in \nexcess of normal amounts\u201d).   \nHere, however, the Mexican government does not \nallege anything unusual about the way that Petitioners \n(usually indirectly) supply firearms dealers.  It does \nnot allege that Petitioners oversupply any particular \ndealer as the distributor in Direct Sales did.  Indeed, \nthe Mexican government does not allege that Petitioners \ntreat any one dealer different from other dealers.  \nRather, Petitioners\u2019 culpable conduct, according to the \nMexican government, is that they make their firearms \ngenerally available.  See, e.g., Pet. App. 79a (\u201cEach \n[Petitioner\u2019s] policy is to sell its guns to any and all \nFederal Firearms Licensees \u2026.\u201d).  They apparently \nshould, in the Mexican government\u2019s view, affirmatively \nrefuse to supply certain licensed dealers.  But this is \nno more than the \u201cpassive aid\u201d that online platforms \nprovide terrorist groups when they allow those groups \nto use their generally available platforms for illegal \nends.  See Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 499.  As this Court \n\n15 \nrecently held, such \u201cmere passive nonfeasance\u201d is not \nenough for aiding-and-abetting liability.  See id. at 500. \nThe same goes for Petitioners\u2019 other actions.  The \nMexican government claims that Petitioners are \naiding and abetting illegal sales by \u201cdesign[ing] their \nguns as military-style assault weapons.\u201d  See Pet. App. \n93a.  Those \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons\u201d are simply \nfirearms that fire semiautomatically and that \u201caccept \nlarge-capacity ammunition magazines.\u201d  See id. at 93a, \n95a-96a (\u00b6\u00b6 283, 288).  And critically, those firearms \nmay lawfully be sold in the United States.  Cf. id. at \n306a-09a (holding that Petitioners do not sell \nmachineguns without authorization, which the Gun \nControl Act prohibits).  By marketing them as \n\u201cmilitary-style weapons,\u201d Petitioners allegedly make \nthem more attractive to cartels.  See id. at 301a.  \nPetitioners also, the Mexican government claims, \nmake it easy to remove serial numbers on their \nfirearms\u2014another feature the cartels prefer.  See id.  \nBut as Petitioners pointed out, the Mexican government \ndoes not allege that they made these lawful design \ndecisions to aid and abet illegal sales to cartels.  See \nPet. 27-28.  Rather, their gripe is that Petitioners have \nnot affirmatively changed their business practices in \nresponse to the cartels\u2019 misconduct.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n104a (\u00b6 314) (\u201cDefendants could limit their sales of \nthese military-style assault weapons to military and \nperhaps some law enforcement units.  They do not.\u201d).  \nThis, again, is not the \u201cactive[] and substantial\u201d \nassistance that\u2019s necessary for aiding-and-abetting \nliability.  Cf. Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502. \nAt its core, the Mexican government\u2019s aiding-and-\nabetting theory relies on passive assistance: Petitioners \nsell firearms that drug cartels allegedly prefer, and \nthey have allegedly failed to take the steps necessary \n\n16 \n(according to a foreign government) to prevent those \nfirearms from ending up in cartel hands.  If that  \nwere enough to support aiding-and-abetting liability, \nPetitioners would, for example, need to stop distrib-\nuting semiautomatic firearms\u2014like the AR-15, the \nmost popular rifle in the United States\u2014to avoid \nliability.  After all, some of those firearms will always \nbe trafficked and used to commit crimes no matter \nwhat firearms companies do to stop that from \nhappening.  This Court\u2019s precedent, however, does not \nrequire Petitioners to take ever-increasing actions to \navoid liability.  Cf. id. at 500 (\u201c[B]oth tort and criminal \nlaw have long been leery of imposing aiding-and-\nabetting liability for mere passive nonfeasance.\u201d). \nSecond, even if the Mexican government had \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners aided and abetted \nunlawful sales, the statutory exception still would not \napply.  Mexico admits that its purported derivative \ninjuries were caused by third-party criminals.  That \nmeans Petitioners\u2019 actions are not the proximate cause \nof those injuries: the alleged harm is far too remote.  \nIndeed, shielding manufacturers from downstream \ncriminal acts\u2014over which they have no control\u2014was \na primary reason that Congress passed the Protection \nAct.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). \nThe sale of a product that a criminal then uses to \nharm a victim is ordinarily not the proximate cause of \nthe victim\u2019s injuries.  As the Judiciary Committee \nexplained when it passed the House version of the bill \nthat ultimately became the Protection Act, \u201c[t]he sale \nof a firearm merely furnishes the condition for a \ncrime.\u201d  H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 7.  So typically, \u201cas a \nmatter of law, there can be no finding of proximate \ncause in an action brought on behalf of a victim \nagainst the seller of the firearm used in the crime.\u201d  Id.  \n\n17 \nThis makes sense.  Generally, proximate cause limits \na person\u2019s liability to \u201cthe consequences of that \nperson\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 \nU.S. 258, 268 (1992) (\u201cHere we use \u2018proximate cause\u2019 to \nlabel generically the judicial tools used to limit a \nperson\u2019s responsibility for the consequences of that \nperson\u2019s own acts.\u201d).   \nBut the acts of third-party criminals, not Petitioners, \ncaused the Mexican government\u2019s alleged injuries \nhere.  The Mexican government does not allege that \nPetitioners themselves made illegal sales (let alone \nthat they sold directly to the cartels).  After all, \nPetitioners are licensed by the federal government, \nand they complied with the relevant regulatory regime \nby selling their products only to federally licensed \nwholesalers or retail dealers.  \u201c[T]hese legal transac-\ntions,\u201d the Judiciary Committee has explained, \u201care \nthe last stage in the process in which the manufactur-\ners exercise any control over their products.\u201d  H. Rep. \nNo. 109-124, at 10 (citation omitted); see also id. (\u201cThe \nonly sales in which [manufacturers] participate are to \nother Federal licensees, after which they can exercise \nno control over their product.\u201d  (citation omitted)).   \nOnce the firearms make their way to licensed retail \ndealers (who are two steps below manufacturers in the \ndistribution chain), those retailers must then conduct \na background check before selling to a buyer.  See id.  \nThe Mexican government was then purportedly injured \nonly after a firearm crossed an international border, \nlanded in cartel hands, and was used to commit a \ncrime.  These remote injuries are far downstream, \ncausally and geographically for that matter, from any-\nthing over which Petitioners had control; Petitioners\u2019 \nactions cannot be the proximate cause of such remote \nharm.  Cf. id. at 10, 13. \n\n18 \nThe court below nonetheless concluded that proximate \ncause was satisfied.  In its view, the complaint plausibly \nalleges that it was foreseeable that Petitioners\u2019 firearms \nwould end up in cartel hands (and that Petitioners \nintended as much).  See Pet. App. 313a.  But to say that \nsome firearms will end up in criminal hands is simply \nto state a fact of life.  See H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 24 \n(\u201cLike firearms manufacturers, knife and automobile \nmanufacturers, for example, are aware that a small \npercentage of their products will be misused by \ncriminals or intoxicated individuals, and knives and \nautomobiles cannot currently be feasibly designed to \nprevent such misuse.\u201d).  Nor does the Mexican govern-\nment\u2019s allegation that Petitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d \nfor their firearms to \u201cend up in the hands of Mexican \ncartels,\u201d see Pet. App. 313a, change the analysis.  As we \nexplained above, the Mexican government\u2019s theory relies \non Petitioners\u2019 passive\u2014lawful\u2014conduct.  Petitioners\u2019 \nallegedly culpable conduct is little more than making \ntheir lawful products generally available.   \nIf making an inherently dangerous product generally \navailable\u2014while knowing that some bad actors will \ninevitably misuse it\u2014is all the Protection Act\u2019s \nexception requires, Congress would have had no \nreason to include the proximate-cause requirement.  \nIndeed, under that limitless theory, every criminal \nmisuse of the product would be foreseeable, and the \nproximate-cause requirement would be superfluous.  It \ndefies basic logic to read the statute this way since one \nof the Protection Act\u2019s primary aims was preventing \nfirearms manufacturers from being held liable for the \nharms caused by third-party criminals.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(5). \nRather, as the Judiciary Committee pointed out, \nfirearms manufacturers may be liable for third-party \n\n19 \ncriminal acts only if there is a \u201cspecial relationship \nbetween criminal third parties and manufacturers.\u201d  \nSee H. Rep. No. 109-124, at 8.  There is no such special \nrelationship here.  Rather, the Mexican government\u2019s \ntheory faults Petitioners for making their products \ngenerally available through licensed wholesalers or \nretail dealers.  This falls well short of the special \nrelationship that\u2019s necessary to hold manufacturers \nresponsible for the criminal acts of others. \n*  *  * \nAccording to the court below, Petitioners\u2019 lawful \nsales of a legal product that eventually finds its way to \nbad actors constitutes aiding and abetting.  And that \npurported aiding and abetting\u2014in the form of legal \nbusiness practices\u2014is the proximate cause of harms \ncaused by third-party criminals.  This distorted view \nof both aiding and abetting and proximate cause, if \naccepted, would gut the Protection Act.   \nB. The Mexican government is attempting to \ndragoon courts into imposing regulations \nupon the firearms industry that Congress, \nso far, has declined to adopt \nThe Mexican government\u2014like the litigants that \nspurred Congress to pass the Protection Act\u2014is \nattempting to regulate the firearms industry under \nthe guise of judicially imposed injunctive relief.  \nIndeed, it asks an Article III court to enter a sweeping \ninjunction: one that requires Petitioners \u201cto take all \nnecessary action to abate the current and future harm \nthat their conduct is causing and would otherwise \ncause in the future in Mexico.\u201d  See Pet. App. 196a  \n(\u00b6 c).  The complaint offers a smorgasbord of injunctive \noptions.  We highlight just a few here. \n\n20 \n1.  One way that Petitioners allegedly \u201cassist and \nfacilitate\u201d illegal gun trafficking in Mexico, at least accord-\ning to its government, is by manufacturing so-called \n\u201cassault weapons\u201d such as the AR-15, see Pet. App. 94a-\n95a (\u00b6\u00b6 282-83), \u201cAmerica\u2019s most popular rifle,\u201d Pet. 8.  \nAllegedly, these semiautomatic weapons fire almost as \nrapidly as automatic weapons, id. at 97a (\u00b6 289), and \nPetitioners design them to \u201caccept large-capacity ammu-\nnition magazines,\u201d id. at 96a (\u00b6 288).  In the Mexican \ngovernment\u2019s view, the assault-rifle-large-magazine \ncombination \u201cenable[s] military-style assaults in which \nmany rounds can be fired in seconds.\u201d  Id.  In its words, \nPetitioners have \u201cdesigned their assault weapons to be \neffective people-killing machines.\u201d  Id. at 93a (\u00b6 280).  The \nMexican government\u2019s sweeping request for injunctive \nrelief, then, apparently asks the lower court to prohibit \nthe sale of semiautomatic firearms and magazines that \nhold twenty or more rounds.  See id. at 96a (\u00b6 288). \nBut it is not just the firearm type or magazine size.  \nThe Mexican government claims that Petitioners\u2019 \nfirearms are \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d because \u201cthey \nenable any person who gains access to them to fire \nthem.\u201d  Id. at 128a (\u00b6 355).  It thus asks a federal court \nto require Petitioners to redesign their firearms to \ninclude new features that would prevent unauthorized \nusers from firing them.  See id.; see also id. at 129a (\u00b6 \n357) (discussing a safety feature that prevents firing \nunless the user has a \u201cspecial key\u201d (citation omitted)); \nid. at 129a (\u00b6 358) (discussing \u201cfeatures that employ \nbiometric, radio frequency, or magnetic technologies\u201d).  \nFinally, the Mexican government believes that \nPetitioners could stop firearms trafficking into Mexico \nby mandating background checks when a firearm is \nresold.  See id. at 84a (\u00b6 245).  It claims that Petitioners \ncould adopt this reform without legislation, id. (\u00b6 246), \n\n21 \nyet it is unclear how.  Petitioners, of course, cannot \nmandate that private citizens conduct background \nchecks before selling a firearm to another citizen.  The \ncomplaint itself offers limited insight into this issue.  \nAs best the House can tell, the Mexican government \nseems to be asking an Article III court to require \nPetitioners to act in a way that will motivate private \ncitizens to use federally licensed retailers for any \nresales.  See id. at 83a-84a (\u00b6 245) (alleging that \nPetitioners could \u201cregulat[e] their own distribution \nsystems \u2026, as Judge Weinstein found\u201d); NAACP v. \nAcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 525 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003) (Weinstein, J.) (explaining that firearms manu-\nfacturers could, by contract, \u201cinstitute an industry-\nwide program of warranty revocation upon individual \nresale of handguns, unless the firearm is resold only \nthrough a storefront stocking handgun retailer so that \nsecondary sales are subject to background checks\u201d). \n2.  This ruse violates the separation of powers: the \nlegislative power that would be effectively exercised \nhere is vested in Congress, not courts.  At bottom, a \nforeign government is asking the Judicial Branch to \nimpose firearms restrictions that, so far, Congress has \nspecifically elected not to adopt. \nStart with the ability to sell semiautomatic weapons \nand large-capacity magazines.  As we explained \nabove, from 1994 to 2004, Congress restricted the sale \nand possession of each.  See Pub. L. No. 103-322,  \n\u00a7\u00a7 110102(a), 110103(a), 110105(2), 108 Stat. at 1996-\n97, 1998-99, 2000.  Congress considered multiple bills \nthat proposed making the restriction permanent or \n\n22 \nextending it beyond 2004\u2014it passed none.4  And since \nthat restriction expired in 2004, bills that would have \nagain prohibited such sales and possessions were \nintroduced in nearly every Congress.5  But while such \nproposals have been the subject of intense political \ndebate,6 not one has made it across the finish line.

See H.R. 1008, 117th Cong.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 101(3), 202(a) (2021).  But that bill failed to get out \nof the relevant House committee, let alone pass the \nentire House and Senate.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's trajectory toward a potential Supreme Court grant continues to evolve. The previous observation established a contested landscape with influential amicus support for both petitioners and the respondent. The new observation, which is an internal reasoning step ('THINK' action), does not introduce new external facts but refines my model of the information landscape by explicitly identifying the next critical knowledge gap: the substantive arguments within the amicus briefs.\n\n1.  **Completed Cert-Stage Legal Arguments (Beliefs Stable & Refined):** My core analysis of the petitioners' legal arguments\u2014focused on proximate causation, the *Taamneh* precedent, and the scope of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2014remains stable. The broad coalition of amicus support for these arguments is also a stable belief. However, my understanding of this information is now more nuanced.\n    *   **Core Petitioner Arguments (Stable):** The central legal questions regarding proximate cause, aiding-and-abetting liability, and the interpretation of PLCAA's \"predicate exception\" remain the primary drivers for a potential grant of certiorari.\n    *   **Amicus Coalition (Stable):** The existence of a diverse coalition (business, tort reform, constitutional, industry) supporting the petitioners remains a strong signal favoring a grant.\n    *   **Substance vs. Signal (New Refinement):** My belief state has advanced from simply identifying the *existence* of amicus filers to recognizing the critical need to analyze the *substance* of their arguments. The current observation clarifies that while I know *who* is arguing, I do not yet know *what* they are arguing in detail. My prediction model now requires this next layer of information to assess the quality and potential persuasiveness of the legal theories being advanced on both sides.\n\n2.  **Key Institutional Signals (Beliefs Stable & Refined):** My model for predicting a grant of certiorari, based on the contested nature of amicus support, is reinforced. The latest observation sharpens my focus on the specific role of the congressional amicus brief.\n    *   **Solicitor General Involvement (Stable but Unchanged):** The docket still shows no Call for the Views of the Solicitor General (CVSG). My belief remains stable that a CVSG is a probable future event and that the SG's recommendation will be a highly predictive signal.\n    *   **Amicus Support Landscape (Stable & Refined):** My belief that the amicus landscape is a contested field between influential actors is stable. The new observation refines this by forming a specific hypothesis about the content and strategic importance of the respondent's key amicus support.\n        *   **Petitioner Support (Stable):** The broad coalition supporting the petitioners sends a powerful signal that the First Circuit's decision is viewed as a significant threat across multiple sectors.\n        *   **Respondent Support (Belief Refined):** My belief about the amicus brief from 43 Members of Congress has become more specific. I previously identified it as a significant countervailing signal. I now believe its primary strategic purpose is to directly rebut the petitioners' statutory interpretation arguments by providing a competing narrative on **legislative intent**. I predict this brief will argue that Congress, in crafting the PLCAA's predicate exception, fully intended to allow lawsuits like Mexico's to proceed, thereby framing the First Circuit's ruling not as judicial overreach, but as a correct application of the statute's plain text and purpose. This makes the brief a crucial piece of evidence for how the Court might weigh the statutory arguments.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has transitioned from identifying the key players to hypothesizing about the specific content and strategic function of their arguments. The case for certiorari remains strong due to the clear conflict between influential groups. My focus has now shifted to the substance of the legal arguments, particularly the dueling interpretations of PLCAA's legislative intent, which I believe will be a central battleground in the briefs. My confidence in a final prediction is contingent on analyzing these substantive arguments, starting with the amicus brief from the Members of Congress.",

How do they address the proximate cause arguments, especially in light of *Taamneh*? How do they rebut the powerful separation-of-powers argument from the House?

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal and institutional landscape of this case has been dramatically reshaped by the new observation. A central hypothesis from my previous belief state has been directly contradicted, significantly strengthening the case for Supreme Court review and clarifying the primary legal battlegrounds.\n\n1.  **Reversal on Congressional Amicus Support (Belief Overturned & Replaced):** My prior belief was that the amicus brief from Members of Congress would support the respondent, Mexico, and argue that the PLCAA's predicate exception was intended to allow such lawsuits. This was incorrect. The observation reveals a brief filed by the **U.S. House of Representatives as an institution**, and it is filed **in support of the petitioners**.\n    *   **Previous Hypothesis (Invalidated):** I had predicted a brief from \"43 Members of Congress\" would argue for a broad interpretation of the predicate exception on behalf of the respondent.\n    *   **New Factual Belief:** The brief is from the U.S. House itself, authorized by its Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG). It forcefully argues that the First Circuit's decision must be reversed. This transforms what I thought was a key signal *against* certiorari into one of the strongest possible signals *in favor* of it.\n    *   **Nuance on Authorization (New Detail):** The brief was authorized on a party-line vote by the Republican leadership within BLAG. While it speaks for the House as an institution, this partisan split is a relevant detail that may slightly temper its persuasive weight compared to a unanimous filing. It also raises the possibility of a competing brief from Democratic members.\n\n2.  **Key Institutional Signals (Beliefs Refined & Strengthened):** The institutional pressure for the Supreme Court to take this case has increased substantially.\n    *   **Separation of Powers as a Central Issue (Belief Elevated):** The House's brief elevates the separation-of-powers doctrine from a background legal principle to a primary argument for reversal. It explicitly frames Mexico's lawsuit as an \"effort to use the judiciary to accomplish policy goals that advocates could not achieve through the legislative process\" and an attempt to \"dragoon the judiciary into exercising legislative power.\" The argument that the First Circuit's decision \"usurp[s] Congressional authority\" is a direct appeal to the Supreme Court's role in policing the boundaries between the branches.\n    *   **Solicitor General Involvement (Belief Stable but Contextualized):** My belief that a Call for the Views of the Solicitor General (CVSG) is likely remains stable. However, the context has changed. The Court now has a clear statement from the House of Representatives on the statute's meaning and purpose. The SG's view will be weighed against this powerful institutional statement, making the SG's potential recommendation even more critical.\n\n3.  **Completed Cert-Stage Legal Arguments (Beliefs Substantially Refined):** The substance of the petitioners' core arguments is now reinforced and detailed by the House's amicus brief, providing a clearer picture of the legal theories the Court will be asked to review.\n    *   **PLCAA's Purpose and Legislative Intent (Belief Refined):** My understanding of the PLCAA argument has moved beyond a simple textual analysis of the predicate exception. The House brief frames the entire statute as a defensive measure passed by Congress to \"preserve its legislative authority.\" It argues that the First Circuit's interpretation doesn't just misread a clause, but \"gut[s] the Protection Act\" entirely, turning it into a nullity. The brief presents Mexico's suit as the \"posterchild for what the Protection Act was meant to prevent.\" This narrative, coming from the House itself, provides a powerful argument about legislative intent.\n    *   **Proximate Cause and *Taamneh* (Belief Reinforced):** The brief solidifies the centrality of *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*. It explicitly cites *Taamneh* to attack the First Circuit's aiding-and-abetting and proximate cause analysis, arguing that the manufacturers' lawful sales are far too attenuated from the harm caused by cartels, which are \"textbook intervening causes.\" This reinforces my belief that the Court will see this case as a direct opportunity to apply or clarify its recent *Taamneh* framework in a new context.\n    *   **Legislative Inaction as Evidence (New Argument):** The brief introduces a new line of argument: using Congress's repeated *refusal* to pass stricter gun regulations (listing numerous failed bills) as affirmative evidence of legislative intent. It argues that Mexico is asking the courts to impose the very regulations that the legislature has considered and rejected, strengthening the separation-of-powers claim.\n\nIn summary, the observation has caused a significant update, reversing a key hypothesis and substantially increasing the perceived likelihood of a certiorari grant. The amicus support is not contested in the way I had imagined; instead, a powerful institutional actor, the U.S. House, has sided with the petitioners. The central legal conflict is now sharply defined: it is a clash between the First Circuit's expansive reading of a statutory exception and the House's institutional claim that this reading usurps legislative power and eviscerates a federal statute. My predictive focus now shifts to whether any countervailing amicus briefs will emerge, particularly from Democratic members of Congress or the Solicitor General, to challenge this potent narrative.",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v.

May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape has been refined, not by new external evidence, but by a critical internal assessment of my existing knowledge. While my beliefs about the petitioners' arguments are robust and well-supported, the latest observation highlights that my knowledge is one-sided. The primary update is the formal acknowledgment of specific, critical gaps in my understanding concerning the respondent's (Mexico's) legal theories.\n\n1.  **Petitioner-Side Arguments (Beliefs Stable and Well-Defined):** My beliefs regarding the strength and nature of the petitioners' case, as bolstered by the U.S. House of Representatives' amicus brief, remain stable.\n    *   **Institutional Weight:** The House's brief in support of the petitioners remains a powerful signal favoring certiorari and reversal. It frames the case as a defense of Congress's legislative authority against judicial overreach.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** The petitioners' core argument is that the First Circuit's interpretation of the PLCAA's \"predicate exception\" effectively nullifies the entire statute, turning it inside out. The House's brief provides strong evidence of legislative intent, arguing Mexico's suit is precisely what the PLCAA was enacted to prevent.\n    *   **Controlling Precedent:** *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* is the central precedent for the petitioners' proximate cause argument. They will argue that the gun manufacturers' lawful domestic sales are far too attenuated from the harm caused by cartels, which constitute intervening criminal acts that break the causal chain.\n\n2.  **Respondent-Side Counter-Arguments (Beliefs Now Framed as Explicit Uncertainty):** The previous observation did not provide Mexico's arguments, but it made clear what those arguments *must* address. My belief state now formally incorporates these key questions as areas of high uncertainty, which are critical to resolving before a final prediction can be made.\n    *   **Uncertainty 1: Mexico's Theory of the PLCAA Predicate Exception.** How does Mexico argue that its allegations meet the exception for a \"knowing violation of a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing\" of firearms? Do they argue the manufacturers' business practices constitute a continuous course of conduct that aids and abets illegal trafficking, thereby violating federal law? Understanding their specific textual and structural interpretation of the exception is paramount.\n    *   **Uncertainty 2: Mexico's Theory of Proximate Causation Post-*Taamneh*.** How does Mexico plan to distinguish its case from *Taamneh*? They must argue that the manufacturers' actions were not merely passive or general business activities, but rather \"conscious, meaningful assistance\" directed at facilitating an illegal market. I need to see the specific facts they allege that create a direct link between the manufacturers' marketing/distribution practices and the arming of cartels, sufficient to overcome the intervening acts of traffickers.\n    *   **Uncertainty 3: Mexico's Rebuttal to the Separation-of-Powers Argument.** How will Mexico counter the potent argument from the House that this lawsuit is an end-run around the legislative process? They will likely frame this as a standard application of tort law to redress a concrete injury, arguing that courts are fully competent to hear such cases and that the PLCAA's exception explicitly allows for it. They must portray their suit not as an attempt to set foreign or domestic policy, but as a straightforward effort to seek remedy for harm caused by allegedly unlawful conduct.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved from being confident about the petitioners' case to being acutely aware of the questions their case raises for the respondent. The legal battle is clearly defined, but I have only heard one side. The most valuable future observation would be the Brief for Respondent (Mexico), as it would directly address these three major areas of uncertainty and allow for a more balanced and informed prediction of the Court's likely ruling.",

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the respondent's Brief in Opposition has been highly informative, directly addressing and resolving the three critical areas of uncertainty I previously identified. My belief state has evolved from a one-sided understanding of the petitioners' case to a much more balanced and nuanced view of the legal clash. I now have a clear picture of both sides' core arguments regarding the PLCAA, proximate causation, and the role of the judiciary.\n\n1.  **Petitioner-Side Arguments (Beliefs Stable, Contextualized):** My understanding of the petitioners' case, supported by the House of Representatives' amicus brief, remains stable, but is now contextualized by Mexico's direct rebuttal.\n    *   **Institutional Weight & Separation of Powers:** The House's argument that the First Circuit's decision represents judicial overreach remains a powerful signal favoring the petitioners. However, this is now directly countered by Mexico's argument that its lawsuit is not an attempt to set policy, but a straightforward tort action that falls squarely within a statutory exception *created by Congress*. Mexico bolsters this by citing the PLCAA's own legislative history, quoting sponsors who stated the act was not intended to protect manufacturers from liability for their own \"negligent or criminal conduct.\"\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation (PLCAA):** The petitioners' argument that the First Circuit's reading of the \"predicate exception\" nullifies the statute's purpose is still central. They frame Mexico's suit as precisely the kind of broad liability action the PLCAA was designed to prevent.\n    *   **Controlling Precedent (Proximate Cause):** *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* remains the petitioners' cornerstone precedent. They will continue to argue that their lawful, domestic sales are too attenuated from the harm caused by cartels, whose intervening criminal acts break the causal chain.\n\n2.  **Respondent-Side Counter-Arguments (Beliefs Updated, Uncertainties Resolved):** Mexico's Brief in Opposition has filled the significant gaps in my knowledge, transforming my areas of uncertainty into well-defined counter-arguments.\n    *   **Theory of the PLCAA Predicate Exception (Formerly Uncertainty 1):** Mexico's theory is now clear. They are not alleging mere knowledge or negligence. Their claim is that the petitioners engaged in *affirmative and intentional conduct* that constitutes aiding and abetting the unlawful trafficking of firearms, thus triggering the predicate exception (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)). The alleged conduct is specific:\n        *   **Knowingly Supplying Bad Actors:** Continuing to supply a small subset of dealers known to be responsible for the vast majority of crime guns.\n        *   **Targeted Marketing & Design:** Creating products like the \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, allegedly designed to appeal specifically to the cartel market.\n        *   **Facilitating Unlawful Practices:** Resisting safety measures and doubling down on sales practices known to be exploited by traffickers.\n        This is a crucial clarification: Mexico frames its case as being about *unlawful commerce in arms*, which the PLCAA explicitly does not protect.\n    *   **Theory of Proximate Causation Post-*Taamneh* (Formerly Uncertainty 2):** Mexico's strategy to distinguish *Taamneh* is to contrast the \"passive\" and \"general\" nature of the services provided by the defendants in that case with the gun manufacturers' alleged conduct here. They argue this case is \"as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\" Their argument is that the petitioners' actions\u2014deliberately designing, marketing, and distributing their products in a way that cultivates and profits from an illegal market\u2014constitute \"conscious, meaningful assistance\" that creates a direct causal link to the harm suffered by Mexico. The harm is not abstract; Mexico alleges specific, quantifiable damages (e.g., deaths of police/military, damage to equipment) caused by weapons traced directly back to the petitioners.\n    *   **Rebuttal to Separation-of-Powers (Formerly Uncertainty 3):** Mexico directly refutes the idea that its lawsuit is an end-run around Congress. By grounding their claim in the PLCAA's predicate exception and citing legislative history, they argue they are asking the court to *enforce* the law as written, not create new policy. They portray their suit as a standard application of tort law to redress a concrete injury, a function courts are competent to perform and which Congress explicitly preserved.\n\n3.  **New Beliefs (Procedural Posture and Certworthiness):** A significant new element from the observation is Mexico's focus on why the Supreme Court should deny certiorari at this stage.\n    *   **Prematurity:** Mexico argues forcefully that the case is at the motion-to-dismiss stage and a factual record has not been developed. They contend that the petitioners' challenges are best addressed after discovery, summary judgment, and a potential trial. This is a standard and often effective argument against early-stage review.\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** Mexico asserts that the petitioners have failed to identify a single appellate court decision that conflicts with the First Circuit's interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception, a key factor the Court considers when granting review. They dismiss the cases cited by petitioners as predating the PLCAA or applying different state laws to different facts.\n\nIn summary, my belief state is now far more complete. The legal battle is not merely about whether a gun manufacturer can be sued for a gun's misuse, but whether Mexico has plausibly alleged that these specific manufacturers *aided and abetted* illegal sales through a pattern of intentional business practices. The case now appears to hinge on whether the Supreme Court sees Mexico's allegations as sufficient to distinguish this case from *Taamneh* and fit within the PLCAA's predicate exception, or whether it will agree with the petitioners that this is a non-justiciable foreign policy question disguised as a tort claim. The procedural posture adds a critical layer of uncertainty regarding whether the Court will even agree to hear the case at this time.",
