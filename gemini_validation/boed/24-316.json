      "Does the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force violate the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause?",

    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires private insurers to cover certain preventive-care services without cost sharing. Rather than defining these services directly, the ACA empowers three agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine required services: the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The Task Force consists of sixteen volunteer experts serving four-year terms, ACIP has fifteen members selected by the HHS Secretary, and HRSA operates through offices and bureaus reporting to the HHS Secretary.\n\nOver the years, these agencies issued various preventive care recommendations, including ACIP\u2019s 2007 recommendation for HPV vaccines, HRSA\u2019s 2011 guidelines for contraceptive coverage, and the Task Force\u2019s 2019 recommendation for HIV prevention drugs (PrEP). Four individuals and two Christian-based businesses in Texas challenged these requirements, arguing that mandatory coverage of these services violated their religious beliefs by making them \u201ccomplicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs filed suit in 2020 against the federal government and various department secretaries, primarily arguing that the structure of these agencies violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The district court ruled in their favor regarding the Task Force but rejected their challenges to ACIP and HRSA, and both parties appealed. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Task Force\u2019s structure violated the Appointments Clause and upheld the injunction against enforcing its recommendations, but reversed the district court\u2019s universal remedies and remanded for further consideration of whether HHS properly ratified ACIP and HRSA\u2019s recommendations.",

This dramatically reduces uncertainty about how to proceed and focuses future information gathering on the most critical documents, thus providing significant information on how to solve this specific task.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable strategy for SCOTUS prediction tasks. The workflow of (1) identifying core legal doctrines, (2) hypothesizing based on court composition, (3) identifying key precedents, and (4) planning to retrieve primary source documents (party briefs) is a powerful and repeatable design pattern. Validating this approach provides significant information about what constitutes an effective general strategy (D).\n\nJoint EIG is the sum of these two values, reflecting that this is an excellent action for both the immediate task and for learning better long-term strategies.",

However, to make a specific prediction, I must understand the precise arguments the parties are making. This action targets the petitioner's (the government's) brief, which will reveal their core legal theory on the Appointments Clause question. This information is critical for the task (Task EIG = 0.9) because it will allow me to directly map their arguments against the known jurisprudence and judicial philosophies of the individual justices, moving my analysis from a general hypothesis to a specific, evidence-based forecast. The design gain is also significant (Design EIG = 0.5) because it reinforces a core strategic principle: after identifying the legal framework, the next essential step is to analyze how the parties frame their arguments within that framework. Understanding the specific tactics the government uses to distinguish this case from adverse precedents like *Lucia* and *Free Enterprise Fund* provides a generalizable insight into effective (or ineffective) appellate advocacy, which is a key feature in any SCOTUS prediction model.",

The question presented is as follows: \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appoint-\nments Clause, U.S. Const. Art.

App. 1a-48a) \nis reported at 104 F.4th 930.  The memoranda opinions \nand orders of the district court (Pet. App. 49a-84a, 85a-\n136a) are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d 613 and 627 F. \nSupp. 3d 624.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJune 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on September 19, 2024, and granted on January 10, \n2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced at App., infra, 1a-7a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, ensures democratic accountability.  A gov-\nernment official who exercises continuing, \u201csignificant \nauthority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d is \nan officer of the United States.  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. \n237, 245 (2018) (citation omitted).  And all officers who \nwield executive power on the President\u2019s behalf must \noperate within \u201ca clear and effective chain of command\u201d \nleading up to the President.  United States v. Arthrex, \nInc., 594 U.S. 1, 11 (2021) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 498 \n(2010)).  The President must be able to hold all his subor-\ndinates fully accountable, and the President, in turn, is \nfully accountable to the People.   \nOfficers who have the \u201cpower to render a final deci-\nsion on behalf of the United States\u201d and answer only to \nthe President are principal officers.  Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 665 (1997).  As such, they must be \nappointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and \nconsent\u2014a method that holds both actors politically ac-\ncountable for principal officers\u2019 ensuing decisions.  Id. \nat 659-660.  By contrast, inferior officers can also be ap-\npointed by \u201cthe President alone,  * * *  the Courts of Law, \nor  * * *  the Heads of Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2.  The Framers afforded that more stream-\nlined method of appointment to assuage concerns that \nsuch \u201coffices\u201d would \u201cbec[o]me numerous, and sudden \nremovals necessary.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 12 (quoting \nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879)).  \n\n3 \n \nBut that method imposes adequate accountability only \nif principal officers continue to supervise inferior offic-\ners and retain ultimate responsibility for legally binding \ndecisions.   \nThis case turns on how to classify members of the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (Task \nForce).  The Task Force sits within the Public Health \nService, which is itself a component of the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS).  All agree that \nTask Force members are officers of some kind, because \nthey exercise significant, continuing governmental au-\nthority.  Specifically, they can make recommendations \nconcerning preventive services that, by operation of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. \nL. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), health-insurance \nissuers and group health plans must cover without re-\nquiring cost sharing by patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).   \nThe question is whether Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers, or instead principal \nofficers whose appointments are unconstitutional be-\ncause they are not presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed.  The answer is straightforward:  Task Force \nmembers are inferior officers, because the Secretary  \nof HHS\u2014a quintessential principal officer\u2014remains \nresponsible for final decisions about whether Task \nForce recommendations will be legally binding on in-\nsurance issuers and group health plans.  The Secretary \ncan remove Task Force members at will, for any  \nreason\u2014perhaps the most \u201cpowerful tool for control\u201d of \ntheir conduct.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  And the Sec-\nretary can review the Task Force\u2019s preventive-services \nrecommendations and decide to deny them legal force \nunder the ACA before those recommendations have \nbinding effect.  Taken together, those controls give the \n\n4 \n \nSecretary, not the Task Force, ultimate responsibility \nfor whether Task Force recommendations become final, \nbinding decisions.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling \ndeclaring the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitutional \nerroneously dismissed both of those means of secretar-\nial control, which create a chain of supervisory account-\nability through the Secretary to the President. \nEven if the statutory framework meant that Task \nForce members were principal officers, the Appoint-\nments Clause violation would be cured by severing the \nprovision that the court of appeals regarded as preclud-\ning principal-officer review of the Task Force\u2019s deci-\nsions.  That is the cure that this Court chose in Arthrex.  \nSee 594 U.S. at 26.  Yet the Fifth Circuit declined to fol-\nlow that path, instead viewing the Task Force as unlaw-\nfully exercising governmental authority for nearly 15 \nyears and barring the Task Force from continuing to \nexercise such authority absent new legislation.  This \nCourt should at a minimum reverse the severability \nholding and allow the Task Force to make recommen-\ndations that will have legal effect only under appropri-\nate supervision by the Secretary.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Since 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS \nhas relied on the Task Force\u2014a group composed of \u201cna-\ntionally recognized non-Federal experts in prevention \nand evidence-based medicine\u201d\u2014to develop recommen-\ndations about preventive health services.  J.A. 37.  Pre-\nventive health services include screenings and medica-\ntions to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cservices \ncan help people avoid acute illness, identify and treat \nchronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier  \ndetection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014 \n\n5 \n \nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2.  \nIn 1999, Congress codified the Task Force\u2019s role by \nexpressly authorizing the Director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency \nwithin the Public Health Service, to \u201cperiodically con-\nvene\u201d the Task Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality \nAct of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 \nStat. 1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  Congress also \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  As a thresh-\nold step, the Task Force \u201cselects and prioritizes topics \nfor review.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 77 (Jan. 28, 2022).  \u201cAny-\none,\u201d including \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201corganizations,\u201d \u201ccan \nnominate a new topic for Task Force consideration.\u201d  \nIbid. \nAfter the Task Force chooses a topic, creates a re-\nsearch plan, and reviews the evidence, the Task Force \nmay formulate a \u201cdraft recommendation statement\u201d for \na particular preventive service.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 81.  \nThe Task Force then posts the \u201cdraft recommendation \nstatement,\u201d along with the relevant \u201cevidence,\u201d on its \nwebsite \u201cfor public comment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cDuring the com-\nment period, any member of the public may submit com-\nments.\u201d  Ibid.  Based on those comments, the Task Force \nmay \u201cpropose revisions to the recommendation.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n6 \n \nAll Task Force members then vote on the final rec-\nommendation.  See J.A. 50-51.  If adopted, the Task \nForce posts the recommendation on its website.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 81.  The Task Force also publishes its rec-\nommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical Preventive Ser-\nvices,\u201d a resource for medical professionals, Congress, \nand other policymakers.  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).   \nWith the 2010 enactment of the ACA, Congress for \nthe first time provided that some of the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations could have binding legal effects.  Spe-\ncifically, the ACA requires health-insurance issuers and \ngroup health plans to cover certain preventive services \nwithout imposing copayments, deductibles, or other \ncost-sharing charges on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage without cost sharing \nfor \u201cevidence-based items or services that have in effect \na rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of \nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).1   \n2. The applicable statutes enable secretarial control \nover the Task Force and the process by which its rec-\nommendations may become legally binding.  The Secre-\ntary can appoint Task Force members and has appointed \nthe 16 members currently serving on the Task Force.  \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that it \ndeems to have a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations for services that have at least a moderate certainty \nof a moderate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services \nthat have at least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.  J.A. \n45-46. \n\n7 \n \nSecretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment \nand Prospective Appointment: Appointment Affidavit \n(June 28, 2023) (Appointment Ratification), https:// \nperma.cc/8TAA-7AMN.  Task Force members serve \nfour-year terms.  See J.A. 39.  Significantly, the Secre-\ntary can remove them at will before the end of their \nterm, because there are no statutory restrictions on a \nmember\u2019s removal.  See 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & \nSupp. IV 2022).   \nThe ACA also gives the Secretary other powers to \nsupervise Task Force recommendations.  The statute \nprovides that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall establish a mini-\nmum interval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation  * * *  is issued\u201d and the date on which issuers \nand plans must cover the recommended service without \ncost sharing for a new plan year.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(1).  The minimum interval established by the Sec-\nretary \u201cshall not be less than 1 year.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(2).  Under current regulations, the interval for \nmost recommendations is one year.  See 45 C.F.R. \n147.130(b)(1).    \nIn addition, Congress has vested the Secretary with \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, 80 Stat. 1610 (Reor-\nganization Plan), \u201call functions of the Public Health Ser-\nvice\u201d and of its \u201cofficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d \nwere transferred to the Secretary, \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Act of Oct. 19, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 \n(ratifying the Reorganization Plan as law).  Congress \nhas also empowered the Secretary to \u201cmake such provi-\nsions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the per-\nformance of any of the functions transferred to him by \nthe provisions of this reorganization plan by any officer, \nemployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or \n\n8 \n \nHHS.  Reorganization Plan \u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  The Sec-\nretary is further authorized to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, and to \u201ccarry \nout\u201d AHRQ\u2019s mission and duties by \u201cacting through [its] \nDirector,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 299(a).   \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. The Task Force\u2019s current \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations\u2014which the Secretary has allowed to take effect \nand has since expressly ratified\u2014cover more than 50 \npreventive services.

Under the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. \n119, health-insurance-coverage issuers and group health \nplans must cover certain preventive services recom-\nmended by the Task Force without imposing any cost-\nsharing requirements on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appoint-\nments Clause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, and in de-\nclining to sever the statutory provision that it found to \nunduly insulate the Task Force from the HHS Secre-\ntary\u2019s supervision.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING  \nPetitioners (defendants-appellants/cross-appellees \nbelow) are Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in his official capac-\nity as Secretary of Health and Human Services; Scott \nBessent, in his official capacity as Secretary of the \nTreasury; Vincent Micone, in his official capacity as \nActing Secretary of Labor; and the United States of \nAmerica.*   \nRespondents \n(plaintiffs-appellees/cross-appellants \nbelow) are Braidwood Management, Inc.; John Scott \nKelley; Kelley Orthodontics; Ashley Maxwell; Zach \nMaxwell; and Joel Starnes.  Additional respondents \n(plaintiffs-cross-appellants below) are Joel Miller and \nGregory Scheideman.  \n \n \n* Secretary Kennedy, Secretary Bessent, and Acting Secretary \nMicone were substituted as parties for their predecessors in office \npursuant to Rule 35.3 of the Rules of this Court. \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ...................... 2 \nIntroduction ................................................................................... 2 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 4 \nB. \nThe present controversy ................................................. 8 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument ..................................................................................... 19 \nI. \nTask Force members are inferior officers .................. 19 \nA.

The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on September 19, 2024, and granted on January 10, \n2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced at App., infra, 1a-7a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, ensures democratic accountability.  A gov-\nernment official who exercises continuing, \u201csignificant \nauthority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d is \nan officer of the United States.  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. \n237, 245 (2018) (citation omitted).  And all officers who \nwield executive power on the President\u2019s behalf must \noperate within \u201ca clear and effective chain of command\u201d \nleading up to the President.  United States v. Arthrex, \nInc., 594 U.S. 1, 11 (2021) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 498 \n(2010)).  The President must be able to hold all his subor-\ndinates fully accountable, and the President, in turn, is \nfully accountable to the People.   \nOfficers who have the \u201cpower to render a final deci-\nsion on behalf of the United States\u201d and answer only to \nthe President are principal officers.  Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 665 (1997).  As such, they must be \nappointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and \nconsent\u2014a method that holds both actors politically ac-\ncountable for principal officers\u2019 ensuing decisions.  Id. \nat 659-660.  By contrast, inferior officers can also be ap-\npointed by \u201cthe President alone,  * * *  the Courts of Law, \nor  * * *  the Heads of Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2.  The Framers afforded that more stream-\nlined method of appointment to assuage concerns that \nsuch \u201coffices\u201d would \u201cbec[o]me numerous, and sudden \nremovals necessary.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 12 (quoting \nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879)).  \n\n3 \n \nBut that method imposes adequate accountability only \nif principal officers continue to supervise inferior offic-\ners and retain ultimate responsibility for legally binding \ndecisions.   \nThis case turns on how to classify members of the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (Task \nForce).  The Task Force sits within the Public Health \nService, which is itself a component of the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS).  All agree that \nTask Force members are officers of some kind, because \nthey exercise significant, continuing governmental au-\nthority.  Specifically, they can make recommendations \nconcerning preventive services that, by operation of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. \nL. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), health-insurance \nissuers and group health plans must cover without re-\nquiring cost sharing by patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).   \nThe question is whether Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers, or instead principal \nofficers whose appointments are unconstitutional be-\ncause they are not presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed.  The answer is straightforward:  Task Force \nmembers are inferior officers, because the Secretary  \nof HHS\u2014a quintessential principal officer\u2014remains \nresponsible for final decisions about whether Task \nForce recommendations will be legally binding on in-\nsurance issuers and group health plans.  The Secretary \ncan remove Task Force members at will, for any  \nreason\u2014perhaps the most \u201cpowerful tool for control\u201d of \ntheir conduct.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  And the Sec-\nretary can review the Task Force\u2019s preventive-services \nrecommendations and decide to deny them legal force \nunder the ACA before those recommendations have \nbinding effect.  Taken together, those controls give the \n\n4 \n \nSecretary, not the Task Force, ultimate responsibility \nfor whether Task Force recommendations become final, \nbinding decisions.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling \ndeclaring the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitutional \nerroneously dismissed both of those means of secretar-\nial control, which create a chain of supervisory account-\nability through the Secretary to the President. \nEven if the statutory framework meant that Task \nForce members were principal officers, the Appoint-\nments Clause violation would be cured by severing the \nprovision that the court of appeals regarded as preclud-\ning principal-officer review of the Task Force\u2019s deci-\nsions.  That is the cure that this Court chose in Arthrex.  \nSee 594 U.S. at 26.  Yet the Fifth Circuit declined to fol-\nlow that path, instead viewing the Task Force as unlaw-\nfully exercising governmental authority for nearly 15 \nyears and barring the Task Force from continuing to \nexercise such authority absent new legislation.  This \nCourt should at a minimum reverse the severability \nholding and allow the Task Force to make recommen-\ndations that will have legal effect only under appropri-\nate supervision by the Secretary.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Since 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS \nhas relied on the Task Force\u2014a group composed of \u201cna-\ntionally recognized non-Federal experts in prevention \nand evidence-based medicine\u201d\u2014to develop recommen-\ndations about preventive health services.  J.A. 37.  Pre-\nventive health services include screenings and medica-\ntions to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cservices \ncan help people avoid acute illness, identify and treat \nchronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier  \ndetection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014 \n\n5 \n \nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2.  \nIn 1999, Congress codified the Task Force\u2019s role by \nexpressly authorizing the Director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency \nwithin the Public Health Service, to \u201cperiodically con-\nvene\u201d the Task Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality \nAct of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 \nStat. 1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  Congress also \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  As a thresh-\nold step, the Task Force \u201cselects and prioritizes topics \nfor review.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 77 (Jan. 28, 2022).  \u201cAny-\none,\u201d including \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201corganizations,\u201d \u201ccan \nnominate a new topic for Task Force consideration.\u201d  \nIbid. \nAfter the Task Force chooses a topic, creates a re-\nsearch plan, and reviews the evidence, the Task Force \nmay formulate a \u201cdraft recommendation statement\u201d for \na particular preventive service.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 81.  \nThe Task Force then posts the \u201cdraft recommendation \nstatement,\u201d along with the relevant \u201cevidence,\u201d on its \nwebsite \u201cfor public comment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cDuring the com-\nment period, any member of the public may submit com-\nments.\u201d  Ibid.  Based on those comments, the Task Force \nmay \u201cpropose revisions to the recommendation.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n6 \n \nAll Task Force members then vote on the final rec-\nommendation.  See J.A. 50-51.  If adopted, the Task \nForce posts the recommendation on its website.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 81.  The Task Force also publishes its rec-\nommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical Preventive Ser-\nvices,\u201d a resource for medical professionals, Congress, \nand other policymakers.  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).   \nWith the 2010 enactment of the ACA, Congress for \nthe first time provided that some of the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations could have binding legal effects.  Spe-\ncifically, the ACA requires health-insurance issuers and \ngroup health plans to cover certain preventive services \nwithout imposing copayments, deductibles, or other \ncost-sharing charges on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage without cost sharing \nfor \u201cevidence-based items or services that have in effect \na rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of \nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).1   \n2. The applicable statutes enable secretarial control \nover the Task Force and the process by which its rec-\nommendations may become legally binding.  The Secre-\ntary can appoint Task Force members and has appointed \nthe 16 members currently serving on the Task Force.  \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that it \ndeems to have a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations for services that have at least a moderate certainty \nof a moderate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services \nthat have at least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.

Task Force members serve \nfour-year terms.  See J.A. 39.  Significantly, the Secre-\ntary can remove them at will before the end of their \nterm, because there are no statutory restrictions on a \nmember\u2019s removal.  See 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & \nSupp. IV 2022).   \nThe ACA also gives the Secretary other powers to \nsupervise Task Force recommendations.  The statute \nprovides that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall establish a mini-\nmum interval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation  * * *  is issued\u201d and the date on which issuers \nand plans must cover the recommended service without \ncost sharing for a new plan year.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(1).  The minimum interval established by the Sec-\nretary \u201cshall not be less than 1 year.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(2).  Under current regulations, the interval for \nmost recommendations is one year.  See 45 C.F.R. \n147.130(b)(1).    \nIn addition, Congress has vested the Secretary with \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, 80 Stat. 1610 (Reor-\nganization Plan), \u201call functions of the Public Health Ser-\nvice\u201d and of its \u201cofficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d \nwere transferred to the Secretary, \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Act of Oct. 19, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 \n(ratifying the Reorganization Plan as law).  Congress \nhas also empowered the Secretary to \u201cmake such provi-\nsions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the per-\nformance of any of the functions transferred to him by \nthe provisions of this reorganization plan by any officer, \nemployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or \n\n8 \n \nHHS.

The Present Controversy \n1. The Task Force\u2019s current \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations\u2014which the Secretary has allowed to take effect \nand has since expressly ratified\u2014cover more than 50 \npreventive services.  U.S. Preventive Servs. Task Force, \nA & B Recommendations, https://perma.cc/8398-UNHV.  \nThose services include screenings to detect lung, cervical, \nand colorectal cancer; screenings to detect diabetes; \nstatin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease \nand stroke; physical therapy to prevent falls by older \nadults; and eye ointment to prevent blindness-causing \ninfections in newborns.  Ibid.  Since 2010, millions of \nAmericans have received coverage for such preventive \nservices without cost sharing.  See J.A. 62. \nRespondents are four individuals and two small busi-\nnesses that object to the requirement that health- \ninsurance issuers and group health plans cover certain \npreventive services.  Pet. App. 7a.  Five of the six re-\nspondents \u201cdo not currently participate in the health \ncare market.\u201d  Id. at 62a; see D. Ct. Docs. 111-1, \u00b6 5, \n111-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 111-3, \u00b6 5 (Jan. 6, 2023).  They object on \nreligious grounds to the ACA\u2019s requirement that issu-\ners and plans cover certain HIV-prevention medica-\ntions for which the Task Force has issued an \u201cA\u201d rec-\nommendation that has taken effect.  Pet. App. 7a-8a.  \nAnd they wish to purchase or provide health insurance \nthat excludes coverage for such medications consistent \nwith their faiths.  Ibid.   \n\n9 \n \nBraidwood Management is the only respondent that \ncurrently participates in the health-insurance market.  \nPet. App. 55a.  Braidwood offers coverage to its approx-\nimately 70 employees through a self-insured plan.  Ibid.  \nIts owner wishes to exclude from that plan coverage of \ncertain HIV-prevention medications and to \u201cimpose co-\npays or deductibles for preventive care.\u201d  Id. at 55a-56a.   \n2. Respondents filed this suit in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas.  Re-\nspondents prevailed on a claim under the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. \n2000bb et seq., securing a party-specific injunction against \nenforcement of the requirement to cover without cost \nsharing certain HIV-prevention medications.  See Pet. \nApp. 50a, 68a-72a, 84a, 129a-134a.  The government did \nnot appeal that RFRA decision.   \nAs relevant here, respondents also challenged the \nTask Force\u2019s structure as violating the Appointments \nClause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, because, in their \nview, Task Force members are principal officers of the \nUnited States who have not been appointed by the Pres-\nident with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  Respondents\u2019 operative complaint seeks in-\njunctive and declaratory relief but does not seek vaca-\ntur under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \n5 U.S.C. 706(2).  J.A. 31-32.2   \n \n2 Respondents asserted Appointments Clause challenges to two \nother bodies within HHS\u2014the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration (HRSA)\u2014that issue recommendations and guidelines \nthat insurance issuers and group health plans are required to cover \nwithout cost sharing.  See Pet. App. 5a-6a, 8a; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(2)-(4).  The district court rejected those Appointments Clause \nchallenges, Pet. App. 102a-106a, but the court of appeals reversed \nand remanded for consideration of respondents\u2019 argument that the \n\n10 \n \nThe district court held that Task Force members are \nimproperly appointed principal officers and granted \nsummary judgment to respondents.  Pet. App. 115a.  \nThe court acknowledged that \u201cno statute forbids\u201d the \n\u201cSecretary[] or AHRQ Director from firing any mem-\nber of\u200a\u201d the Task Force.  Id. at 119a.  But the court rea-\nsoned that Task Force members \u201chave no superior,\u201d be-\ncause the Secretary \u201cneither directs nor supervises [the \nTask Force] or its members.\u201d  Id. at 115a-116a.   \nThe district court declined to construe or sever the \nrelevant statutory provision to avoid the identified Ap-\npointments Clause problem.  Pet. App. 80a-82a.  Specif-\nically, the court rejected the government\u2019s argument \nthat the provision rendering Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cindependent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6), should be construed to allow the Secretary \nto review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommenda-\ntions before they bind insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans.  Pet. App. 81a.  The district court recog-\nnized that this Court in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1 (2021), had \u201ccur[ed]\u201d an Appointments Clause \nviolation by severing a statutory provision to ensure \nthat decisions of administrative patent judges (APJs) \nwould \u201cbe subject to the review of the [Patent and \nTrademark Office] Director.\u201d  Pet. App. 81a.  But the \ndistrict court deemed Arthrex \u201cinapplicable\u201d based on \nits view that the Task Force is not \u201csubject to the Sec-\nretary\u2019s \u2018supervision and direction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).   \n \nAPA required public notice and comment for the Secretary\u2019s ratifi-\ncation of ACIP and HRSA recommendations and guidelines, id. at \n43a-47a.  Those separate claims are not before the Court.   \n\n11 \n \nAs a remedy, the district court not only granted \nparty-specific relief, but also ordered \u201c[u]niversal\u201d re-\nlief based on its reading of 5 U.S.C. 706(2), even though \nrespondents had not raised an APA claim in their oper-\native complaint.  Pet. App. 72a (emphasis omitted).  The \ncourt vacated \u201c[a]ll agency action taken to implement or \nenforce the preventive care coverage requirements in \nresponse to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 recommendation by the  * * *  \nTask Force on or after March 23, 2010.\u201d  Id. at 83a.  The \ncourt also granted a nationwide injunction barring the \ngovernment from \u201cimplementing or enforcing\u201d the \nACA\u2019s preventive-services \u201ccoverage requirements in \nresponse to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating from the Task Force in \nthe future.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. The government sought a stay pending appeal of \nthe district court\u2019s universal remedies.  After the court \nof appeals heard oral argument on the government\u2019s \nstay motion, the parties stipulated to a stay of the uni-\nversal remedies, and the court entered a corresponding \nstay.  C.A. Doc. 153-2 (June 13, 2023).   \nIn addition, while the appeal was pending, the Secre-\ntary ratified the AHRQ Director\u2019s appointment of the \ncurrent members of the Task Force and appointed \nthose members himself on a prospective basis.  See Ap-\npointment Ratification, supra.  In January 2022, the \nSecretary had separately ratified all Task Force \u201cA\u201d \nand \u201cB\u201d recommendations then currently in effect.  J.A. \n34-35.  \n4. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \nholding that the Task Force\u2019s structure violates the Ap-\npointments Clause, but reversed the district court\u2019s \ngrant of universal relief.  Pet. App. 1a-48a.   \na. The court of appeals held that Task Force mem-\nbers are principal officers who had not been properly \nappointed.  Pet. App. 26a.  The court acknowledged that \n\n12 \n \n\u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cperhaps the most impor-\ntant\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Id. at 17a.  And it \n\u201cagree[d] with the Government that the HHS Secretary \nmay remove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Id. at \n18a.  But the court noted that \u201canother important con-\nsideration  * * *  is the extent to which the Task Force\u2019s \nwork can be supervised by a higher-ranking executive \nofficial, like [the HHS] Secretary.\u201d  Id. at 20a.  \n\u201cOn that front,\u201d the court of appeals could not \u201csay \nthat any such supervision exists\u2014as a matter of law or \nreality.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  Citing Section 299b-4(a)(6), the \ncourt took the view that \u201cthe Task Force cannot be \u2018in-\ndependent\u2019 and free from \u2018political pressure\u2019 on the one \nhand, and at the same time be supervised by the HHS \nSecretary, a political appointee, on the other.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court construed \u201c\u200a\u2018independent\u2019\u200a\u201d in Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) to mean \u201cfree from any supervision,\u201d as opposed \nto simply \u201c\u200a\u2018unbiased.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 20a, 21a n.59.  And the \ncourt declined to read Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s phrase, \u201cto \nthe extent practicable,\u201d to give the Secretary a level of \ncontrol necessary to avoid any constitutional problem.  \n42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6); see Pet. App. 21a-23a.   \nThe court of appeals \u201cresolve[d] the competing  \nconsiderations\u201d bearing on the status of Task Force \nmembers\u2014at-will removability coupled with allegedly \nunreviewable authority\u2014\u201cin favor of holding that the \nTask Force members are principal officers.\u201d  Pet. App. \n24a.  The court considered it all but \u201cdispositive\u201d that, \n\u201c[l]ike the [Patent Trial and Appeal Board at issue in \nArthrex], the Task Force can, and does, issue legally bind-\ning decisions without any review by a higher-ranking of-\nficer.\u201d  Ibid.  The court considered inadequate the Sec-\nretary\u2019s \u201cindirect control over the Task Force\u2019s recom-\nmendations through his removal power.\u201d  Id. at 25a. \n\n13 \n \nThe court of appeals also declined to sever Section \n299b-4(a)(6) and allow the Secretary to review Task \nForce \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations on that basis.  Pet. \nApp. 30a-33a.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[i]f [it] \nwere to \u2018sever\u2019 \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6),\u201d the Secretary\u2019s review of \nTask Force recommendations \u201cwould not conflict with \nany other applicable statutory provision.\u201d  Id. at 31a.  \nBut the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d how a \u201cdecision \nto disregard \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) would also thereby empower \nthe Secretary to begin reviewing, and possibly reject-\ning, the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. (foot-\nnote omitted).  The court thus considered itself \u201cunable \nto track the Supreme Court\u2019s severability analysis in \nArthrex,\u201d and held that \u201cwith or without \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), \nthe constitutional problem persists.\u201d  Id. at 32a-33a.  \nb. The court of appeals next held that there \u201cwas no \nbasis\u201d for the district court\u2019s grant of \u201cuniversal reme-\ndies.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.  The court recognized \u201cnotable \nskepticism\u201d about the availability of universal vacatur \nunder the APA, but explained that its precedent \u201chas \nunderstood vacatur under \u00a7 706(2) to be a remedy that \naffects individuals beyond those who are parties to the \nimmediate dispute\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018default\u2019 remedy for un-\nlawful agency action.\u201d  Id. at 34a-36a.   \nThe court of appeals observed, however, that \u201cone of \nthe minimal requirements to be entitled to th[e] \u2018de-\nfault\u2019 APA remedy is, perhaps unsurprisingly, an APA \nclaim.\u201d  Pet. App. 37a.  Because respondents had failed \nto plead an APA claim, the court rejected the \u201cdistrict \ncourt\u2019s decision to vacate all agency actions taken to en-\nforce the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd \u201cwithout any basis to seek universal vacatur,\u201d the \ncourt held that respondents correspondingly \u201clack any \nbasis for an injunction of the same breadth.\u201d  Id. at 42a-\n43a.  The court thus limited the injunction to bar the \n\n14 \n \ngovernment from enforcing the preventive-services-\ncoverage requirements only against respondents.  Id. at \n43a.3   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nInferior officers are those \u201cwhose work is directed \nand supervised at some level by\u201d a principal officer.  Ed-\nmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997).  When \nclassifying an officer as inferior or principal, this Court \n\u201capprais[es]  * * *  how much power [that] officer exer-\ncises free from control by a superior.\u201d  United States v. \nArthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 17 (2021).  In general, an officer will \nbe inferior if he may be removed at will by, and have his \ndecisions reviewed by, a principal officer.   \nMembers of the Task Force fit that bill because they \ncannot make any legally binding final decisions on be-\nhalf of the United States without the Secretary\u2019s per-\nmission.  The Secretary can remove them at will, and \nthe threat of removal is the ultimate tool for control over \nfinal decisions on recommendations.  Moreover, the \nSecretary has separate statutory authorities that allow \nhim to determine whether Task Force recommenda-\ntions should become binding on health-insurance issu-\ners and group health plans and allow him to impose \nother controls.  Task Force members are therefore in-\nferior officers.  In holding otherwise, the court of ap-\npeals overlooked the extent of the Secretary\u2019s control.  \nAt a minimum, the cure for any Appointments Clause \nviolation would be to sever the statutory provision that \n \n3 The separate party-specific injunction arising from respondents\u2019 \nRFRA claims\u2014which bars the government from enforcing against \nrespondents the requirement to cover without cost sharing certain \nHIV-prevention medications\u2014remains in force and will not be af-\nfected by this Court\u2019s resolution of the Appointments Clause issue \nhere.  See p. 9, supra.  \n\n15 \n \nthe court (incorrectly) saw as unduly insulating the \nTask Force from secretarial supervision, not to bar the \nTask Force prospectively from exercising significant \ngovernment authority absent new legislation.  \nI. Task Force members are inferior officers, not \nprincipal officers. \nA. Only an officer properly appointed to a principal \noffice may have \u201cpower to render a final decision on be-\nhalf of the United States\u201d without possible supervision \nby a superior officer.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665.  A key \nquestion, then, is \u201chow much power\u201d an officer \u201cexer-\ncises free from control by a superior.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. \nat 17. \nWhile various tools may allow a principal officer to \ncontrol an inferior officer\u2019s decisions so that any final, \nbinding decision is the principal\u2019s own, two are particu-\nlarly significant.  First and foremost, the authority to \nremove an officer at will \u201ccarries with it the inherent \npower to direct and supervise.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 537 F.3d 667, 707 \n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting), aff\u200a\u2019d in \npart, rev\u2019d in part, and remanded, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  \nSecond, the authority to \u201creview\u201d an officer\u2019s decisions \nbefore they bind private parties ensures that the supe-\nrior officer is \u201cresponsib[le]\u201d for the decisions \u201cren-\ndered by\u201d the officers \u201cpurportedly under his charge.\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 14-15. \nB.  Here, the Secretary possesses both of those \nmeans of control over Task Force members.  They are \naccordingly inferior officers.   \nAs both lower courts recognized, the Secretary \u201cmay \nremove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. \n18a; see id. at 119a.  That at-will removal authority car-\nries with it the \u201cpower to direct and supervise.\u201d Free \nEnter. Fund, 537 F.3d at 707 (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\n\n16 \n \ning).  For instance, if the Task Force were to reject the \nSecretary\u2019s request to withdraw a particular recom-\nmendation, the Secretary could remove and replace the \nTask Force members.  Through his unfettered removal \npower, the Secretary can effectively ensure that no  \npreventive-services recommendations contrary to the \nSecretary\u2019s judgment will take binding effect.   \nIn addition, the Secretary may directly review\u2014and \ndeny legal force to\u2014Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations.  He may invoke his authority to \u201cestablish a min-\nimum interval\u201d before \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nbind insurance issuers and group health plans, to allow \ntime for him to conduct further review or request that \nthe Task Force reconsider or modify its recommenda-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1).  That power alone pre-\ncludes Task Force recommendations from having bind-\ning effect without the Secretary\u2019s approval.  And the Sec-\nretary may use his general rulemaking authority to fur-\nther enhance his supervisory role over recommendations \n\u2014for instance, by prescribing procedures by which Task \nForce recommendations shall be reviewed.  The combi-\nnation of the Secretary\u2019s authorities ensures more than \nadequate supervision over the Task Force.   \nC.  The contrary arguments offered by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and respondents lack merit.  The court of appeals \nmisinterpreted Section 299b-4(a)(6) as precluding the \nSecretary from reviewing, and denying binding effect \nto, Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  Section \n299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6).  That language requires that \nTask Force members make recommendations based on \ntheir impartial medical and public-health judgments.  It \ndoes not mean that the Secretary is barred from then \n\n17 \n \ndetermining whether Task Force recommendations will \nbe given legal effect.  That understanding follows natu-\nrally from the rest of the statutory framework, which \nprovides the Secretary substantial authority to oversee \nthe Public Health Service, including the Task Force.  \nAnd it tracks Congress\u2019s longstanding practice of au-\nthorizing inferior-officer adjudicators (such as adminis-\ntrative law judges) to make threshold decisions, while \nsubjecting those decisions to review by superior offic-\ners.   \nRespondents contend that to be constitutional, Sec-\ntion 299b-4(a)(6) must allow the Secretary not only to \nreview Task Force recommendations, but also to direct \nthe substance of those recommendations in the first in-\nstance.  This Court\u2019s precedent does not support that \ncontention.  In Edmond, for instance, the Court held \nthat judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Ap-\npeals were inferior officers where a principal officer \ncould \u201creview[]\u201d their decisions only ex post and could \n\u201cnot attempt to influence  * * *  the outcome of [their] \nindividual\u201d decisions ex ante.  520 U.S. at 664.  What \nmatters is that the Secretary, not the Task Force, is ul-\ntimately responsible for deciding what recommenda-\ntions will have final, binding legal effect.  Regardless, \nrespondents do not explain why the Secretary\u2019s plenary \nremoval authority would not confer additional control \nover recommendations, were such control constitution-\nally required.    \nII.  If the Court nevertheless holds that Task Force \nmembers are unconstitutionally insulated from secre-\ntarial supervision, Section 299b-4(a)(6) should be sev-\nered to cure that defect.  \nA.  This Court\u2019s ordinary practice \u201c\u200a\u2018when confront-\ning a constitutional flaw in a statute\u2019\u200a\u201d is to \u201csever[] any \n\u2018problematic portions while leaving the remainder in-\n\n18 \n \ntact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 508 (2010) (citation omit-\nted).  In Arthrex, for instance, the Court severed the \nstatutory provision that precluded principal-officer re-\nview of APJs\u2019 decisions, without disrupting the rest of \nthe statutory framework.  See 594 U.S. at 24-25.   \nHere, the court of appeals cited only one provision, \nSection 299b-4(a)(6), as unduly insulating Task Force \nrecommendations from secretarial review.  Under this \nCourt\u2019s precedent, the Fifth Circuit should have de-\nclared Section 299b-4(a)(6) unenforceable as applied  \nto Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  And it \nshould have left the statutory framework otherwise \u201cop-\nerative.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25. \nB.  The court of appeals declined to sever Section \n299b-4(a)(6) because it believed that doing so would not \n\u201calso thereby empower the Secretary to begin review-\ning, and possibly rejecting, the Task Force\u2019s recommen-\ndations.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a (footnote omitted).  But that \nview ignores the Secretary\u2019s broad supervisory powers \nover the Task Force, which would allow the Secretary \nto review Task Force recommendations\u2014and deny \nthem binding effect\u2014following the severance of Section \n299b-4(a)(6).  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 24-25.   \nRespondents contend that severing Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) would not cure the constitutional defect because \nthe Secretary would still lack power to review Task \nForce decisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndation.  But they cite no authority holding that the Ap-\npointments Clause requires principal-officer review of a \nsubordinate officer\u2019s inaction\u2014and this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Free Enterprise Fund indicates the opposite.  In \nany event, the Secretary here has multiple ways to en-\nsure that the Task Force will consider particular pro-\nposed recommendations.    \n\n19 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Task Force\u2019s structure comports with the Ap-\npointments Clause because Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers.  Task Force mem-\nbers cannot unilaterally render final decisions that have \nlegally binding effect.  Rather, Task Force recommen-\ndations have legal effect only if the Secretary allows \nthem to become final and binding.  Most pointedly, the \nSecretary can control whether Task Force recommen-\ndations take effect by removing Task Force members at \nwill.  The relevant statutory provisions separately ena-\nble the Secretary to review Task Force recommenda-\ntions and determine whether they will become legally \nbinding on insurance issuers and group health plans.  At \na minimum, if any Appointments Clause problem exists, \nthe court of appeals adopted the wrong solution.  The \ncourt should have severed the lone provision that it (in-\ncorrectly) perceived as unduly insulating the Task \nForce from secretarial control.  This Court should re-\nverse.  \nI. TASK FORCE MEMBERS ARE INFERIOR OFFICERS \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedent, Task Force members \nare the Secretary\u2019s subordinates, not principal officers \nin their own right.  The Secretary may remove Task \nForce members at will.  And he may deny binding effect \nto their preventive-services recommendations.  Task \nForce members are thus inferior officers who were val-\nidly appointed by the Secretary, and there is no Ap-\npointments Clause violation.  \n\n20 \n \nA. A Principal Officer\u2019s Power To Remove A Subordinate \nAt Will And To Review The Subordinate\u2019s Decisions \nProvides Constitutionally Adequate Supervision  \n1. \u201cGenerally speaking, the term \u2018inferior officer\u2019 \nconnotes a relationship with some higher ranking officer \nor officers below the President,\u201d because \u201c[w]hether one \nis an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a su-\nperior.\u201d  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 662 \n(1997).  Thus, inferior officers are ordinarily those \u201cwhose \nwork is directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663.  \nTo determine whether a particular officer qualifies \nas inferior, this Court \u201capprais[es]  * * *  how much \npower [that] officer exercises free from control by a su-\nperior.\u201d  United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 17 (2021).  \nSpecifically, the Court asks whether the relevant officer \nhas the statutory \u201cpower to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States\u201d without review \u201cby other \nExecutive officers.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665.  If so, \nthen the officer\u2019s \u201cunreviewable executive power\u201d would \nbe \u201cincompatible with the[] status [of\u200a] inferior officer[].\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 18.  \u201cOnly an officer properly ap-\npointed to a principal office may issue a final decision \nbinding the Executive Branch\u201d without possible super-\nvision by a superior officer.  Id. at 23. \nThe most potent tool by which principal officers can \nexert adequate \u201ccontrol\u201d over inferior officers is \u201c[t]he \npower to remove [an] officer[]\u201d at will.  Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 664.  After all, \u201c[o]nce an officer is appointed, it \nis only the authority that can remove him, and not the \nauthority that appointed him, that he must fear and, in \nthe performance of his functions, obey.\u201d  Bowsher v. \nSynar, 478 U.S. 714, 726 (1986) (citation omitted).  The \n\n21 \n \nofficer\u2019s \u201cpresumed desire to avoid removal\u201d therefore \n\u201ccreates [a] here-and-now subservience.\u201d  Id. at 727 n.5 \n(citation omitted).  As the D.C. Circuit has put the point, \n\u201c[w]ith unfettered removal power, [a principal officer] \nwill have the direct ability to \u2018direct,\u2019 \u2018supervise,\u2019 and \nexert some \u2018control\u2019 over [another officer\u2019s] decisions.\u201d  \nIntercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty \nBd., 684 F.3d 1332, 1341 (2012) (quoting Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 662-664), cert. denied, 569 U.S. 1004 (2013).4   \nAnother critical tool of control is the ability of a prin-\ncipal officer to \u201creview\u201d inferior officers\u2019 decisions be-\nfore they become final.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14.  Ordi-\nnarily, \u201cadequate supervision\u201d by a principal officer \n\u201centails review of decisions issued by inferior officers.\u201d  \nId. at 19.  That ensures that the principal officer is not \n\u201crelieve[d]  * * *  of responsibility for the final decisions \nrendered by\u201d the officers \u201cpurportedly under his charge.\u201d  \nId. at 15.   \n \n4 See also Free Enter.

This Court\u2019s recent Appointments Clause cases \nhave repeatedly rested their analysis on those two \nforms of principal-officer supervision:  at-will removal, \nand review of inferior-officer decisions.  In Edmond, the \nCourt held that judges of the Coast Guard Court of \nCriminal Appeals properly serve as inferior officers.  \n520 U.S. at 666.  In so holding, the Court emphasized \nthat the Judge Advocate General may remove those \njudges \u201cfrom [their] judicial assignment without cause,\u201d \nand that their decisions could be \u201creverse[d]\u201d by \u201can-\nother Executive Branch entity, the Court of Appeals for \nthe Armed Forces.\u201d  Id. at 664. \nSimilarly, in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Ac-\ncounting Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), this Court \u201cha[d] \nno hesitation in concluding\u201d that members of the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board were inferior of-\nficers once \u201cthe statutory restrictions on the [Securities \nand Exchange] Commission\u2019s power to remove Board \nmembers\u201d had been severed from the statute.  Id. at 510.  \nIn addition to the Commission\u2019s at-will removal power, \nthe Court stressed the \u201cCommission\u2019s other oversight\u201d \nmechanisms, including its abilities to \u201crelieve the Board \nof authority\u201d and to \u201camend Board sanctions.\u201d  Id. at \n504, 510.   \nMost recently, in Arthrex, the Court concluded that \nAPJs could not be deemed inferior officers because they \n\u201chave the \u2018power to render a final decision on behalf of \nthe United States\u2019 without  * * *  review by their nomi-\nnal superior or any other principal officer in the Execu-\ntive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 14 (citation omitted).  The \nCourt distinguished Edmond on the ground that \u201c[w]hat \nwas \u2018significant\u2019 to the outcome there\u2014review by a su-\nperior executive officer\u2014[was] absent\u201d in the statutory \nframework governing APJs.  Ibid. \n\n23 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit and respondents give insuffi-\ncient weight to at-will removal authority.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cthe \nmost important\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  Respondents have likewise conceded that \u201c[a]t-will \nremoval is the sine qua non of a dependent relation-\nship.\u201d  Resp. C.A. Br. 9.  And the court further \u201cagree[d] \nwith the Government that the HHS Secretary may re-\nmove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. \n18a.  Yet despite the \u201chere-and-now subservience\u201d cre-\nated by at-will removability, Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 727 \nn.5 (citation omitted), the court determined that Task \nForce members are principal officers by reasoning that \nat-will removability by a superior cannot alone suffice \nto make someone an inferior officer.  Pet. App. 19a.   \nThis Court need not resolve that question, because \nthe Secretary has other means of control besides at-will \nremoval.  Regardless, the court of appeals did not iden-\ntify any instance in which at-will removability was held \nto be constitutionally insufficient to render an officer  \ninferior.  And neither the court nor respondents have \nidentified any examples, either in statute or judicial \nprecedent, of officials who were removable at will by \nsomeone other than the President and yet were them-\nselves principal officers required to be appointed by the \nPresident with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.   \nBy contrast, there are countless examples \u201cwhere \nCongress historically has provided for appointment of \nan executive officer by the Head of a Department\u201d and \nmade \u201cclear that the officer was inferior to that princi-\npal officer\u2014because Congress did not prevent the prin-\ncipal officer from removing that inferior officer at will.\u201d  \nFree Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight \nBd., 537 F.3d 667, 705 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting), aff\u200a\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, and remanded, \n\n24 \n \n561 U.S. 477 (2010).  For instance, in 1789, the First \nCongress expressly designated \u201cthe Secretary for the \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs\u201d as \u201ca principal officer,\u201d \nwhile deeming his subordinate, the \u201cchief Clerk,\u201d \u201can \ninferior officer\u201d who was \u201cto be appointed by the said \nprincipal officer\u201d and \u201cto be employed  * * *  as [the Sec-\nretary] shall deem proper.\u201d  Act of July 27, 1789, ch. 4, \n\u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 1 Stat. 28-29; see Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 7, \u00a7 2,  \n1 Stat. 50 (same for the Chief Clerk of the Department \nof War).5  This Court later held that in those \u201cdepart-\nments\u201d in which \u201cpower is given to the secretary[] to \nappoint all necessary clerks,\u201d \u201cthere can be no doubt[] \nthat these clerks hold their office at the will and discre-\ntion of the head of the department.\u201d  In re Hennen, 38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) 230, 259-260 (1839).  That history shows \nthat at-will removal was a key hallmark of inferior- \nofficer status, in keeping with the background constitu-\ntional requirement that those who exercise executive \npower on the President\u2019s behalf must be fully accounta-\nble to the President.   \nMore recently, too, Congress has established im-\nportant federal offices with substantial discretion and \nauthority that have been understood to be inferior of-\nfices in significant part because their occupants may be \nremoved at will by a principal officer.  For example, the \nFederal Open Market Committee within the Federal \nReserve System has final authority over the System\u2019s \n\u201c[o]pen market operations\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe purchase and \n \n5 See also Act of Sept. 2, 1789, ch. 12, \u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 65 (Assistant to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury appointed by and removable at will \nby Secretary of the Treasury); Act of Feb. 20, 1792, ch. 7, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. \n234 (Deputy Postmasters appointed by and removable at will by \nPostmaster General); Act of Apr. 30, 1798, ch. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 1 Stat. 553-\n554 (Principal Clerk of Navy appointed by and removable at will by \nSecretary of Navy). \n\n25 \n \nsale of Government securities in the domestic securities \nmarket,\u201d through which the System expands or con-\ntracts the supply of money in the United States.

None-\ntheless, certain members of the committee are merely \ninferior officers because they sit alongside members of \nthe Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who lack the \npower to countermand individual committee decisions, \nsee 12 U.S.C. 263(b), but have \u201cthe authority to remove \n[the other committee members] at will.\u201d  Appointment \nand Removal of Federal Reserve Bank Members of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, 43 Op.

Not only may the Secretary \nsupervise Task Force members through his power to \nremove them at will, but he may also directly review\u2014\nand deny binding effect to\u2014their preventive-services \nrecommendations.   \n1. The Secretary may supervise Task Force members \nthrough his at-will removal authority \nAs both the court of appeals and district court recog-\nnized, \u201cthe HHS Secretary may remove members of the \nTask Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a; see id. at 119a.  That \nconclusion follows from the Secretary\u2019s authority to ap-\npoint Task Force members when \u201cacting through the \nDirector\u201d of AHRQ, 42 U.S.C. 299(a), who normally con-\nvenes the Task Force, 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).

In turn, \u201cthe power of \nremoval of executive officers [i]s incident to the power \nof appointment.\u201d  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n119 (1926); see Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509.   \nThe Secretary\u2019s authority to remove Task Force \nmembers is unfettered.  \u201cWhen a statute does not limit \nthe President\u2019s power to remove an agency head, [the \nCourt] generally presume[s] that the officer serves at \nthe President\u2019s pleasure.\u201d  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 248 (2021).  Similarly, when a statute empowers an \nagency head to appoint an inferior officer and imposes \nno limitations on removal, \u201cthere can be no doubt\u201d that \nthe inferior officer \u201chold[s] [his] office at the will and \n\n27 \n \ndiscretion of the head of the department,\u201d even if \u201cno \npower to remove is expressly given.\u201d  Hennen, 38 U.S. \n(13 Pet.) at 259-260; see, e.g., Reagan v. United States, \n182 U.S. 419, 424, 426-427 (1901).   \nHere, no statutory text protects Task Force mem-\nbers from at-will removal by the Secretary.  That stat-\nutory silence establishes that Task Force members \nserve at the Secretary\u2019s pleasure.  The structure of the \nTask Force is consistent with the \u201chistorical[]\u201d model \nfor inferior officers.  Free Enter. Fund, 537 F.3d at 705 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  Congress has allowed a \nmeans for appointment of Task Force members by a \nSenate-confirmed \u201cHead of a Department\u201d\u2014here, the \nSecretary\u2014and \u201cdid not prevent\u201d the Secretary \u201cfrom \nremoving\u201d Task Force members \u201cat will.\u201d  Ibid.  As a \nresult, it should be \u201cclear\u201d that Task Force members \nare subordinate to the Secretary.  Ibid. \nThe Secretary\u2019s ability to remove Task Force mem-\nbers at will ensures that they cannot exercise significant \npower \u201cfree from control by a superior,\u201d let alone issue \nbinding recommendations or make other decisions with-\nout the Secretary\u2019s review.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 17.   \nFor instance, the Secretary could suggest that the  \nTask Force consider a particular topic for a preventive- \nservices recommendation and remove Task Force mem-\nbers if they declined to take up his proposal.  See D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 77 (explaining that \u201canyone can nominate  \n* * *  new topics for the Task Force to consider\u201d).  The \nSecretary could request or direct the Task Force not to \npublish an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation that he does not \nsupport.  And the Secretary could request the Task \nForce to reconsider a recommendation he believed to be \nunsound.  Ultimately, if he found it appropriate, he could \nremove and replace Task Force members and request \nthat the reconstituted Task Force modify or rescind a \n\n28 \n \nrecommendation before he sets an effective date for \nthat recommendation.   \n2. The Secretary may also deny binding effect to the \nTask Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nIn addition to removing Task Force members at will, \nthe Secretary may supervise and review their recom-\nmendations directly.   \nAs an initial matter, the Secretary can exercise con-\ntrol over Task Force recommendations through his au-\nthority to \u201cestablish a minimum interval\u201d before \u201cA\u201d \nand \u201cB\u201d recommendations become \u201ceffective.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(b)(1).  In other words, the Secretary controls \nwhether and when recommendations have binding legal \neffect.  Even if the Secretary has established a general \nminimum interval, he could set a longer interval for a \nrecommendation about which he has concerns and re-\nquest that the Task Force study that recommendation \nfurther (perhaps through additional public and profes-\nsional input), consider modifying it, or direct others in \nthe Public Health Service to evaluate it.  In the mean-\ntime, insurance issuers and group health plans would \nhave no binding obligation to cover the recommended \nservice without cost sharing.   \nBeyond the Secretary\u2019s authority to establish when \nrecommendations become binding, Congress has broadly \nempowered the Secretary to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, which includes \nthe Task Force.  The Secretary also may perform \u201call \nfunctions of the Public Health Service\u201d and its \u201coffic-\ners,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d and \u201cmake such pro-\nvisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the \nperformance of any of the functions  * * *  of the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d  Reorganization Plan \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 \nStat. 1610. \n\n29 \n \nThose authorities would furnish the Secretary with \nadditional means to review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \n\u201cB\u201d recommendations and determine whether they \nshould become legally binding on issuers and plans.  If \nthe Secretary \u201cdirect[s]\u201d that a recommendation should \nnot be given binding effect, 42 U.S.C. 202, then issuers \nand plans would not be required to cover it without cost \nsharing.  See 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1) (requiring cover-\nage only of \u201citems or services that have in effect a rating \nof \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of the\u201d \nTask Force) (emphasis added). \nFinally, the Secretary may use his general regula-\ntory authority to ensure additional supervision over \nTask Force recommendations.  See 42 U.S.C. 202; 42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-92; Reorganization Plan \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. \n1610.  He could, for example, prescribe procedures for \nthe Task Force\u2019s consideration of recommendations \nabout certain services, or provide that the Task Force \nbe required to consider proposals that he submits him-\nself or through the components in the Public Health \nService.  And he could provide for a preclearance re-\ngime under which the Task Force must notify the Sec-\nretary before it votes on a final \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndation, and no such recommendations would take bind-\ning effect absent his affirmative approval, had other \nmeasures not proved sufficient to accomplish that.   \n3. The Secretary\u2019s combined authorities provide more \nthan enough supervision over the Task Force \nAs just explained, the Secretary possesses both \nforms of supervisory authority that this Court has \ndeemed critical: the power to remove Task Force mem-\nbers at will and the power to review their recommenda-\ntions before they bind private parties.  This case thus \nfalls neatly within Edmond.  There, as here, judges on \n\n30 \n \nthe Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals could be re-\nmoved by a principal officer from assignments \u201cwithout \ncause,\u201d and a higher appellate court could \u201creverse\u201d their \n\u201cdecisions.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  Just as those \njudges were inferior officers, so are Task Force mem-\nbers.   \nArthrex confirms that conclusion.  There, after find-\ning the statutory framework unconstitutional, the Court \ncured the violation by severing only the provision that \n\u201cprevent[ed] the [principal officer] from reviewing final \ndecisions\u201d of APJs.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  The Court \nleft intact the provision that insulated APJs from re-\nmoval by the agency head only \u201cfor such cause as will \npromote the efficiency of the service.\u201d  Id. at 26 (quoting \n5 U.S.C. 7513(a)); see ibid. (declining to adopt the court \nof appeals\u2019 approach of severing \u201cthe for-cause provi-\nsion\u201d).  Here, the statute allows both principal-officer \nreview and at-will removability, so Task Force mem-\nbers are plainly inferior officers. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Advanced By The Court Of Ap-\npeals And Respondents Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals nonetheless held that \u201cTask \nForce members are principal officers.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  \nIn so holding, the court misconstrued Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) as precluding secretarial review of Task Force \nrecommendations.  And respondents err in contending \nthat the Appointments Clause requires that the Secre-\ntary have power not only to review Task Force recom-\nmendations, but also to direct those recommendations \nin the first instance.   \n\n31 \n \n1. The court of appeals erroneously concluded that  \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) precludes the Secretary from re-\nviewing Task Force recommendations \nThe court of appeals concluded that, even though \n\u201cTask Force members are subject to at-will removal by \nthe HHS Secretary,\u201d they are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d be-\ncause (in the court\u2019s view) their \u201c\u200a\u2018recommendations\u2019  \non legally mandated coverage of preventive care go  \nunreviewed\u2014and are unreviewable\u2014by a higher-rank-\ning officer.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  As explained above, see pp. \n28-29, supra, that conclusion misinterprets the relevant \nstatutory provisions as precluding secretarial review of \nTask Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  While the \ncourt briefly acknowledged the Secretary\u2019s background \npowers over the Public Health Service, it believed they \ncould not \u201coverride\u201d Section 299b-4(a)(6), Pet. App. 30a, \nwhich provides that Task Force members and their rec-\nommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6).  The court read the term \u201cindependent\u201d in \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) to mean \u201cdecisionmaking without \nsupervision\u201d and \u201ccomplete autonomy.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a, \n21a n.59.   \na. That reading is incorrect.  Nothing in Section \n299b-4(a)(6) bars the Secretary from reviewing, and de-\nciding whether to deny binding effect to, Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations\u2014and a contrary reading \nwould raise unnecessary constitutional concerns.  Most \nnaturally understood, Section 299b-4(a)(6) does not ad-\ndress the relationship of the Task Force to HHS at all.  \nRather, by requiring that Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations be \u201cindependent and, to the ex-\ntent practicable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6), Section 299b-4(a)(6) clarifies that \n\n32 \n \nthe members must exercise their own best medical and \npublic-health judgments, must not regard themselves \nas mere representatives of the organizations or profes-\nsions in which they serve, and must not be influenced by \noutside pressures.  See also 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1) (re-\nquiring that recommendations be based on relevant \n\u201cscientific evidence\u201d).   \nBut even if Section 299b-4(a)(6) is also understood as \naddressing the relationship of the Task Force to HHS, \nit still does not support the court of appeals\u2019 holding \nhere.  The statutory requirements of \u201cindependen[ce]\u201d \nand freedom from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d do not preclude \nthe Secretary from denying binding effect to Task \nForce \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  42 U.S.C. 299b-\n4(a)(6).  Contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning, the \nmore natural reading of \u201cindependent\u201d is \u201cbeing or act-\ning free of the influence of something else,\u201d \u201cnot looking \nto others for one\u2019s opinions,\u201d and \u201cacting or thinking \nfreely.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary \nof the English Language 1148 (1993) (emphasis added); \nsee The American Heritage Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 917 (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cFree from the influence\u201d \nor \u201cguidance\u201d of others).   \nThus, although the statutory requirement of inde-\npendence might be read as suggesting that Task Force \nmembers\u2019 recommendations must be unreviewable, it is \nbetter read as meaning only that Task Force members\u2019 \nconsideration of proposed recommendations must be \nguided by the members\u2019 expert and impartial judgment.  \nAfter all, the text first provides that the members shall \nbe independent, which focuses on the individual mem-\nbers\u2019 participation on the Task Force.  And the Task \nForce then produces recommendations, which will by \ndefinition have operative effect only if they are adopted \nby someone else.  Under the latter of the two meanings \n\n33 \n \nidentified above, then, the Secretary may still review \nTask Force recommendations, even though the Task \nForce members initially formed them impartially.   \nb. Statutory context further supports the govern-\nment\u2019s reading.  See Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) (\u201c[T]he Court \nmust read the words Congress enacted \u2018in their context \nand with a view to their place in the overall statutory \nscheme.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation omitted).  The relevant statutory \nprovisions afford the Secretary broad supervisory pow-\ners over the Task Force and allow him to remove Task \nForce members for any reason\u2014including because they \nrefused to consider a recommendation the Secretary \nproposed or issued one that the Secretary found un-\nsound.  Given those means of secretarial control, it would \nbe incongruous to interpret Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s ref-\nerence to independence as \u201ca clear and express direc-\ntive from Congress that the Task Force be free from \nany supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a (emphasis added).   \nCongress\u2019s longstanding practice of vesting inde-\npendent decision-making authority in inferior-officer \nadjudicators further confirms that independence in \nforming initial decisions can be compatible with inferior-\nofficer status.  As the Court observed in Arthrex, while \n\u201cinferior adjudicative officers\u201d are expected to issue in-\ndependent decisions, \u201cit \u2018certainly is the norm\u2019 for prin-\ncipal officers to have the capacity to review [those] de-\ncisions.\u201d  594 U.S. at 20 (citation omitted); see id. at 25 \n(referring to that approach as \u201cthe almost-universal \nmodel of adjudication in the Executive Branch\u201d); Lucia \nv. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 242 (2018) (explaining that the Se-\ncurities and Exchange Commission may \u201creview the \n[Administrative Law Judge\u2019s] decision\u201d).  Administra-\ntive law judges are therefore properly regarded as infe-\nrior officers, because principal officers retain other  \n\n34 \n \ncontrols\u2014including the power to determine what deci-\nsions become final and binding.  Bandimere v. SEC, 844 \nF.3d 1168, 1179 (10th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 585 U.S. \n1035 (2018); see also 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(d)(7)(i) and (h) (al-\nlowing the Attorney General to review decisions of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals).  \nLikewise, the \u201cspecial trial judges\u201d of the Tax Court \nat issue in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), \n\u201cexercise significant discretion\u201d and \u201cindependent au-\nthority\u201d when adjudicating certain proceedings, id. at \n882.  But they do so only \u201csubject to such conditions and \nreview as the [Tax Court] may provide.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n7443A(c); see Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 20.  Accordingly, this \nCourt held that the special trial judges are inferior of-\nficers.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 882. \nThus, under the Appointments Clause, Congress \nmay permissibly provide for an initial \u201cimpartial deci-\nsion by a panel of experts,\u201d followed by a final \u201ctrans-\nparent decision for which a politically accountable of-\nficer must take responsibility.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 16.  \nAnd, again, at-will removal provides yet further control \nover the Task Force.   \nc. The court of appeals emphasized Congress\u2019s in-\nstruction that Task Force members and their recom-\nmendations not be \u201csubject to political pressure,\u201d \u201cto \nthe extent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6); see Pet. \nApp. 20a.  According to the court, if the Secretary may \ndeny binding effect to Task Force members\u2019 recommen-\ndations, \u201cthen the Task Force would have no political \nindependence at all, contrary to the terms of the provi-\nsion.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that the Secretary has unfettered, at-will re-\nmoval authority over the Task Force.  Such authority \nincludes the power to remove Task Force members if \nthey refuse to withdraw proposed recommendations\u2014\n\n35 \n \nthus preventing recommendations from taking effect\u2014\nand it is difficult to see why Section 299b-4(a)(6) would \ncabin other secretarial powers but not the most potent \npower of removal.  Moreover, as just explained, Con-\ngress has directed several categories of inferior officers \nto make decisions using independent judgment, while at \nthe same time subjecting those decisions to review by \npresidentially appointed principal officers.   \nIn any event, Section 299b-4(a)(6) explicitly qualifies \nthe requirement of freedom from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d \nwith the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6).  If greater secretarial supervision over \nTask Force recommendations is constitutionally neces-\nsary, then the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d can be \nreadily interpreted to allow it.  This Court will construe \na statute to \u201cavoid\u201d a substantial question whether the \nstatute is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d if \u201cthere is another reason-\nable interpretation available.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at \n658.  Here, Congress plainly intended to allow a saving \nconstruction, if necessary, by qualifying the limitation \non political pressure with the flexible phrase \u201cto the ex-\ntent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals declined to adopt that construc-\ntion because the court thought it would raise a \u201cline-\ndrawing problem\u201d when determining which Task Force \n\u201crecommendations\u201d would be subject to secretarial re-\nview.  Pet. App. 22a.  But there is no mystery about \nwhere to draw the line.  Any additional constitutionally \nnecessary review will apply only to the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations because they are the only ones that can \nhave binding effects on private parties.  See 42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1).  Accordingly, only those recommenda-\ntions involve the exercise of \u201csignificant authority pur-\nsuant to the laws of the United States\u201d that makes Task \nForce members federal officers in the first place.  Ar-\n\n36 \n \nthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1, 126 (1976) (per curiam)).  The Task Force\u2019s nonbind-\ning recommendations (such as its \u201cC\u201d recommenda-\ntions) would require no additional secretarial supervi-\nsion, because they involve no significant exercise of fed-\neral power.  See id. at 14 (evaluating supervision only of \nthe powers \u201cthat make[] the APJs officers exercising \n\u2018significant authority\u2019 in the first place\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nThe court of appeals also suggested that the govern-\nment\u2019s reading of Section 299b-4(a)(6) is \u201cinconsistent,\u201d \nPet. App. 23a, with Section 300gg-13(b)(1)\u2019s require-\nment that the Secretary \u201cestablish a minimum interval \nbetween the date on which\u201d the Task Force assigns an \n\u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating to a preventive service and the date \non which issuers and plans must cover that service with-\nout cost sharing, 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1).  That provi-\nsion serves in part to give issuers and plans time to in-\ncorporate preventive services for the next policy or plan \nyear.  But the Secretary\u2019s authority to establish such an \ninterval for that purpose does not deny the Secretary \nthe ability to invoke that authority for the additional \npurpose of allowing him time to review\u2014and then deny \nbinding effect to\u2014recommendations, or to remove and \nreplace the Task Force members who issued them. \n2. Respondents erroneously contend that the Appoint-\nments Clause requires that the Secretary have power \nto direct recommendations \nRespondents contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 30-31) \nthat to be constitutional, Section 299b-4(a)(6) must al-\nlow the Secretary not only to review Task Force recom-\nmendations, but also to direct the substance of those \nrecommendations in the first instance.  Notably, the \nFifth Circuit did not endorse that argument.  Instead, \n\n37 \n \nit suggested that if the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations were \u201c[]reviewable\u201d by the Secretary, \nthen Task Force members would be inferior officers.  \nPet. App. 24a.  The court simply believed\u2014incorrectly\n\u2014that Section 299b-4(a)(6) precludes such review. \nRespondents err in contending that secretarial power \nto direct recommendations is also constitutionally re-\nquired.  So long as the Secretary may determine wheth-\ner recommendations bind private parties, he bears \u201cre-\nsponsibility for the final decisions rendered\u201d by the \nTask Force members \u201cunder his charge.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 \nU.S. at 15.  In turn, the President can \u201cattribute\u201d the \nTask Force\u2019s decisions to a principal officer \u201cwhom he \ncan oversee.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 496 (em-\nphasis omitted).  And the public is not left to \u201cwonder \n\u2018on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious \nmeasure, or series of pernicious measures ought really \nto fall.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 16 (quoting The Federalist \nNo. 70, at 476 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke \ned., 1961)).  The Secretary can control Task Force rec-\nommendations by removing or threatening to remove \nTask Force members at will, by preventing recommen-\ndations from having final, binding effect, and by pre-\nscribing procedures to govern the recommendations \nprocess, among other means.  The Appointments Clause \ndoes not require more.   \nIn Edmond, for example, this Court held that judges \nof the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals were in-\nferior officers even though no superior could \u201cattempt \nto influence (by threat of removal or otherwise) the out-\ncome of individual proceedings.\u201d  520 U.S. at 664.  The \nCourt explained that \u201c[w]hat [wa]s significant\u201d was that \nthe judges had \u201cno power to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States unless permitted to do so \nby\u201d a superior officer.  Id. at 665 (emphasis added).  And \n\n38 \n \nthe Court emphasized that even though a principal of-\nficer could not direct the judges\u2019 decisions ex ante, an \n\u201cExecutive Branch entity\u201d could \u201creverse [those] deci-\nsions\u201d after the fact.  Id. at 664.  Under Edmond, it is \nsignificant that a principal officer may review\u2014and \nthen decide to deny binding effect to\u2014an inferior of-\nficer\u2019s decision.  The principal officer need not also have \nthe power to direct the inferior officer\u2019s decision in the \nfirst place.  \nThat principle traces back to this Court\u2019s decision in \nMyers.  There, in discussing the President\u2019s removal \npower, the Court explained that \u201cthere may be duties of \na quasi-judicial character imposed on executive officers \nand members of executive tribunals  * * *  the discharge \nof which the President can not in a particular case \nproperly influence or control.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 135.  \nBut the Court saw no constitutional problem with that \nstructure because the President \u201cmay consider the de-\ncision after its rendition as a reason for removing the \nofficer, on the ground that the discretion regularly en-\ntrusted to that officer by statute has not been on the \nwhole intelligently or wisely exercised.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nsame logic applies here:  Even if the Secretary could not \n\u201cinfluence or control\u201d Task Force recommendations ex \nante, but see p. 27, supra, he may review those decisions \nafter they are issued, deny them binding effect, and con-\nsider them \u201cas a reason for removing\u201d Task Force mem-\nbers, Myers, 272 U.S. at 135.   \nII. ANY APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE VIOLATION MAY BE \nCURED BY SEVERING SECTION 299b-4(a)(6) \nEven if this Court were to conclude that the Task \nForce is unduly insulated from secretarial supervision, \nthe proper course would be to sever the provision cre-\nating such insulation.  The court of appeals erred in de-\n\n39 \n \nclining to do so and instead prospectively barred the \nTask Force from issuing \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nthat may create binding coverage obligations\u2014at least \nabsent new legislation.   \nA. Severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) Would Eliminate The \nOnly Constitutional Flaw The Fifth Circuit Identified \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Generally speaking, when confronting a constitu-\ntional flaw in a statute, [the Court] tr[ies] to limit the \nsolution to the problem,\u2019 severing any \u2018problematic por-\ntions while leaving the remainder intact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 508 (citation omitted).  That approach \nstems from the Judiciary\u2019s \u201cnegative power to disregard \nan unconstitutional enactment\u201d in resolving a legal dis-\npute.  Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923).  \nAnd \u201c[b]ecause \u2018the unconstitutionality of a part of an \nAct does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of \nits remaining provisions,\u2019 the \u2018normal rule\u2019 is \u2018that par-\ntial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required \ncourse.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 508 (citations \nand brackets omitted).  Indeed, it has been \u201cfirmly es-\ntablished since Marbury v. Madison\u201d that \u201ceven in the \nabsence of a severability clause\u201d courts should opt \u201cfor \nsurgical severance rather than wholesale destruction\u201d \nwhen they find constitutional flaws in Congress\u2019s work.  \nBarr v. American Ass\u2019n of Political Consultants, Inc., \n591 U.S. 610, 626 (2020) (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).   \nThus, in Arthrex, this Court deemed the constitu-\ntional problem to be that the \u201cunreviewable authority\u201d \nof APJs was \u201cincompatible with their appointment by \nthe Secretary [of Commerce] to an inferior office.\u201d  594 \nU.S. at 23.  The Court fixed that problem by determin-\ning that the statute \u201ccannot constitutionally be enforced \nto the extent that its requirements prevent the [Patent \nand Trademark Office] Director from reviewing final \n\n40 \n \ndecisions rendered by APJs.\u201d  Id. at 25.7  The Court \ntherefore \u201csever[ed]\u201d the provision \u201cshielding\u201d the \nAPJs\u2019 decisions \u201cfrom review\u201d by the Director.  Id. at \n24.  Without that provision, the Court reasoned, \u201cthe Di-\nrector has the authority to provide for a means of re-\nviewing\u201d the relevant decisions \u201c[b]ecause Congress \nhas vested the Director with the \u2018power and duties\u2019 of \nthe [Patent and Trademark Office].\u201d  Id. at 25 (citation \nomitted).  Accordingly, the Court held that, following \nseverance, the Director \u201cmay review\u201d APJs\u2019 decisions \nand that the statute \u201cotherwise remains operative.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThe same logic applies here.  The court of appeals \nidentified the constitutional defect as the absence of a \n\u201csupervisory role for the Secretary\u201d over \u201cthe Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  And the court \npinpointed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s requirement that rec-\nommendations \u201cbe \u2018independent\u2019 and free from \u2018political \npressure\u2019\u200a\u201d as the source of that defect.  Id. at 20a; see \nid. at 23a.  The fix therefore should have been to sever \nSection 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \n\u201cB\u201d recommendations, thus giving the Secretary \u201cau-\nthority to provide for a means of reviewing\u201d those rec-\nommendations.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  And the court \nshould have left the statutory scheme otherwise \u201coper-\native,\u201d ibid.\u2014particularly because it is not \u201c\u200a\u2018evident\u2019\u200a\u201d \nthat if Congress had been \u201cfaced with the limitations \nimposed by the Constitution,\u201d it \u201cwould have preferred\u201d \n \n7 The severability portion of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion was joined \nby Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 4.  \nJustice Breyer issued an opinion concurring in part and dissenting \nin part, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, which \u201cagree[d] \nwith [the] remedial holding\u201d of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion.  Id. at 44.  \nThus, seven Members of the Court concurred in the severability \nanalysis.   \n\n41 \n \na Task Force without any authority to issue preventive-\nservices recommendations that may bind issuers and \nplans over a Task Force whose recommendations are \nreviewed by the Secretary before they become binding, \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509 (citation omitted).   \nB. The Severability Analysis Offered By The Court Of Ap-\npeals And Respondents Is Flawed \n1. The court of appeals \u201cagree[d] with the Govern-\nment\u201d that severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) would ensure \nsecretarial supervision of the Task Force.  Pet. App. \n31a.  But the court found that a \u201cdecision to disregard \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d would not \u201calso thereby empower the Sec-\nretary to begin reviewing, and possibly rejecting, the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid.  (footnote omit-\nted).  Although the court recognized that \u201c[s]uch secre-\ntarial review would not conflict with any other applica-\nble statutory provision,\u201d the court saw no affirmative \n\u201cpower to review the recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. \nThat reasoning conflicts with Arthrex.  As noted, the \nCourt there held that after severing the offending pro-\nvision, the Patent and Trademark Office Director \u201cha[d] \nthe authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u201d the \nrelevant APJ decisions.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  In so \nholding, the Court relied on a general provision \u201cvest[ing] \nthe Director with the \u2018powers and duties\u2019 of the [Patent \nand Trademark Office]\u201d and emphasized that \u201c[a] single \nofficer has\u201d long \u201csuperintended the activities of\u200a\u201d that \noffice.  Id. at 24 (citation omitted).  Likewise here, the \nSecretary has the power to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, as well as the \npower to perform \u201call functions of the Public Health \nService\u201d and its \u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d Reorganiza-\ntion Plan \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610.  And the Secretary has \nsuperintended the Public Health Service\u2019s activities \n\n42 \n \nsince the Reorganization Plan was promulgated in 1966.  \nSee 80 Stat. 1610.  Under Arthrex, the Secretary\u2019s long-\nstanding background authority to supervise and per-\nform the Public Health Service\u2019s functions would com-\nfortably provide for secretarial review of Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations following the severance \nof Section 299b-4(a)(6).   \nThe court of appeals reasoned that it could not \n\u201ctrack\u201d the \u201cseverability analysis in Arthrex\u201d because, \nin the court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]here are no fallback provisions \non which [the Secretary] can rely to exercise a supervi-\nsory power.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a.  But Section 202 expressly \nempowers the Secretary to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service.  42 U.S.C. 202.  It is therefore \nprecisely the type of \u201cfallback provision[]\u201d that the \ncourt of appeals recognized would be sufficient to per-\nmit principal-officer review.  Pet. App. 32a.   \nThe court of appeals focused instead on the Reorgan-\nization Plan\u2014but it misunderstood that plan\u2019s opera-\ntion.  See Pet. App. 31a-32a.  The Reorganization Plan \nallows the Secretary to exercise power over \u201call func-\ntions of the Public Health Service,\u201d though it creates an \nexception for \u201cthe functions vested by law in any advi-\nsory council, board, or committee of or in the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d  \u00a7 1, 80 Stat. 1610.  The court believed \nthat the exception applies to the Task Force and that \nthe Secretary therefore lacks power over the Task \nForce.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.   \nBut that exception does not apply to the Task Force.  \nInstead, it applies to federal advisory committees or \ncouncils that have purely recommendatory duties, like \nthe Surgeon General\u2019s advisory committee that issued a \nlandmark report on the health effects of smoking just \ntwo years before the Reorganization Plan\u2019s adoption.  \nSee Pub. Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health, Educ., & \n\n43 \n \nWelfare, Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory \nCommittee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health \nService (1964), https://perma.cc/8YPT-M9MB.  Indeed, \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), Pub. L. \nNo. 92-463, 86 Stat. 770 (1972), enacted shortly after the \nReorganization Plan, uses similar terminology, refer-\nring to \u201ccommittees, boards, commissions, councils, and \nsimilar groups which have been established to advise of-\nficers and agencies in the executive branch\u201d and whose \nfunction is \u201cadvisory only.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a7 2(a) and (b)(6), 86 Stat. \n770; see 5 U.S.C. 1002(a) and (b)(6) (Supp. IV 2022).   \nThe Task Force is not an advisory body covered by \nthe Reorganization Plan\u2019s exception.  Congress has ex-\npressly provided that \u201cthe Task Force is not subject to \n[FACA].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(5) (Supp. IV 2022).  And \nthe Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations are not \nadvisory, since the ACA made them binding on private \ninsurance issuers and group health plans.  42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1).  The court of appeals offered no reason \nwhy Congress would create a body that HHS\u2014through \nAHRQ\u2014convenes, provide for its decisions to bind the \npublic, and yet choose not to allow the Secretary to \noversee that body despite vesting the Secretary with all \nother authority in the Public Health Service.  The more \nnatural reading is that Congress authorized the Secre-\ntary to oversee the Task Force, just as the Secretary \noversees all the components of the Public Health Ser-\nvice that perform significant federal functions.   \n2. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the Reorganization Plan\u2019s exception.  In-\nstead, they contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 33) that sev-\nering Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not cure the constitu-\ntional defect because the Secretary would still lack the \n\u201cability to review or countermand [the Task Force\u2019s] de-\ncisions not to adopt an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 recommendation.\u201d  But \n\n44 \n \nrespondents offer no authority for the proposition that \nprincipal-officer review over a subordinate\u2019s inaction is \nnecessary to satisfy the Appointments Clause.  In Free \nEnterprise Fund, for instance, it was enough that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission could remove \nmembers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard \u201cat will\u201d and exercise \u201cother oversight author-\nity.\u201d  561 U.S. at 510.  The Court did not suggest that \nthe Commission must also have power to review Board \ndecisions not to conduct investigations or bring enforce-\nment actions; in fact, the Court acknowledged that the \nrelevant statute \u201cnowhere g[ave] the Commission effec-\ntive power to start, stop, or alter individual Board in-\nvestigations.\u201d  Id. at 504.  \nRegardless, the Secretary has authority to ensure \nthat the Task Force considers issuing particular recom-\nmendations.  The Secretary may propose a recommen-\ndation topic and remove Task Force members if they \nrefuse to consider it.  And the Secretary may issue reg-\nulations mandating certain recommendation priorities.  \nTaking a different tack, respondents object (Br. in \nSupport of Cert. 33-34) to the entire enterprise of sev-\nerability.  But \u201capart from some isolated detours,\u201d this \n\u201cCourt\u2019s power and preference\u201d to \u201cinvalidate a statute\u201d \nonly \u201cpartially\u201d has remained constant \u201c[f\u200a]rom Marbury \nv. Madison to the present.\u201d  American Ass\u2019n of Politi-\ncal Consultants, 591 U.S. at 626 (opinion of Kavanaugh, \nJ.).  As Chief Justice Marshall explained long ago, if any \npart of an act is \u201cunconstitutional, the provisions of that \npart may be disregarded while full effect will be given \nto such as are not repugnant to the constitution of the \nUnited States.\u201d  Bank of Hamilton v. Lessee of Am-\nbrose Dudley, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 492, 526 (1829); see also \nLoeb v. Columbia Township Trustees, 179 U.S. 472, 490 \n(1900) (\u201c[O]ne section of a statute may be repugnant to \n\n45 \n \nthe Constitution without rendering the whole act void.\u201d).  \nThe Court has consistently applied that approach in \nevery recent separation-of-powers decision that identi-\nfied constitutional defects.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 23-27; \nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 234-238 (2020) \n(opinion of Roberts, C.J.); Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 508-510.  If the Court believes that the Task Force\u2019s \ncurrent structure is unconstitutional, the Court should \napply its traditional severability principles. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nSEAN R.

For purposes of this paragraph, primary care \nresearch focuses on the first contact when illness or \nhealth concerns arise, the diagnosis, treatment or re-\nferral to specialty care, preventive care, and the re-\nlationship between the clinician and the patient in the \ncontext of the family and community. \n \n4  So in original. \n\n5a \n \n(2) Research \n \nIn carrying out this section, the Center shall con-\nduct and support research concerning\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe nature and characteristics of primary \ncare practice; \n \n(B) \nthe management of commonly occurring \nclinical problems; \n \n(C) \nthe management of undifferentiated clin-\nical problems; and \n \n(D) \nthe continuity and coordination of health \nservices. \n \n3. \n42 U.S.C. 300gg-13 provides: \nCoverage of preventive health services \n(a) \nIn general \nA group health plan and a health insurance issuer of-\nfering group or individual health insurance coverage \nshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not \nimpose any cost sharing requirements for\u2014 \n \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have in \neffect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current recom-\nmendations of the United States Preventive Services \nTask Force; \n \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on Immun-\nization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control \n\n6a \n \nand Prevention with respect to the individual in-\nvolved; and1 \n \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and adoles-\ncents, evidence-informed preventive care and screen-\nings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration.2 \n \n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in para-\ngraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive guide-\nlines supported by the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration for purposes of this paragraph.2 \n \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preventive \nService Task Force regarding breast cancer screen-\ning, mammography, and prevention shall be consid-\nered the most current other than those issued in or \naround November 2009. \nNothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit \na plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in \naddition to those recommended by United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for ser-\nvices that are not recommended by such Task Force. \n \n \n \n1  So in original.

This structuring provides moderate Task EIG by clarifying exactly what information is now needed to reduce uncertainty. The action's primary value lies in its contribution to Design EIG. It demonstrates a crucial and generalizable strategic principle for adversarial legal analysis: after processing one side's primary arguments, pause to model them and formulate a targeted plan to acquire the direct counterarguments from the opposing side. This methodical approach of 'mapping the argument, then seeking the rebuttal' is a cornerstone of efficient and effective SCOTUS prediction, making the Design EIG very high.",

Furthermore, I have established a preliminary hypothesis that the current conservative majority on the Court, which has demonstrated skepticism towards the administrative state, may be receptive to the Appointments Clause challenge. My focus was on gathering the specific arguments from the petitioner (the government) and the respondent to understand how they frame the case.\n\nThe petitioner's brief has now provided the government's precise legal strategy. My beliefs are updated to incorporate these specific arguments, which significantly clarify the legal battleground. The government's central argument is that Task Force members are **inferior officers**, not principal officers, and are therefore validly appointed by the HHS Secretary. This argument rests on the assertion that the Secretary exercises sufficient supervision and control, satisfying the constitutional standard articulated in precedents like *Edmond v. United States* and *United States v. Arthrex, Inc*.\n\nThe government identifies two primary mechanisms of Secretarial control:\n1.  **At-Will Removal Power:** The government asserts the Secretary can remove Task Force members at will, for any reason, describing this as \"perhaps the most 'powerful tool for control'\". This directly counters the Fifth Circuit's finding that the Task Force is unduly independent.\n2.  **Power to Deny Binding Effect:** The government argues the Secretary can review and effectively veto the Task Force's recommendations before they gain legal force. They point to the statutory provision (42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1)) mandating a \"minimum interval\" of at least one year between a recommendation's issuance and the date it becomes a binding coverage requirement. This interval, they contend, provides the necessary window for Secretarial review and decision-making.\n\nAs a fallback position, the government addresses the severability question. They argue that if the Court does find an Appointments Clause violation, the proper remedy is not to invalidate the Task Force's authority but to sever the specific statutory provision that the Fifth Circuit found problematic: 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6), the clause stating the Task Force shall be \"independent.\" The government explicitly frames this as the same remedial path the Court took in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, thereby curing the constitutional defect by restoring Secretarial control.\n\nMy analytical framework is now much more detailed. The key question is no longer just *whether* there is an Appointments Clause violation, but whether the Court will find the Secretary's claimed powers of at-will removal and review-during-interval to be legally sound and constitutionally sufficient. The government's heavy reliance on *Edmond* and *Arthrex* confirms these are the pivotal precedents. My next predictive step requires understanding how the respondents will attempt to dismantle these two pillars of the government's supervision argument.",

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7. See http://bit.ly/3Nrntbo [https://perma.cc/B68B-VTMW] (ar-\nchived website taken on September 28, 2023) (\u201cTask Force \nmembers are appointed by the Director of AHRQ to serve 4-\nyear terms.\u201d).  \n8. See Secretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment and \nProspective Appointment: Appointment Affidavits (June 28, \n2023), http://bit.ly/3Yt94C0 [https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN]; see \nalso http://bit.ly/4dR3xK7 (archived website taken on December \n20, 2023) (\u201cTask Force members are appointed by the Secretary \nof HHS to serve 4-year terms.\u201d); Opening Br. for the Federal \nDefendants, Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article.

In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet. App. 20a. The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure. Pet. \nApp. 23a (\u201c[T]he statutory scheme . . . envisions no su-\npervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure.\u201d); see also Jennings v.

The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id. (\u201c[T]he man-\ndates deprive Braidwood of the ability to choose whether \nand to what extent its insurance plan covers preventive \ncare.\u201d); Pet. App. 95a\u201397a (describing each of Braid-\nwood\u2019s Article III injuries). And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 7\u201319, Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. \n46. \n22. The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

R. Civ. P. \n58(a). \nThis action came on for consideration by the Court, \nand the issues having been duly considered and a deci-\nsion duly rendered in the Court\u2019s orders partially grant-\ning and partially denying the parties\u2019 motions for sum-\nmary judgment. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED that: \n\n 2a \n1)  All claims of Joel Miller and Gregory Scheideman \nin the above-entitled and numbered cause are \nhereby DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n \n2) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration (HRSA) do not, on the rec-\nord in this case, violate Article II\u2019s Appointments \nclause. Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to evolve, building upon my initial analysis of the core legal questions and the petitioner's arguments. My foundational beliefs remain stable: the case centers on the Appointments Clause and the severability of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's enabling statute, with precedents like *Lucia v. SEC*, *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, *Edmond v. United States*, and *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* forming the critical legal backdrop.\n\nMy knowledge of the petitioner's (the government's) position is now solid. They argue that Task Force members are inferior officers, not principal officers, because the HHS Secretary retains sufficient control. This control is manifested through two key mechanisms: (1) an asserted power to remove Task Force members at will, and (2) the ability to prevent a recommendation from becoming a binding insurance mandate during the statutory one-year \"minimum interval\" (42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1)). As a fallback, the government proposes that if the Court finds an Appointments Clause violation due to the Task Force's independence, the remedy is not to invalidate its work but to sever the specific \"independent\" clause (42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6)), a solution modeled directly on the Court's decision in *Arthrex*.\n\nThe latest observation, while an internal reasoning step, has significantly refined my analytical model by clarifying the exact points of contention. It confirms that the legal battleground is now precisely defined by the government's arguments. My predictive model is no longer just about gathering general information; it is now a targeted search for the respondents' (Braidwood Management, et al.) specific counterarguments. The key unresolved variables that will determine my prediction are now explicitly identified:\n\n1.  **Rebuttal to At-Will Removal:** How will the respondents legally and factually dismantle the government's claim that the HHS Secretary possesses an unencumbered power to remove Task Force members at will? They will likely argue that the statutory scheme, particularly the \"independent\" nature of the Task Force, implicitly or explicitly curtails such removal power.\n2.  **Rebuttal to Meaningful Review:** How will the respondents characterize the one-year interval? They will likely argue this is a mere waiting period for insurers to prepare, not a genuine opportunity for Secretarial review and veto. Their argument will be that the statute provides no mechanism for the Secretary to disapprove a recommendation and that once issued by the Task Force, its path to becoming a binding mandate is automatic, rendering the Secretary's role ministerial and failing the supervision test from *Edmond*.\n3.  **Counter-Argument on Severability:** What is the respondents' position on the government's proposed *Arthrex*-style remedy? They will likely argue that the Task Force's independence is central to the statutory design Congress intended and is therefore not severable. They may contend that striking the independence provision would so fundamentally alter the statute that the Court would be rewriting the law, making invalidation of the Task Force's authority the only appropriate remedy.\n\nMy belief state has thus progressed from a general understanding of the issues to a detailed map of one party's strategy, and now to a precise identification of the critical counter-arguments needed from the opposing party to weigh the competing claims and make an informed prediction.",

My predictive model is now stalled, awaiting input on how the current Supreme Court is likely to resolve these specific clashes. This action is perfectly tailored to address this uncertainty. By searching for scholarly analysis of the Court's most recent, relevant Appointments Clause cases (*Arthrex*, *Seila Law*), I can gain crucial insights into the current Justices' thinking on these exact issues. This information is not in the case documents themselves but is essential for predicting the outcome. The potential to significantly shift my posterior belief about the case outcome is therefore extremely high. From a design perspective, this action tests a critical strategic hypothesis: after mapping the parties' arguments, the next optimal step is to seek external analysis of the controlling precedents to model judicial leanings.

Arthrex, by Michael B. Rappaport Michael B. RappaportFebruary 19, 2025 Share: In U.S. v. Arthrex, the Supreme Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts held that administrative patent judges (APJs) were not inferior officers for purposes of the Appointments Clause since their decisions were not reviewable by any executive branch officer.\u00a0 While the result in the case may very well accord with the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, its reasoning when viewed from an originalist perspective is a mess. Roberts\u2019s opinion misunderstands the Appointments Clause provisions involving principal and inferior officers, viewing them as a protection of presidential power and responsibility rather than as a limit on presidential power designed to deter poor appointments to important offices.\u00a0 Roberts\u2019s opinion also appears to misread the principal case it relies upon, Edmond v. U.S., viewing it as supporting the result he reaches rather than suggesting the opposite conclusion. The Principal and Inferior Officer Provisions of the Appointments Clause The main and clearest problem with Roberts\u2019s opinion is that it fundamentally misunderstands the nature and purpose of the distinction between principal and inferior officers in the Appointments Clause.\u00a0 The majority opinion views the distinction between principal and inferior officers as primarily about presidential control and democratic accountability.\u00a0 Because no principal officer can reverse the decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), the President is denied control over the PTAB and cannot be seen as responsible for its decisions.\u00a0 As Roberts concludes his principal analysis of the defects of the statute, \u201cgiven the insulation of PTAB decisions from any executive review, the President can neither oversee the PTAB himself nor \u2018attribute the Board\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 And this failure to preserve presidential control is problematic because it undermines the purpose of the Appointments Clause to ensure political accountability of the President, \u201con whom all the people vote.\u201d From an originalist perspective, this analysis is mistaken.\u00a0 In fact, in some ways, this analysis of the Clause has the matter backward. First, the Constitution\u2019s differing treatment of principal and inferior officers is not mainly about presidential control.\u00a0 Instead, it is about limiting presidential power.\u00a0 The Constitution allows for the appointment of inferior officers by the President alone, heads of departments, or courts of law.\u00a0 But it makes clear that principal officers can only be appointed with the consent of the Senate.\u00a0 Even if the Senate wants to abdicate its responsibility to vote on the appointment of principal officers, it cannot do so.\u00a0 The purpose of this provision is clear.\u00a0 It is a check on the President appointing cronies or other questionable individuals to high executive office.\u00a0 Roberts\u2019s opinion largely misses this, barely mentioning the need for the senatorial check. Second, the Constitution\u2019s differing treatment of principal and inferior officers is also not chiefly about focusing responsibility on the President for the appointment.\u00a0 In fact, the President can be made more responsible for the appointment of an inferior officer if Congress vests his appointment in the President alone.\u00a0 Much the same result can be accomplished by vesting his appointment in the head of a department who is subject to presidential control. (It is true that vesting the appointment of an executive officer in a court of law would deprive the President of control over the appointment, assuming such an arrangement were constitutional.\u00a0 But given the infrequency in which executive officers are appointed by courts of law, the overall effect of the inferior officer appointment provision still seems to promote presidential control.) By contrast, the President does not entirely control the appointment of a principal officer.\u00a0 The President nominates but the appointment cannot occur without the Senate\u2019s consent.\u00a0 Thus, the President is less accountable for the appointment than he would be if the appointment were vested in the President alone or perhaps even in the head of a department he supervises.\u00a0 After all, the President\u2019s appointment might be rejected by the Senate and then the President might blame bad behavior by his next nominee on the fact that his preferred choice was rejected. To be sure, Alexander Hamilton justified appointments by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate on the ground that it would place primary responsibility on the President.\u00a0 But it is essential to remember that Hamilton was attempting to explain why the Constitution did not assign the appointment of officers to the legislature, which many of the states did at that time.\u00a0 While he correctly argued that appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate would focus more responsibility on a single person than would appointment by the legislature, he was not arguing \u2013 nor could he \u2013 that appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate placed more responsibility on the President than appointment by the President alone. Moreover, Roberts\u2019s argument that presidential appointment promotes democratic accountability is also problematic in another way.\u00a0 Roberts claims that it is only the President \u201con whom all the people vote,\u201d suggesting that Presidents are uniquely accountable to the electorate.\u00a0 But from an originalist perspective, this is something of an anachronism.\u00a0 While Presidents today are largely selected by a process under which all citizens can be thought to vote for the President, that was not written into the Constitution.\u00a0 When the Constitution was enacted, the members of the Electoral College could be selected any way that the state legislature chose, including by a vote of the state legislature.\u00a0 Direct democratic accountability was not an essential feature of presidential elections. The Test for an Inferior Officer Thus, Roberts\u2019s picture of the principal and inferior officer provisions of the Appointments Clause as promoting presidential control of agency officials and presidential responsibility for principal officer appointments is a serious distortion.\u00a0 These provisions were designed to ensure that important officers would be required to secure the consent of the Senate rather than to allow unilateral appointments by the executive. Given this understanding of the provisions, the question is how one distinguishes between principal and inferior officers and whether the APJs in Arthrex were principal or inferior officers.\u00a0 The answer here turns on the meaning of \u201cinferior officer.\u201d Unfortunately, this is a complicated question.\u00a0 There are several possible tests for an inferior officer, including but not limited to: An inferior officer must be subject to having their decision overturned by a principal officer. An inferior officer must be subject to removal from the entirety of their federal service by a principal officer. An inferior officer must be subject to removal by a principal officer from their authority to make a specific type of decision, such as removal of APJs from deciding inter partes cases. An inferior officer must be subject to a combination of these conditions, such as both 1 and 2. In Arthrex, Roberts concludes that, for adjudicative officers of the type under review, number 1 by itself is sufficient to determine whether someone is an inferior officer.\u00a0 He explicitly does not decide whether number 2 would be sufficient by itself but concludes that number 3 would not be enough to make someone an inferior officer. (Roberts\u2019s conclusion as to number 2 does not speak for a majority of the Court but only for four members.) Unfortunately, Roberts\u2019s opinion does not adequately justify these conclusions.\u00a0 He does provide some limited historical evidence for 1 but by itself it does not seem compelling.\u00a0 And he does not really explain why number 3 is insufficient to render someone an inferior officer.\u00a0 One might speculate that he deems number 3 insufficient because he does not believe that such a limited removal will sufficiently incentivize the inferior officer to follow the decision of the principal officer.\u00a0 But it is not clear why limited removal would not be sufficient if full removal would suffice. But it is not my purpose to be too critical of Roberts here. An originalist analysis of this issue is complicated and I tentatively lean towards the result that Roberts reaches.\u00a0 But Roberts makes two arguments for his result that have serious defects. First, Roberts attempts to address the argument that the Director had sufficient authority to control the panels by taking various actions to stack the panels in favor of the decisions he desires.\u00a0 Roberts responded: \u201cThat is not the solution. It is the problem.\u201d\u00a0 These mechanisms of Director control, whatever their effectiveness, are problematic because they \u201cblur the lines of accountability demanded by the Appointments Clause,\u201d leaving the public not knowing who to blame for a \u201cpernicious measure.\u201d I acknowledge that this argument has rhetorical force.\u00a0 Having discussed the purpose of the Appointments Clause as focusing responsibility on a democratically accountable President, Roberts uses that purpose to reject the powers that the Director has to achieve control. But while the argument has rhetorical force, it lacks originalist force.\u00a0 Since the differing treatment of principal and inferior officers under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause is based on ensuring a senatorial check on important officers rather than focusing responsibility on a democratically accountable President, his argument fails under originalism. Second, Roberts also relies upon the precedent of Edmond v. U.S., but his reliance is problematic.\u00a0 Since Edmond was written by Justice Scalia, it would seem to have strong originalist credibility.\u00a0 But whether or not Edmond is correctly decided, Roberts appears to misread Scalia\u2019s opinion. In Edmond, the Court concluded that the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals was composed of inferior officers because they were \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by principal officers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scalia noted that the Judge Advocate General could remove a Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals judge \u201cfrom his judicial assignment without cause.\u201d\u00a0 While the Judge Advocate General could not \u201creverse decisions of the court,\u201d other executive officials \u2013 the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) \u2013 could do so as the appellate court hearing appeals from the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals. Roberts\u2019s reliance on this opinion seems to support his conclusion that the APJs were not inferior officers because no one had the power to reverse their decisions.\u00a0 While the Director, like the Judge Advocate General in Edmond, might have had the power to remove APJs from their judicial assignments without cause, no one had the power to reverse them, as did the CAAF in Edmond. But closer inspection of the opinion shows that Roberts may have misread Scalia\u2019s opinion.\u00a0 It turns out that the CAAF did not have complete authority to reverse the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.\u00a0 The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals was entitled to significant deference as to fact questions.\u00a0 So long \u201cas there is some competent evidence in the record to establish each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the CAAF \u201cwill not reevaluate the facts.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, even if the CAAF disagreed with a decision, it could not reverse in certain cases. Scalia acknowledged this limitation but concluded that it did not render the judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals principal officers because the Court \u201chad no power to render a final decision on behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d Scalia\u2019s statement here appears to suggest that the power to reverse is not essential.\u00a0 Rather, the power to deprive someone of the authority to decide cases would be sufficient.\u00a0 This interpretation is not entirely clear because Scalia did make much of the fact that the CAAF had the power to reverse many of the decisions of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.\u00a0 Still, Scalia\u2019s words seem to suggest that the power to deprive an officer of the ability to decide a case was sufficient to render them an inferior officer.\u00a0 While Roberts might have plausibly interpreted Scalia to require some significant, if not complete, authority to reverse inferior officer decisions, he did not say so, treating Scalia\u2019s decision as if it largely decided the APJ issue. In the end, Roberts\u2019s opinion is an originalist mess.\u00a0 While it may reach the correct originalist conclusion, its reasoning is seriously deficient.\u00a0 It entirely misunderstands the reasons for the distinction between principal and inferior officers in the Appointments Clause, and it fails to explain or justify many of its conclusions.\u00a0 Courts relying on the opinion will be misled and may even be led further away from the Clause\u2019s original meaning.

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

ET AL. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF  APPEALS FOR \nTHE FEDERAL CIRCUIT  \nNo. 19 \u20131434.  Argued March 1, 2021\u2014Decided June 21 , 2021 * \nThe question in these cases is whether the authority of Administrative \nPatent Judges (APJs) to issue decisions on beha lf of the Executive \nBranch is consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitu-\ntion.  APJs conduct adversarial proceedings for challenging the valid-ity of an existing patent before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).  During such proceedings, t he PTAB sits in panels of at least \nthree of its members, who are predominantly APJs.  35 U.  S. C. \u00a7\u00a76(a), \n(c).  The Secretary of Commerce appoints all members of the PTAB \u2014\nincluding 200 -plus APJs\u2014except for the Director, who is nominated by \nthe President an d confirmed by the Senate.  \u00a7\u00a73(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), 6(a).  \nAfter Smith & Nephew, Inc., and ArthroCare Corp. (collectively, Smith & Nephew) petitioned for inter partes review of a patent secured by Arthrex, Inc., three APJs concluded that the patent was inval id.  On \nappeal to the Federal Circuit, Arthrex claimed that the structure of the \nPTAB violated the Appointments Clause, which specifies how the \nPresident may appoint officers to assist in carrying out his responsi-bilities.  Art.  II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  Arthrex argued that the APJs were principal \nofficers who must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and that their appointment by the Secretary of Commerce was therefore unconstitutional.  The Federal Circuit held \nthat the APJs were  principal officers whose appointments were uncon-\nstitutional because neither the Secretary nor Director can review their \ndecisions or remove them at will.  To remedy this constitutional viola-tion, the Federal Circuit invalidated the APJs\u2019 tenure protection s, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*\n Together with No. 19 \u20131452, Smith & Nephew, Inc., et al . v.

ARTHREX, INC. \nSyllabus \nmaking them removable at will by the Secretary. \nHeld : The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. \n941 F. 3d 1320, vacated and remanded. \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE  delivered the opinion of the Court with respect \nto Parts I and II, concluding that  the unreviewable authority wielded \nby APJs during inter partes review is incompatible with their appoint-\nment by the Secretary of Commerce to an inferior office. Pp. 6\u201319.\n(a) The Appointments Clause provides that only the President, with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate, can appoint principal officers. \nWith respect to inferior officers, the Clause permits Congress to vestappointment power \u201cin the President al one, in the Courts of Law, or in \nthe Heads of Departments.\u201d  Pp. 6\u20138.\n(b) In Edmond  v. United States,  520 U. S. 651, this Court explained\nthat an inferior officer must be \u201cdirected and supervised at some level\nby others who were appointed by Pr esidential nomination with the ad-\nvice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id., at 663.  Applying that test to Coast\nGuard Court of Criminal Appeals judges appointe d by the Secretary of\nTransportation, the Court held that the judges were inferior officers \nbecause they were effectively superv ised by a combination of Presiden-\ntially nominated and Senate confirmed officers in the Executive Branch. Id., at 664\u2013665.  What the Court in Edmond  found \u201csignifi-\ncant\u201d was that those judges had \u201cno po wer to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Execu-\ntive officers.\u201d Id., at 665. \nSuch review by a superior executiv e officer is absent here.  While the \nDirector has tools of administrative oversight, neither he nor any other\nsuperior executive officer can directly review decisions by APJs.  Only\nthe PTAB itself \u201cmay grant rehearings.\u201d  \u00a76(c).  This restriction on re -\nview relieves the Director of responsibility for the final decisions ren-\ndered by APJs under his charge.  Their decision\u2014the final word within \nthe Executive Branch\u2014com pels the Director to \u201cissue and publish a\ncertificate\u201d canceling or confirming patent claims he had previously al -\nlowed. \u00a7318(b). \nThe Government and Smith & Ne phew contend that the Director\nhas various ways to indirectly influence the course of inter partes re-\nview.  The Director, for example, co uld designate APJs predisposed to\ndecide a case in his preferred manner.  But such machinations blur the \nlines of accountability demanded by the Appointments Clause and \nleave the parties with neither an im partial decision by a panel of ex -\nperts nor a transparent decision for which a politically accountable of-\nficer must take responsibility.\nEven if the Director can refuse to designate APJs on future PTAB \npanels, he has no means of countermanding the final decision alreadyon the books.  Nor can the Secretary meaningfully control APJs \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 3 Cite as: 594 U.

And the possibility of an \nappeal to the Federal Circuit does not provide the necessary supervi-\nsion. APJs exercise executive powe r, and the President must be ulti-\nmately responsible for their actions.  See Arlington  v. FCC , 569 U. S. \n290, 305, n. 4. \nGiven the insulation of PTAB de cisions from any executive review,\nthe President can neither oversee th e PTAB himself nor \u201cattribute the \nBoard\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund \nv.

Pp. 8\u201314.\n(c) History reinforces the conclusi on that the unreviewable executive \npower exercised by APJs is incompatible with their status as inferior \nofficers. Founding-era congressional statutes and early decisions from \nthis Court indicate that adequate supervision entails review of deci-\nsions issued by inferior officers. See, e.g., 1 Stat. 66\u201367; Barnard  v. \nAshley , 18 How. 43, 45.  Congress carried that model of principal officer \nreview into the modern administrative state.  See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. \n\u00a7557(b). \nAccording to the Government and Smith & Nephew, heads of de-\npartment appoint a handful of contemporary officers who purportedly\nexercise final decisionmaking author ity.  Several of their examples,\nhowever, involve inferior officers whose decisions a superior executive \nofficer can review or implement a system for reviewing.  See, e.g., Frey-\ntag v. Commissioner , 501 U. S. 868.  Nor does the structure of the \nPTAB draw support from the predecessor Board of Appeals, which de-\ntermined the patentability of inventions in panels composed of exam-iners-in-chief without an appeal to the Commissioner.  44 Stat. 1335\u2013 \n1336.  Those Board decisions could be reviewed by the Court of Cus-\ntoms and Patent Appeals\u2014an executive tribunal\u2014and may also have\nbeen subject to the unilateral control of the agency head.  Pp. 14\u201318.\n(d) The Court does not attempt to \u201cset forth an exclusive criterion \nfor distinguishing between principal and inferior officers for Appoint -\nments Clause purposes.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U. S., at 661.  Many decisions \nby inferior officers do not bind th e Executive Branch to exercise exec-\nutive power in a particular manner, and the Court does not address supervision outside the context of adjudication.  Here, however, Con-\ngress has assigned APJs \u201csignificant authority\u201d in adjudicating the public rights of private parties, wh ile also insulating their decisions\nfrom review and their offices from removal.

Pp. 18\u201319.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE , joined by J USTICE ALITO, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH , \nand J USTICE BARRETT , concluded in Part III that  \u00a76(c) cannot constitu-\ntionally be enforced to the extent that its requirem ents prevent the \nDirector from reviewing final decisions rendered by APJs.  The Direc-\ntor accordingly may review final PTAB decisions and, upon review, \nmay issue decisions himself on behalf of the Board.  Section 6(c) other-wise remains operative as to the other members of the PTAB.  When \nreviewing such a decision by the Director, a court must decide the case\u201cconformably to the constitution, disregarding the law\u201d placing re -\nstrictions on his review authorit y in violation of Article II.  Marbury  v. \nMadison , 1 Cranch 137, 178. \nThe appropriate remedy is a remand to the Acting Director to decide \nwhether to rehear the petition filed by Smith & Nephew.  A limited \nremand provides an adequate opport unity for review by a principal of-\nficer.  Because the source of the constitutional violation is the restraint \non the review authority of the Dire ctor, rather than the appointment\nof APJs by the Secretary, Arthrex is not entitled to a hearing before anew panel of APJs.

The Board, composed largely of Administrative Pa-tent Judges appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, has \nthe final word within the Executive Branch on the validity of a challenged patent. Billions of dollars can turn on a \nBoard decision. \nUnder the Constitution, \u201c[t]he executive Power\u201d is vested\nin the President, who has the responsibility to \u201ctake Care \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nthat the Laws be faithfully execut ed.\u201d  Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 1; \u00a73. \nThe Appointments Clause provides that he may be assisted\nin carrying out that responsibility by officers nominated by him and confirmed by the Senate, as well as by other offic-\ners not appointed in that manner but whose work, we have \nheld, must be directed and supervised by an officer who has \nbeen. \u00a72, cl. 2. The question presented is whether the au-\nthority of the Board to issue decisions on behalf of the Ex-ecutive Branch is consistent with these constitutional pro-\nvisions. \nI \nA \nThe creation of a workable patent system was a congres-\nsional priority from the start.  The First Congress estab-lished the Patent Board\u2014consisting impressively of Secre-\ntary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War HenryKnox, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph\u2014to issue\npatents for inventions they deemed \u201csufficiently useful and \nimportant.\u201d \u00a71, 1 Stat. 109\u2013110. Jefferson, a renowned in-\nventor in his own right, \u201cwas charged with most of the re-\nsponsibility\u201d to administer the new patent system.  Fed-erico, Operation of the Patent Act of 1790, 18 J. Pat. Off.\nSoc. 237, 238\u2013239 (1936).  The Patent Board was a short-\nlived experiment because its me mbers had much else to do. \nJefferson candidly admitted that he had \u201cbeen obliged togive undue & uninformed opinions on rights often valuable\u201d without the \u201cgreat deal of ti me\u201d necessary to \u201cunderstand & \ndo justice by\u201d patent applicants.  Letter from T. Jefferson to H. Williamson (Apr. 1, 1792), in 6 Works of Thomas Jeffer-\nson 459 (P. Ford ed. 1904). \nIn 1793, Congress shifted to a registration system admin -\nistered by the Secretary of State. See 1 Stat. 319\u2013321. The Secretary no longer reviewed the substance of patent appli-\ncations but instead issued patents through a routine pro-cess \u201cas a ministerial officer.\u201d  Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 3 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nOpinion of the Court \n218, 241 (1832). The courts would make the initial deter-\nmination of patent validity in a subsequent judicial pro-\nceeding, such as an infringement suit. See 1 Stat. 322. This scheme unsurprisingly resulted in the Executive Branch is-\nsuing many invalid patents and the Judicial Branch having \nto decide many infringement cases. See S. Doc. No. 338, \n24th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1836).  Judge William Van Ness\u2014\nwho before taking the bench had served as second to Aaron Burr in his duel with Alexander Hamilton\u2014lamented that \nCongress had left the door \u201copen and unguarded\u201d for im -\nposters to secure patents, with the consequences of \u201clitiga-\ntion and endless trouble, if no t total ruin, to the true inven-\ntor.\u201d Thompson  v. Haight , 23 F. Cas. 1040, 1041\u20131042 (No. \n13,957) (CC SDNY 1826).  Congress heeded such concerns\nby returning the initial determination of patentability to\nthe Executive Branch, see 5 Stat. 117\u2013118, where it re-\nmains today.\nThe present system is administered by the Patent and \nTrademark Office (PTO), an executive agency within the Department of Commerce \u201cresponsible for the granting and\nissuing of patents\u201d in the name of the United States.  35 \nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71(a), 2(a)(1).  Congress has vested the \u201cpowers\nand duties\u201d of the PTO in a sole Director appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. \n\u00a73(a)(1). As agency head, the Director \u201cprovid[es] policy di -\nrection and management supervis ion\u201d for PTO officers and \nemployees. \u00a73(a)(2)(A).\nThis suit centers on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\n(PTAB), an executive adjudicatory body within the PTO es -\ntablished by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011.\n125 Stat. 313.  The PTAB sits in panels of at least three members drawn from the Director, the Deputy Director, the \nCommissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trade -\nmarks, and more than 200 Administrative Patent Judges(APJs). 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a76(a), (c).  The Secretary of Commerce \nappoints the members of the PTAB (except for the Director), \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  4 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nincluding the APJs at issue in this dispute.  \u00a7\u00a73(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), 6(a). Like the 1790 Patent Board, the modern \nBoard decides whether an invention satisfies the standards for patentability on review of decisions by primary examin-\ners. \u00a7\u00a76(b)(1), 134(a). \nThrough a variety of procedures, the PTAB can also take\na second look at patents prev iously issued by the PTO. \n\u00a7\u00a76(b)(2)\u2013(4).  One such procedure is inter partes review. \nEstablished in 2011, inter partes review is an adversarial \nprocess by which members of the PTAB reconsider whether \nexisting patents satisfy the novelty and nonobviousness re-quirements for inventions. See \u00a76(a) of the America Invents \nAct, 125 Stat. 299. Any person\u2014other than the patent \nowner himself\u2014can file a petition to institute inter partes\nreview of a patent.  35 U. S. C. \u00a7311(a).  The Director can \ninstitute review only if, among other requirements, he de-termines that the petitioner is reasonably likely to prevail\non at least one challenged patent claim.  \u00a7314(a).  Congress\nhas committed the decision to institute inter partes review \nto the Director\u2019s unreviewable discretion.  See Thryv, Inc. \nv. Click-To-Call Technologies, LP , 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) \n(slip op., at 6). By regulation, the Director has delegated this authority to the PTAB itself. 37 CFR \u00a742.4(a) (2020).\nThe Director designates at least three members of the\nPTAB (typically three APJs) to conduct an inter partes pro-ceeding. 35 U. S. C. \u00a76(c).  The PTAB then assumes control \nof the process, which resembles civil litigation in many re-\nspects. \u00a7316(c).  The PTAB must issue a final written deci-sion on all of the challenged patent claims within 12 to 18\nmonths of institution. \u00a7316(a)(11); see SAS Institute Inc.  v. \nIancu, 584 U.

Upon\nexpiration of the time to appeal or termination of any ap-\npeal, \u201cthe Director shall issue and publish a certificate can-\nceling any claim of the patent finally determined to be un-patentable, confirming any claim of the patent determined\nto be patentable, and incorporating in the patent by opera-\ntion of the certificate any ne w or amended claim determined \nto be patentable.\u201d \u00a7318(b). \nB \nArthrex, Inc. develops medi cal devices and procedures for \northopedic surgery. In 2015, it secured a patent on a surgi-cal device for reattaching soft  tissue to bone without tying\na knot, U. S. Patent No. 9,179,907 (\u2019907 patent).  Arthrex soon claimed that Smith & Nephew, Inc. and ArthroCare Corp. (collectively, Smith & Nephew) had infringed the \u2019907\npatent, and the dispute eventually made its way to inter \npartes review in the PTO.  Three APJs formed the PTAB panel that conducted the proceeding and ultimately con-\ncluded that a prior patent a pplication \u201canticipated\u201d the in-\nvention claimed by the \u2019907 pate nt, so that Arthrex\u2019s patent\nwas invalid. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131434, \np. 128a.\nOn appeal to the Federal Circuit, Arthrex raised for the \nfirst time an argument premised on the AppointmentsClause of the Constitution. That Clause specifies how the\nPresident may appoint officers who assist him in carrying \nout his responsibilities.  Principal  officers must be ap-\npointed by the President with the advice and consent of theSenate, while inferior  officers may be appointed by the \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 6 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nPresident alone, the head of an executive department, or a \ncourt. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  Arthrex argued that the APJs were\nprincipal officers and therefore that their appointment bythe Secretary of Commerce was unconstitutional.  The Gov -\nernment intervened to defend the appointment procedure.\nThe Federal Circuit agreed with Arthrex that APJs were\nprincipal officers. 941 F. 3d 1320, 1335 (2019). Neither the Secretary nor Director had the aut hority to review their de-\ncisions or to remove them at will. The Federal Circuit held \nthat these restrictions meant that APJs were themselves \nprincipal officers, not inferior officers under the direction ofthe Secretary or Director. \nTo fix this constitutional vi olation, the Federal Circuit in-\nvalidated the tenure protections for APJs.  Making APJs \nremovable at will by the Secretary, the panel held, prospec-\ntively \u201crenders them inferior ra ther than principal officers.\u201d \nId., at 1338. The Federal Circuit vacated the PTAB\u2019s deci-\nsion and remanded for a fresh hearing before a new panel of APJs, who would no longer enjoy protection against re-\nmoval. Id., at 1338\u20131340. \nThis satisfied no one.  The Government, Smith & \nNephew, and Arthrex each requested rehearing en banc, \nwhich the Court of Appeals denied. 953 F. 3d 760, 761 (2020) (per curiam ). The parties then requested review of \ndifferent aspects of the panel\u2019 s decision in three petitions \nfor certiorari. \nWe granted those petitions to consider whether the\nPTAB\u2019s structure is consistent with the AppointmentsClause, and the appropriate remedy if it is not.  592 U.

See Oil States , \n584 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). \nThe starting point for each party\u2019s analysis is our opinion \nin Edmond.  There we explained that \u201c[w]hether one is an\n\u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a superior\u201dother than the President.  520 U. S., at 662.  An inferior \nofficer must be \u201cdirected and supervised at some level by\nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination with\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d Id., at 663. \nIn Edmond, we applied this test to  adjudicative officials \nwithin the Executive Branch\u2014 specifically, Coast Guard \nCourt of Criminal Appeals ju dges appointed by the Secre -\ntary of Transportation.  See id., at 658.  We held that the \njudges were inferior officers because they were effectively\nsupervised by a combination of Presidentially nominated and Senate confirmed officers in the Executive Branch: \nfirst, the Judge Advocate Ge neral, who \u201cexercise[d] admin-\nistrative oversight over the Court of Criminal Appeals\u201d by\nprescribing rules of procedure and formulating policies for \ncourt-martial cases, and could also \u201cremove a Court of \nCriminal Appeals judge from his judicial assignment with-\nout cause\u201d; and second, the Court of Appeals for the ArmedForces, an executive tribunal that could review the judges\u2019\ndecisions under a de novo  standard for legal issues and a \ndeferential standard for factual issues.  Id., at 664\u2013665. \n\u201cWhat is significant,\u201d we concluded, \u201cis that the judges of \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals have no power to render a \nfinal decision on behalf of the United States unless permit-\nted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d  Id., at 665. \nCongress structured the PTAB differently, providing only\nhalf of the \u201cdivided\u201d supervision to which judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals were subject.

Id., \nat 665. The only possibility of review is a petition for re-hearing, but Congress unambiguously specified that \u201c[o]nly \nthe Patent and Trial Appeal Board may grant rehearings.\u201d \u00a76(c).

For another, he could assemble \nan entirely new panel consisting of himself and two other \nofficers appointed by the Se cretary\u2014in practice, the Com-\nmissioner for Patents and the APJ presently designated as Chief Judge\u2014to decide whether to overturn a decision and\nreach a different outcome binding on future panels.

Arthrex, by Michael B. Rappaport Michael B. RappaportFebruary 19, 2025 Share: In U.S. v. Arthrex, the Supreme Court in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts held that administrative patent judges (APJs) were not inferior officers for purposes of the Appointments Clause since their decisions were not reviewable by any executive branch officer.\u00a0 While the result in the case may very well accord with the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, its reasoning when viewed from an originalist perspective is a mess. Roberts\u2019s opinion misunderstands the Appointments Clause provisions involving principal and inferior officers, viewing them as a protection of presidential power and responsibility rather than as a limit on presidential power designed to deter poor appointments to important offices.\u00a0 Roberts\u2019s opinion also appears to misread the principal case it relies upon, Edmond v. U.S., viewing it as supporting the result he reaches rather than suggesting the opposite conclusion. The Principal and Inferior Officer Provisions of the Appointments Clause The main and clearest problem with Roberts\u2019s opinion is that it fundamentally misunderstands the nature and purpose of the distinction between principal and inferior officers in the Appointments Clause.\u00a0 The majority opinion views the distinction between principal and inferior officers as primarily about presidential control and democratic accountability.\u00a0 Because no principal officer can reverse the decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), the President is denied control over the PTAB and cannot be seen as responsible for its decisions.\u00a0 As Roberts concludes his principal analysis of the defects of the statute, \u201cgiven the insulation of PTAB decisions from any executive review, the President can neither oversee the PTAB himself nor \u2018attribute the Board\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 And this failure to preserve presidential control is problematic because it undermines the purpose of the Appointments Clause to ensure political accountability of the President, \u201con whom all the people vote.\u201d From an originalist perspective, this analysis is mistaken.\u00a0 In fact, in some ways, this analysis of the Clause has the matter backward. First, the Constitution\u2019s differing treatment of principal and inferior officers is not mainly about presidential control.\u00a0 Instead, it is about limiting presidential power.\u00a0 The Constitution allows for the appointment of inferior officers by the President alone, heads of departments, or courts of law.\u00a0 But it makes clear that principal officers can only be appointed with the consent of the Senate.\u00a0 Even if the Senate wants to abdicate its responsibility to vote on the appointment of principal officers, it cannot do so.\u00a0 The purpose of this provision is clear.\u00a0 It is a check on the President appointing cronies or other questionable individuals to high executive office.\u00a0 Roberts\u2019s opinion largely misses this, barely mentioning the need for the senatorial check. Second, the Constitution\u2019s differing treatment of principal and inferior officers is also not chiefly about focusing responsibility on the President for the appointment.\u00a0 In fact, the President can be made more responsible for the appointment of an inferior officer if Congress vests his appointment in the President alone.\u00a0 Much the same result can be accomplished by vesting his appointment in the head of a department who is subject to presidential control. (It is true that vesting the appointment of an executive officer in a court of law would deprive the President of control over the appointment, assuming such an arrangement were constitutional.\u00a0 But given the infrequency in which executive officers are appointed by courts of law, the overall effect of the inferior officer appointment provision still seems to promote presidential control.) By contrast, the President does not entirely control the appointment of a principal officer.\u00a0 The President nominates but the appointment cannot occur without the Senate\u2019s consent.\u00a0 Thus, the President is less accountable for the appointment than he would be if the appointment were vested in the President alone or perhaps even in the head of a department he supervises.\u00a0 After all, the President\u2019s appointment might be rejected by the Senate and then the President might blame bad behavior by his next nominee on the fact that his preferred choice was rejected. To be sure, Alexander Hamilton justified appointments by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate on the ground that it would place primary responsibility on the President.\u00a0 But it is essential to remember that Hamilton was attempting to explain why the Constitution did not assign the appointment of officers to the legislature, which many of the states did at that time.\u00a0 While he correctly argued that appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate would focus more responsibility on a single person than would appointment by the legislature, he was not arguing \u2013 nor could he \u2013 that appointment by the President with the consent of the Senate placed more responsibility on the President than appointment by the President alone. Moreover, Roberts\u2019s argument that presidential appointment promotes democratic accountability is also problematic in another way.\u00a0 Roberts claims that it is only the President \u201con whom all the people vote,\u201d suggesting that Presidents are uniquely accountable to the electorate.\u00a0 But from an originalist perspective, this is something of an anachronism.\u00a0 While Presidents today are largely selected by a process under which all citizens can be thought to vote for the President, that was not written into the Constitution.\u00a0 When the Constitution was enacted, the members of the Electoral College could be selected any way that the state legislature chose, including by a vote of the state legislature.\u00a0 Direct democratic accountability was not an essential feature of presidential elections. The Test for an Inferior Officer Thus, Roberts\u2019s picture of the principal and inferior officer provisions of the Appointments Clause as promoting presidential control of agency officials and presidential responsibility for principal officer appointments is a serious distortion.\u00a0 These provisions were designed to ensure that important officers would be required to secure the consent of the Senate rather than to allow unilateral appointments by the executive. Given this understanding of the provisions, the question is how one distinguishes between principal and inferior officers and whether the APJs in Arthrex were principal or inferior officers.\u00a0 The answer here turns on the meaning of \u201cinferior officer.\u201d Unfortunately, this is a complicated question.\u00a0 There are several possible tests for an inferior officer, including but not limited to: An inferior officer must be subject to having their decision overturned by a principal officer. An inferior officer must be subject to removal from the entirety of their federal service by a principal officer. An inferior officer must be subject to removal by a principal officer from their authority to make a specific type of decision, such as removal of APJs from deciding inter partes cases. An inferior officer must be subject to a combination of these conditions, such as both 1 and 2. In Arthrex, Roberts concludes that, for adjudicative officers of the type under review, number 1 by itself is sufficient to determine whether someone is an inferior officer.\u00a0 He explicitly does not decide whether number 2 would be sufficient by itself but concludes that number 3 would not be enough to make someone an inferior officer. (Roberts\u2019s conclusion as to number 2 does not speak for a majority of the Court but only for four members.) Unfortunately, Roberts\u2019s opinion does not adequately justify these conclusions.\u00a0 He does provide some limited historical evidence for 1 but by itself it does not seem compelling.\u00a0 And he does not really explain why number 3 is insufficient to render someone an inferior officer.\u00a0 One might speculate that he deems number 3 insufficient because he does not believe that such a limited removal will sufficiently incentivize the inferior officer to follow the decision of the principal officer.\u00a0 But it is not clear why limited removal would not be sufficient if full removal would suffice. But it is not my purpose to be too critical of Roberts here. An originalist analysis of this issue is complicated and I tentatively lean towards the result that Roberts reaches.\u00a0 But Roberts makes two arguments for his result that have serious defects. First, Roberts attempts to address the argument that the Director had sufficient authority to control the panels by taking various actions to stack the panels in favor of the decisions he desires.\u00a0 Roberts responded: \u201cThat is not the solution. It is the problem.\u201d\u00a0 These mechanisms of Director control, whatever their effectiveness, are problematic because they \u201cblur the lines of accountability demanded by the Appointments Clause,\u201d leaving the public not knowing who to blame for a \u201cpernicious measure.\u201d I acknowledge that this argument has rhetorical force.\u00a0 Having discussed the purpose of the Appointments Clause as focusing responsibility on a democratically accountable President, Roberts uses that purpose to reject the powers that the Director has to achieve control. But while the argument has rhetorical force, it lacks originalist force.\u00a0 Since the differing treatment of principal and inferior officers under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause is based on ensuring a senatorial check on important officers rather than focusing responsibility on a democratically accountable President, his argument fails under originalism. Second, Roberts also relies upon the precedent of Edmond v. U.S., but his reliance is problematic.\u00a0 Since Edmond was written by Justice Scalia, it would seem to have strong originalist credibility.\u00a0 But whether or not Edmond is correctly decided, Roberts appears to misread Scalia\u2019s opinion. In Edmond, the Court concluded that the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals was composed of inferior officers because they were \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by principal officers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scalia noted that the Judge Advocate General could remove a Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals judge \u201cfrom his judicial assignment without cause.\u201d\u00a0 While the Judge Advocate General could not \u201creverse decisions of the court,\u201d other executive officials \u2013 the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) \u2013 could do so as the appellate court hearing appeals from the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals. Roberts\u2019s reliance on this opinion seems to support his conclusion that the APJs were not inferior officers because no one had the power to reverse their decisions.\u00a0 While the Director, like the Judge Advocate General in Edmond, might have had the power to remove APJs from their judicial assignments without cause, no one had the power to reverse them, as did the CAAF in Edmond. But closer inspection of the opinion shows that Roberts may have misread Scalia\u2019s opinion.\u00a0 It turns out that the CAAF did not have complete authority to reverse the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.\u00a0 The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals was entitled to significant deference as to fact questions.\u00a0 So long \u201cas there is some competent evidence in the record to establish each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the CAAF \u201cwill not reevaluate the facts.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, even if the CAAF disagreed with a decision, it could not reverse in certain cases. Scalia acknowledged this limitation but concluded that it did not render the judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals principal officers because the Court \u201chad no power to render a final decision on behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d Scalia\u2019s statement here appears to suggest that the power to reverse is not essential.\u00a0 Rather, the power to deprive someone of the authority to decide cases would be sufficient.\u00a0 This interpretation is not entirely clear because Scalia did make much of the fact that the CAAF had the power to reverse many of the decisions of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.\u00a0 Still, Scalia\u2019s words seem to suggest that the power to deprive an officer of the ability to decide a case was sufficient to render them an inferior officer.\u00a0 While Roberts might have plausibly interpreted Scalia to require some significant, if not complete, authority to reverse inferior officer decisions, he did not say so, treating Scalia\u2019s decision as if it largely decided the APJ issue. In the end, Roberts\u2019s opinion is an originalist mess.\u00a0 While it may reach the correct originalist conclusion, its reasoning is seriously deficient.\u00a0 It entirely misunderstands the reasons for the distinction between principal and inferior officers in the Appointments Clause, and it fails to explain or justify many of its conclusions.\u00a0 Courts relying on the opinion will be misled and may even be led further away from the Clause\u2019s original meaning.

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

Argued March 1, 2021\u2014Decided June 21 , 2021 * \nThe question in these cases is whether the authority of Administrative \nPatent Judges (APJs) to issue decisions on beha lf of the Executive \nBranch is consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitu-\ntion.  APJs conduct adversarial proceedings for challenging the valid-ity of an existing patent before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).  During such proceedings, t he PTAB sits in panels of at least \nthree of its members, who are predominantly APJs.  35 U.  S. C. \u00a7\u00a76(a), \n(c).  The Secretary of Commerce appoints all members of the PTAB \u2014\nincluding 200 -plus APJs\u2014except for the Director, who is nominated by \nthe President an d confirmed by the Senate.  \u00a7\u00a73(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), 6(a).  \nAfter Smith & Nephew, Inc., and ArthroCare Corp. (collectively, Smith & Nephew) petitioned for inter partes review of a patent secured by Arthrex, Inc., three APJs concluded that the patent was inval id.  On \nappeal to the Federal Circuit, Arthrex claimed that the structure of the \nPTAB violated the Appointments Clause, which specifies how the \nPresident may appoint officers to assist in carrying out his responsi-bilities.  Art.  II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  Arthrex argued that the APJs were principal \nofficers who must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and that their appointment by the Secretary of Commerce was therefore unconstitutional.  The Federal Circuit held \nthat the APJs were  principal officers whose appointments were uncon-\nstitutional because neither the Secretary nor Director can review their \ndecisions or remove them at will.  To remedy this constitutional viola-tion, the Federal Circuit invalidated the APJs\u2019 tenure protection s, \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*\n Together with No. 19 \u20131452, Smith & Nephew, Inc., et al . v.

ARTHREX, INC. \nSyllabus \nmaking them removable at will by the Secretary. \nHeld : The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. \n941 F. 3d 1320, vacated and remanded. \nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE  delivered the opinion of the Court with respect \nto Parts I and II, concluding that  the unreviewable authority wielded \nby APJs during inter partes review is incompatible with their appoint-\nment by the Secretary of Commerce to an inferior office. Pp. 6\u201319.\n(a) The Appointments Clause provides that only the President, with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate, can appoint principal officers. \nWith respect to inferior officers, the Clause permits Congress to vestappointment power \u201cin the President al one, in the Courts of Law, or in \nthe Heads of Departments.\u201d  Pp. 6\u20138.\n(b) In Edmond  v. United States,  520 U. S. 651, this Court explained\nthat an inferior officer must be \u201cdirected and supervised at some level\nby others who were appointed by Pr esidential nomination with the ad-\nvice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id., at 663.  Applying that test to Coast\nGuard Court of Criminal Appeals judges appointe d by the Secretary of\nTransportation, the Court held that the judges were inferior officers \nbecause they were effectively superv ised by a combination of Presiden-\ntially nominated and Senate confirmed officers in the Executive Branch. Id., at 664\u2013665.  What the Court in Edmond  found \u201csignifi-\ncant\u201d was that those judges had \u201cno po wer to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Execu-\ntive officers.\u201d Id., at 665. \nSuch review by a superior executiv e officer is absent here.  While the \nDirector has tools of administrative oversight, neither he nor any other\nsuperior executive officer can directly review decisions by APJs.  Only\nthe PTAB itself \u201cmay grant rehearings.\u201d  \u00a76(c).  This restriction on re -\nview relieves the Director of responsibility for the final decisions ren-\ndered by APJs under his charge.  Their decision\u2014the final word within \nthe Executive Branch\u2014com pels the Director to \u201cissue and publish a\ncertificate\u201d canceling or confirming patent claims he had previously al -\nlowed. \u00a7318(b). \nThe Government and Smith & Ne phew contend that the Director\nhas various ways to indirectly influence the course of inter partes re-\nview.  The Director, for example, co uld designate APJs predisposed to\ndecide a case in his preferred manner.  But such machinations blur the \nlines of accountability demanded by the Appointments Clause and \nleave the parties with neither an im partial decision by a panel of ex -\nperts nor a transparent decision for which a politically accountable of-\nficer must take responsibility.\nEven if the Director can refuse to designate APJs on future PTAB \npanels, he has no means of countermanding the final decision alreadyon the books.  Nor can the Secretary meaningfully control APJs \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n 3 Cite as: 594 U.

And the possibility of an \nappeal to the Federal Circuit does not provide the necessary supervi-\nsion. APJs exercise executive powe r, and the President must be ulti-\nmately responsible for their actions.  See Arlington  v. FCC , 569 U. S. \n290, 305, n. 4. \nGiven the insulation of PTAB de cisions from any executive review,\nthe President can neither oversee th e PTAB himself nor \u201cattribute the \nBoard\u2019s failings to those whom he can oversee.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund \nv.

Pp. 8\u201314.\n(c) History reinforces the conclusi on that the unreviewable executive \npower exercised by APJs is incompatible with their status as inferior \nofficers. Founding-era congressional statutes and early decisions from \nthis Court indicate that adequate supervision entails review of deci-\nsions issued by inferior officers. See, e.g., 1 Stat. 66\u201367; Barnard  v. \nAshley , 18 How. 43, 45.  Congress carried that model of principal officer \nreview into the modern administrative state.  See, e.g., 5 U. S. C. \n\u00a7557(b). \nAccording to the Government and Smith & Nephew, heads of de-\npartment appoint a handful of contemporary officers who purportedly\nexercise final decisionmaking author ity.  Several of their examples,\nhowever, involve inferior officers whose decisions a superior executive \nofficer can review or implement a system for reviewing.  See, e.g., Frey-\ntag v. Commissioner , 501 U. S. 868.  Nor does the structure of the \nPTAB draw support from the predecessor Board of Appeals, which de-\ntermined the patentability of inventions in panels composed of exam-iners-in-chief without an appeal to the Commissioner.  44 Stat. 1335\u2013 \n1336.  Those Board decisions could be reviewed by the Court of Cus-\ntoms and Patent Appeals\u2014an executive tribunal\u2014and may also have\nbeen subject to the unilateral control of the agency head.  Pp. 14\u201318.\n(d) The Court does not attempt to \u201cset forth an exclusive criterion \nfor distinguishing between principal and inferior officers for Appoint -\nments Clause purposes.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U. S., at 661.  Many decisions \nby inferior officers do not bind th e Executive Branch to exercise exec-\nutive power in a particular manner, and the Court does not address supervision outside the context of adjudication.  Here, however, Con-\ngress has assigned APJs \u201csignificant authority\u201d in adjudicating the public rights of private parties, wh ile also insulating their decisions\nfrom review and their offices from removal.

Pp. 18\u201319.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE , joined by J USTICE ALITO, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH , \nand J USTICE BARRETT , concluded in Part III that  \u00a76(c) cannot constitu-\ntionally be enforced to the extent that its requirem ents prevent the \nDirector from reviewing final decisions rendered by APJs.  The Direc-\ntor accordingly may review final PTAB decisions and, upon review, \nmay issue decisions himself on behalf of the Board.  Section 6(c) other-wise remains operative as to the other members of the PTAB.  When \nreviewing such a decision by the Director, a court must decide the case\u201cconformably to the constitution, disregarding the law\u201d placing re -\nstrictions on his review authorit y in violation of Article II.  Marbury  v. \nMadison , 1 Cranch 137, 178. \nThe appropriate remedy is a remand to the Acting Director to decide \nwhether to rehear the petition filed by Smith & Nephew.  A limited \nremand provides an adequate opport unity for review by a principal of-\nficer.  Because the source of the constitutional violation is the restraint \non the review authority of the Dire ctor, rather than the appointment\nof APJs by the Secretary, Arthrex is not entitled to a hearing before anew panel of APJs.

The Board, composed largely of Administrative Pa-tent Judges appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, has \nthe final word within the Executive Branch on the validity of a challenged patent. Billions of dollars can turn on a \nBoard decision. \nUnder the Constitution, \u201c[t]he executive Power\u201d is vested\nin the President, who has the responsibility to \u201ctake Care \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nthat the Laws be faithfully execut ed.\u201d  Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 1; \u00a73. \nThe Appointments Clause provides that he may be assisted\nin carrying out that responsibility by officers nominated by him and confirmed by the Senate, as well as by other offic-\ners not appointed in that manner but whose work, we have \nheld, must be directed and supervised by an officer who has \nbeen. \u00a72, cl. 2. The question presented is whether the au-\nthority of the Board to issue decisions on behalf of the Ex-ecutive Branch is consistent with these constitutional pro-\nvisions. \nI \nA \nThe creation of a workable patent system was a congres-\nsional priority from the start.  The First Congress estab-lished the Patent Board\u2014consisting impressively of Secre-\ntary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War HenryKnox, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph\u2014to issue\npatents for inventions they deemed \u201csufficiently useful and \nimportant.\u201d \u00a71, 1 Stat. 109\u2013110. Jefferson, a renowned in-\nventor in his own right, \u201cwas charged with most of the re-\nsponsibility\u201d to administer the new patent system.  Fed-erico, Operation of the Patent Act of 1790, 18 J. Pat. Off.\nSoc. 237, 238\u2013239 (1936).  The Patent Board was a short-\nlived experiment because its me mbers had much else to do. \nJefferson candidly admitted that he had \u201cbeen obliged togive undue & uninformed opinions on rights often valuable\u201d without the \u201cgreat deal of ti me\u201d necessary to \u201cunderstand & \ndo justice by\u201d patent applicants.  Letter from T. Jefferson to H. Williamson (Apr. 1, 1792), in 6 Works of Thomas Jeffer-\nson 459 (P. Ford ed. 1904). \nIn 1793, Congress shifted to a registration system admin -\nistered by the Secretary of State. See 1 Stat. 319\u2013321. The Secretary no longer reviewed the substance of patent appli-\ncations but instead issued patents through a routine pro-cess \u201cas a ministerial officer.\u201d  Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 3 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nOpinion of the Court \n218, 241 (1832). The courts would make the initial deter-\nmination of patent validity in a subsequent judicial pro-\nceeding, such as an infringement suit. See 1 Stat. 322. This scheme unsurprisingly resulted in the Executive Branch is-\nsuing many invalid patents and the Judicial Branch having \nto decide many infringement cases. See S. Doc. No. 338, \n24th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1836).  Judge William Van Ness\u2014\nwho before taking the bench had served as second to Aaron Burr in his duel with Alexander Hamilton\u2014lamented that \nCongress had left the door \u201copen and unguarded\u201d for im -\nposters to secure patents, with the consequences of \u201clitiga-\ntion and endless trouble, if no t total ruin, to the true inven-\ntor.\u201d Thompson  v. Haight , 23 F. Cas. 1040, 1041\u20131042 (No. \n13,957) (CC SDNY 1826).  Congress heeded such concerns\nby returning the initial determination of patentability to\nthe Executive Branch, see 5 Stat. 117\u2013118, where it re-\nmains today.\nThe present system is administered by the Patent and \nTrademark Office (PTO), an executive agency within the Department of Commerce \u201cresponsible for the granting and\nissuing of patents\u201d in the name of the United States.  35 \nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71(a), 2(a)(1).  Congress has vested the \u201cpowers\nand duties\u201d of the PTO in a sole Director appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate. \n\u00a73(a)(1). As agency head, the Director \u201cprovid[es] policy di -\nrection and management supervis ion\u201d for PTO officers and \nemployees. \u00a73(a)(2)(A).\nThis suit centers on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\n(PTAB), an executive adjudicatory body within the PTO es -\ntablished by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011.\n125 Stat. 313.  The PTAB sits in panels of at least three members drawn from the Director, the Deputy Director, the \nCommissioner for Patents, the Commissioner for Trade -\nmarks, and more than 200 Administrative Patent Judges(APJs). 35 U.

Like the 1790 Patent Board, the modern \nBoard decides whether an invention satisfies the standards for patentability on review of decisions by primary examin-\ners. \u00a7\u00a76(b)(1), 134(a). \nThrough a variety of procedures, the PTAB can also take\na second look at patents prev iously issued by the PTO. \n\u00a7\u00a76(b)(2)\u2013(4).  One such procedure is inter partes review. \nEstablished in 2011, inter partes review is an adversarial \nprocess by which members of the PTAB reconsider whether \nexisting patents satisfy the novelty and nonobviousness re-quirements for inventions. See \u00a76(a) of the America Invents \nAct, 125 Stat. 299. Any person\u2014other than the patent \nowner himself\u2014can file a petition to institute inter partes\nreview of a patent.  35 U. S. C. \u00a7311(a).  The Director can \ninstitute review only if, among other requirements, he de-termines that the petitioner is reasonably likely to prevail\non at least one challenged patent claim.  \u00a7314(a).  Congress\nhas committed the decision to institute inter partes review \nto the Director\u2019s unreviewable discretion.  See Thryv, Inc. \nv. Click-To-Call Technologies, LP , 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) \n(slip op., at 6). By regulation, the Director has delegated this authority to the PTAB itself. 37 CFR \u00a742.4(a) (2020).\nThe Director designates at least three members of the\nPTAB (typically three APJs) to conduct an inter partes pro-ceeding. 35 U. S. C. \u00a76(c).  The PTAB then assumes control \nof the process, which resembles civil litigation in many re-\nspects. \u00a7316(c).  The PTAB must issue a final written deci-sion on all of the challenged patent claims within 12 to 18\nmonths of institution. \u00a7316(a)(11); see SAS Institute Inc.  v. \nIancu, 584 U.

Upon\nexpiration of the time to appeal or termination of any ap-\npeal, \u201cthe Director shall issue and publish a certificate can-\nceling any claim of the patent finally determined to be un-patentable, confirming any claim of the patent determined\nto be patentable, and incorporating in the patent by opera-\ntion of the certificate any ne w or amended claim determined \nto be patentable.\u201d \u00a7318(b). \nB \nArthrex, Inc. develops medi cal devices and procedures for \northopedic surgery. In 2015, it secured a patent on a surgi-cal device for reattaching soft  tissue to bone without tying\na knot, U. S. Patent No. 9,179,907 (\u2019907 patent).  Arthrex soon claimed that Smith & Nephew, Inc. and ArthroCare Corp. (collectively, Smith & Nephew) had infringed the \u2019907\npatent, and the dispute eventually made its way to inter \npartes review in the PTO.  Three APJs formed the PTAB panel that conducted the proceeding and ultimately con-\ncluded that a prior patent a pplication \u201canticipated\u201d the in-\nvention claimed by the \u2019907 pate nt, so that Arthrex\u2019s patent\nwas invalid. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 19\u20131434, \np. 128a.\nOn appeal to the Federal Circuit, Arthrex raised for the \nfirst time an argument premised on the AppointmentsClause of the Constitution. That Clause specifies how the\nPresident may appoint officers who assist him in carrying \nout his responsibilities.  Principal  officers must be ap-\npointed by the President with the advice and consent of theSenate, while inferior  officers may be appointed by the \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 6 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nPresident alone, the head of an executive department, or a \ncourt. Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  Arthrex argued that the APJs were\nprincipal officers and therefore that their appointment bythe Secretary of Commerce was unconstitutional.  The Gov -\nernment intervened to defend the appointment procedure.\nThe Federal Circuit agreed with Arthrex that APJs were\nprincipal officers. 941 F. 3d 1320, 1335 (2019). Neither the Secretary nor Director had the aut hority to review their de-\ncisions or to remove them at will. The Federal Circuit held \nthat these restrictions meant that APJs were themselves \nprincipal officers, not inferior officers under the direction ofthe Secretary or Director. \nTo fix this constitutional vi olation, the Federal Circuit in-\nvalidated the tenure protections for APJs.  Making APJs \nremovable at will by the Secretary, the panel held, prospec-\ntively \u201crenders them inferior ra ther than principal officers.\u201d \nId., at 1338. The Federal Circuit vacated the PTAB\u2019s deci-\nsion and remanded for a fresh hearing before a new panel of APJs, who would no longer enjoy protection against re-\nmoval. Id., at 1338\u20131340. \nThis satisfied no one.  The Government, Smith & \nNephew, and Arthrex each requested rehearing en banc, \nwhich the Court of Appeals denied. 953 F. 3d 760, 761 (2020) (per curiam ). The parties then requested review of \ndifferent aspects of the panel\u2019 s decision in three petitions \nfor certiorari. \nWe granted those petitions to consider whether the\nPTAB\u2019s structure is consistent with the AppointmentsClause, and the appropriate remedy if it is not.  592 U.

See Oil States , \n584 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 8\u20139). \nThe starting point for each party\u2019s analysis is our opinion \nin Edmond.  There we explained that \u201c[w]hether one is an\n\u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a superior\u201dother than the President.  520 U. S., at 662.

See id., at 658.  We held that the \njudges were inferior officers because they were effectively\nsupervised by a combination of Presidentially nominated and Senate confirmed officers in the Executive Branch: \nfirst, the Judge Advocate Ge neral, who \u201cexercise[d] admin-\nistrative oversight over the Court of Criminal Appeals\u201d by\nprescribing rules of procedure and formulating policies for \ncourt-martial cases, and could also \u201cremove a Court of \nCriminal Appeals judge from his judicial assignment with-\nout cause\u201d; and second, the Court of Appeals for the ArmedForces, an executive tribunal that could review the judges\u2019\ndecisions under a de novo  standard for legal issues and a \ndeferential standard for factual issues.  Id., at 664\u2013665. \n\u201cWhat is significant,\u201d we concluded, \u201cis that the judges of \nthe Court of Criminal Appeals have no power to render a \nfinal decision on behalf of the United States unless permit-\nted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d  Id., at 665. \nCongress structured the PTAB differently, providing only\nhalf of the \u201cdivided\u201d supervision to which judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals were subject.

Id., \nat 665. The only possibility of review is a petition for re-hearing, but Congress unambiguously specified that \u201c[o]nly \nthe Patent and Trial Appeal Board may grant rehearings.\u201d \u00a76(c).

The principal dissent\u2019s observation that \u201ctheDirector alone has the power to ta ke final action to cancel a\npatent claim or confirm it,\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of T\nHOMAS , \nJ.), simply ignores the undisputed fact that the Director\u2019s \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n 11 Cite as: 594 U.

The chain of command runs not from the Direc-tor to his subordinates, but from the APJs to the Director. \nThe Government and Smith & Nephew assemble a cata-\nlog of steps the Director migh t take to affect the deci -\nsionmaking process of the PTAB, despite his lack of any \nstatutory authority to review its decisions.  See Brief for \nUnited States 30\u201332; Brief for Smith & Nephew, Inc., et al. \n25\u201327. The Government reminds us that it is the Director \nwho decides whether to initiate inter partes review. \n\u00a7314(a). The Director can also designate the APJs who will \ndecide a particular case and can pick ones predisposed to \nhis views. \u00a76(c). And the Di rector, the Government asserts, \ncan even vacate his institution decision if he catches wind \nof an unfavorable ruling on the way.  The \u201cproceeding will\nhave no legal consequences\u201d so long as the Director jumps \nin before the Board issues its final decision.  Brief for \nUnited States 31. \nIf all else fails, the Government says, the Director can in-\ntervene in the rehearing process to reverse Board decisions.The Government acknowledges  that only the PTAB can \ngrant rehearing under \u00a76(c).  But the Director, according tothe Government, could manipulate the composition of the PTAB panel that acts on the rehearing petition.  For one \nthing, he could \u201cstack\u201d the orig inal panel to rehear the case \nwith additional APJs assumed to be more amenable to his preferences. See Oil States , 584 U. S., at ___ (G\nORSUCH , J., \ndissenting) (slip op., at 3).  For another, he could assemble \nan entirely new panel consisting of himself and two other \nofficers appointed by the Se cretary\u2014in practice, the Com-\nmissioner for Patents and the APJ presently designated as Chief Judge\u2014to decide whether to overturn a decision and\nreach a different outcome binding on future panels.  See \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nBrief for United States 6\u20137, 31\u201332.  The Government insists \nthat the Director, by handpicking (and, if necessary, re-\npicking) Board members, can indirectly influence the course of inter partes review. \nThat is not the solution.  It is the problem. The Govern-\nment proposes (and the dissents embrace) a roadmap for \nthe Director to evade a statutory prohibition on review\nwithout having him take respon sibility for the ultimate de-\ncision. See post, at 2\u20133 (B\nREYER , J., concurring in judgment \nin part and dissenting in part); post, at 8\u201310 (opinion of \nTHOMAS , J.). Even if the Director succeeds in procuring his\npreferred outcome, such machinations blur the lines of ac-countability demanded by the Appointments Clause. The parties are left with neither an impartial decision by a \npanel of experts nor a transparent decision for which a po-\nlitically accountable officer must take responsibility.  And \nthe public can only wonder \u201con whom the blame or the pun-\nishment of a pernicious measure, or series of perniciousmeasures ought really to fall.\u201d  The Federalist No. 70, at \n476 (A. Hamilton).\nThe Government contends that the Director may respond\nafter the fact by removing an APJ \u201cfrom his judicial assign-\nment without cause\u201d and refusing to designate that APJ on future PTAB panels. Edmond, 520 U. S., at 664.  Even as-\nsuming that is true, reassigning an APJ to a different taskgoing forward gives the Directo r no means of countermand-\ning the final decision already on the books.  Nor are APJs \u201cmeaningfully controlled\u201d by the threat of removal from fed -\neral service entirely, Seila Law , 591 U.

In all the ways that matter to\nthe parties who appear before the PTAB, the buck stops \nwith the APJs, not with the Secretary or Director. \nReview outside Article II\u2014here, an appeal to the Federal \nCircuit\u2014cannot provide the necessary supervision.

S., at 663. \nThe principal dissent dutifully undertakes to apply the\ngoverning test from Edmond, see post, at 5\u201310 (opinion of \nT\nHOMAS , J.), but its heart is plainly not in it.  For example, \nthe dissent rejects any distinction between \u201cinferior-officer\npower\u201d and \u201cprincipal-officer power,\u201d post, at 12, but Ed-\nmond calls for exactly that: an appraisal of how much power \nan officer exercises free from control by a superior.  The dis-\nsent pigeonholes this considerat ion as the sole province of\nthe Vesting Clause, post, at 14\u201315, but Edmond recognized\nthe Appointments Clause as a \u201csignificant structural safe-\nguard[ ]\u201d that \u201cpreserve[s] political accountability\u201d through \ndirection and supervision of subordinates\u2014in other words,\nthrough a chain of command.  520 U.

The \ndissent would have the Court focus on the location of an of-\nficer in the agency \u201corganizational chart,\u201d post, at 1, but as \nwe explained in Edmond , \u201c[i]t is not enough that other of-\nficers may be identified who formally maintain a higher \nrank, or possess responsibilities of a greater magnitude,\u201d \n520 U.

Con-\nspicuously absent from the dissent is any concern for thePresident\u2019s ability to \u201cdischarge  his own constitutional duty \nof seeing that the laws be  faithfully executed.\u201d  Myers  v. \nUnited States, 272 U.

Of course, we have a different view on the \nproper application of Edmond in this dispute. As for other past decisions, it is the dissent that expressly grounds its\nanalysis in dissenting opinions from Free Enterprise Fund \nand Seila Law , while frankly acknowledging that the \nCourt\u2019s  opinions in those cases support the principles that\nguide us here. Post, at 5\u20137. \nC \nHistory reinforces the conclusion that the unreviewable \nexecutive power exercised by APJs is incompatible with their status as inferior officers.  Since the founding, princi-\npal officers have directed the deci sions of inferior officers on\nmatters of law as well as policy.  Hamilton articulated the principle of constitutional accountability underlying suchsupervision in a 1792 Treasury circular. Writing as Secre -\ntary of the Treasury to the customs officials under hischarge, he warned that any deviations from his instructions \n\u201cwould be subversive of uniformity in the execution of the\nlaws.\u201d 3 Works of Alexander Hamilton 557 (J.

See, e.g., 1 Stat. 66\u201367 (authorizing appeal\nof auditor decisions to Comptroller); \u00a74, 1 Stat. 378 (permit-\nting supervisors of the revenue to issue liquor licenses \u201csub-\nject to the superintendence, co ntrol and direction of the de-\npartment of the treasury\u201d). For the most part, Congress leftthe structure of administrative adjudication up to agencyheads, who prescribed internal procedures (and thus exer-\ncised direction and control) as they saw fit.  See J. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution 254 (2012). \nThis Court likewise indicated in early decisions that ade-\nquate supervision entails review of decisions issued by in-ferior officers. For example, we held that the Commissioner \nof the General Land Office\u2014the erstwhile agency that ad-judicated private claims to public lands and granted land\npatents\u2014could review decisions of his subordinates despite \ncongressional silence on the matter.  Our explanation, al -\nmost \u201ctoo manifest to require comment,\u201d was that the au-\nthority to review flowed from the \u201cnecessity of \u2018supervision \nand control,\u2019 vested in the commissioner, acting under the\ndirection of the President.\u201d Barnard  v. Ashley , 18 How. 43, \n45 (1856). \u201cOf necessity,\u201d we later elaborated, the Commis-\nsioner \u201cmust have power to adjudge the question of accu -\nracy preliminary to the issue of a [land] patent.\u201d  Magwire \nv. Tyler , 1 Black 195, 202 (1862). \nCongress has carried the model of principal officer review\ninto the modern administrative  state.  As the Government \nforthrightly acknowledged at oral argument, it \u201ccertainly isthe norm\u201d for principal officers to have the capacity to re -\nview decisions made by inferior adjudicative officers.  Tr. of \nOral Arg. 23.  The Administrative Procedure Act, from its inception, authorized agency heads to review such deci -\nsions. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7557(b).  And \u201chigher-level agency recon-sideration\u201d by the agency head is the standard way to main-tain political accountability and effective oversight for \n16 UNITED STATES  v.

Rev. 141, 157 (2019).  To take one example recently discussed by this Court in Free Enterprise \nFund , the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board can \nissue sanctions in disciplinary proceedings, but such sanc-\ntions are reviewable by its superior, the Securities and Ex-\nchange Commission.  15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77215(c)(4), 7217(c).  The Government and Smith & Nephew point to a handful \nof contemporary officers who are appointed by heads of de-\npartments but who nevertheless purportedly exercise final \ndecisionmaking authority.  Several examples, however, in-volve inferior officers whose decisions a superior executive officer can review or implement a system for reviewing.  For \ninstance, the special trial judges in Freytag  v. Commis-\nsioner , 501 U. S. 868 (1991), may enter a decision on behalf \nof the Tax Court\u2014whose members are nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate, 26 U. S.

And while the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals does make the final \ndecision within the Department of Veterans Affairs, 38 \nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77101, 7104(a), its decisions are reviewed by the Court of Appeals for Veterans  Claims, an Executive Branch \nentity, \u00a7\u00a77251, 7252(a).  See Henderson  v. Shinseki , 562 \nU. S. 428, 431\u2013432 (2011).  Other examples are potentially \ndistinguishable, such as the Benefits Review Board mem-\nbers who appear to serve at the pleasure of the appointing department head.

Congress established both entities in 2006and gave them jurisdiction ov er disputes involving public \ncontractors.  119 Stat. 3391\u20133394. Whatever distinct issues that scheme might present, the Boards of Contract Ap -\npeals\u2014both young entrants to the regulatory landscape\u2014provide the PTAB no \u201cfoothold in history or tradition\u201d across the Executive Branch.  Seila Law , 591 U. S., at ___ \n(slip op., at 21).\nWhen it comes to the patent system in particular, adjudi -\ncation has followed the traditional rule that a principal of -\nficer, if not the President himself, makes the final decision on how to exercise executive po wer.  Recall that officers in \nPresident Washington\u2019s Cabinet formed the first PatentBoard in 1790.  1 Stat. 109\u2013110.  The initial determination \nof patentability was then relega ted to the courts in 1793, \nbut when the Executive Branch reassumed authority in\n1836, it was the Commissioner of Patents\u2014appointed by\nthe President with the advice and consent of the Senate\u2014 \nwho exercised control over the issuance of a patent.  5 Stat. \n117, 119. The patent system, for nearly the next hundred \nyears, remained accountable to the President through theCommissioner, who directed the work of his subordinates \nby, for example, hearing appeals from decisions by examin-\ners-in-chief, the forebears of today\u2019s APJs.  12 Stat. 246\u2013 247. \nThe Government and Smith & Nephew find support for \nthe structure of the PTAB in the predecessor Board of Ap -\npeals established in 1927.  44 Stat. 1335\u20131336. Simplifiedsomewhat, the Board of Appeals decided the patentabilityof inventions in panels composed of examiners-in-chief \nwithout an appeal to the Commissioner.  But decisions by\nexaminers-in-chief could be reviewed by the Court of Cus-\ntoms and Patent Appeals (CCPA), an entity within the Ex -\n  \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  18 UNITED STATES  v.

S. 438, 460 (1929); see also 72 Stat. 848. \nThe President appointed CCPA judges with the advice and\nconsent of the Senate. 36 Stat. 105.  Even after 1958, the \nCommissioner appears to have retained \u201cthe ultimate au-thority regarding the granting of patents\u201d through the ex-\namination and interference processes, notwithstanding the \nlack of a formal appeal from the Board\u2019s decision. In re \nAlappat , 33 F. 3d 1526, 1535 (CA Fed. 1994) (en banc) (plu-\nrality opinion). The history of the Board of Appeals, though more winding and varied than recounted here, has little to\nsay about the present provision expressly ordering the Di-\nrector to undo his prior pate ntability determination when a \nPTAB panel of unaccountable APJs later disagrees with it.See 35 U. S. C. \u00a7318(b).\nThe Government and Smith & Nephew also note that\nearly Patent Acts authorized the Secretary of State to ap-point two types of officials who made final decisions on \nquestions of patent law.  See 1 Stat. 322\u2013323 (panel of arbi-\ntrators in interference proceedings); 5 Stat. 120\u2013121 (board of examiners to hear appeal from patentability or priority \ndecision of Commissioner).  Neither example, however,\nserves as historical precedent for modern APJs.  Both the arbitrators and the examiners as sembled to resolve a single\nissue\u2014indeed, these ad hoc positions may not have even \nconstituted offices.  See Auffmordt  v. Hedden, 137 U.

The prin-\ncipal dissent repeatedly charges that we never say whether APJs are principal officers who were not appointed in the \nmanner required by the Appointments Clause, or instead \ninferior officers exceeding the permissible scope of their du-\nties under that Clause. See post, at 3, 11, 16 (opinion of \nT\nHOMAS , J.).

Here, however, Con-\ngress has assigned APJs \u201csignificant authority\u201d in adjudi-cating the public rights of private parties, while also insu-\nlating their decisions from review and their offices from \nremoval.

Bank of Hamilton  v. Lessee of Dudley , 2 \nPet. 492, 526 (1829) (Marshall, C. J.).  This principle ex-\nplains our \u201cnormal rule that partial, rather than facial, in -\nvalidation is the required course.\u201d Brockett  v. Spokane Ar-\ncades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985). \nArthrex asks us to hold the entire regime of inter partes\nreview unconstitutional.  In its view, any more tailored dec-laration of unconstitutionality would necessitate a policy\ndecision best left to Congress in the first instance.  Because \nthe good cannot be separated from the bad, Arthrex contin-ues, the appropriate remedy is to order outright dismissal \nof the proceeding below. The partial dissent, similarly for-swearing the need to do anything beyond \u201cidentifying the\nconstitutional violation,\u201d would grant full relief to Arthrex. \nPost, at 5\u20136 (G\nORSUCH , J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part).\nIn our view, however, the structure of the PTO and the \ngoverning constitutional princi ples chart a clear course: De-\ncisions by APJs must be subje ct to review by the Director.\nCongress vested the Director with the \u201cpowers and duties\u201dof the PTO, 35 U. S. C. \u00a73(a)(1), tasked him with supervis-\ning APJs, \u00a73(a)(2)(A), and placed the PTAB \u201cin\u201d the PTO,\u00a76(a). A single officer has su perintended the activities of \nthe PTO since the Commissioner of Patents assumed the role of \u201cchief officer\u201d of the Patent Office in 1836.  \u00a71, 5 Stat. \n117\u2013118. The Commissioner long oversaw examiners-in-\nchief, see 12 Stat. 246\u2013247, just as the Director today has the responsibility to oversee APJs.  While shielding the ul-\ntimate decisions of the 200-plus APJs from review, Con-\ngress also provided the Director means of control over the \ninstitution and conduct of inter partes review.  35 U. S. C. \n\u00a7\u00a7314(a), 316(a).  In every respect save the insulation oftheir decisions from review within the Executive Branch, \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   Opinion of the Court 21 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nOpinion of R OBERTS , C. J. \nAPJs appear to be inferior officers\u2014an understanding con-\nsistent with their appointment in a manner permissible for\ninferior but not principal officers. \nThe America Invents Act insulates APJs from supervi-\nsion through two mechanisms. The statute provides that \u201ceach . . . inter partes review shall be heard by at least 3\nmembers of the [PTAB]\u201d and that \u201conly the [PTAB] may\ngrant rehearings.\u201d \u00a76(c). The upshot is that the Director cannot rehear and reverse a final decision issued by APJs. \nIf the Director were to have the \u201cauthority to take control\u201d\nof a PTAB proceeding, APJs would properly function as in-\nferior officers. Go-Bart Importing Co.  v. United States , 282 \nU. S. 344, 354 (1931).\nWe conclude that a tailored approach is the appropriate\none: Section 6(c) cannot consti tutionally be enforced to the\nextent that its requirements prevent the Director from re -\nviewing final decisions rendered by APJs.  Because Con-gress has vested the Director with the \u201cpower and duties\u201dof the PTO, \u00a73(a)(1), the Director has the authority to pro-\nvide for a means of reviewing PTAB decisions.  See also \n\u00a7\u00a73(a)(2)(A), 316(a)(4). The Director accordingly may re-\nview final PTAB decisions and, upon review, may issue de-\ncisions himself on behalf of the Board.  Section 6(c) other-wise remains operative as to the other members of the \nPTAB. \nThis does not result in an incomplete or unworkable stat-\nutory scheme.  Cf. United States  v. Treasury Employees , 513 \nU. S. 454, 479 (1995). To the contrary, review by the Direc-\ntor would follow the almost-unive rsal model of adjudication \nin the Executive Branch, see supra, at 15\u201316, and aligns the \nPTAB with the other  adjudicative body in the PTO, the\nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board, see \u00a7228 of the Trade-\nmark Modernization Act of 2020, 134 Stat. 2209. \nThe Government defends the different approach adopted \nby the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals held unen -\nforceable APJs\u2019 protection against removal except \u201cfor such \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Opinion of the Court 22 UNITED STATES  v.

C. \u00a73(c).\nSee 941 F. 3d, at 1337, 1340.  If the for-cause provision were\nunenforceable, the Secretary could remove APJs at will. \nSee Ex parte Hennen , 13 Pet. 230, 259\u2013260 (1839). The \nGovernment contends that APJs would then be inferior of -\nficers under Free Enterprise Fund.  But regardless whether\nthe Government is correct that  at-will removal by the Sec-\nretary would cure the constituti onal problem, review by the\nDirector better reflects  the structure of supervision within\nthe PTO and the nature of APJs\u2019 duties, for the reasons we have explained. See supra, at 12, 20\u201321. \nIn sum, we hold that 35 U. S. C. \u00a76(c) is unenforceable as \napplied to the Director insofar as it prevents the Director \nfrom reviewing the decisions of the PTAB on his own.  The \nDirector may engage in such review and reach his own de-\ncision. When reviewing such a decision by the Director, a \ncourt must decide the case \u201cco nformably to the constitution, \ndisregarding the law\u201d placing restrictions on his review au-\nthority in violation of Article II.  Marbury  v. Madison, 1 \nCranch 137, 178 (1803). We add that this suit concerns onlythe Director\u2019s ability to supervise APJs in adjudicating pe-\ntitions for inter partes review.  We do not address the Di-\nrector\u2019s supervision over other types of adjudications con-ducted by the PTAB, such as the examination process for which the Director has claimed unilateral authority to issue \na patent. See Reply Brief for Arthrex, Inc. 6. \nWe also conclude that the appropriate remedy is a re-\nmand to the Acting Director fo r him to decide whether to\nrehear the petition filed by Smith & Nephew.  Although the \nAPJs\u2019 appointment by the Secre tary allowed them to law-\nfully adjudicate the petition in the first instance, see Frey-tag, 501 U. S., at 881\u2013882, they lacked the power under theConstitution to finally resolve the matter within the Exec-utive Branch. Under these circumstances, a limited re-mand to the Director provides an adequate opportunity for \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   Opinion of the Court 23 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nOpinion of R OBERTS , C. J. \nreview by a principal officer.  Because the source of the con-\nstitutional violation is the restraint on the review authority\nof the Director, rather than the appointment of APJs by theSecretary, Arthrex is not entitl ed to a hearing before a new \npanel of APJs. Cf. Lucia , 585 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at \n12\u201313). \n* * * \nToday, we reaffirm and apply the rule from Edmond that \nthe exercise of executive power by inferior officers must at \nsome level be subject to the direction and supervision of anofficer nominated by the President and confirmed by theSenate. The Constitution ther efore forbids the enforcement \nof statutory restrictions on the Director that insulate the decisions of APJs from his direction and supervision.  To be clear, the Director need not review every decision of the PTAB. What matters is that the Director have the discre-tion to review decisions rendered by APJs.  In this way, thePresident remains responsible for the exercise of executive power\u2014and through him, the exercise of executive power remains accountable to the people. \nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit is vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n _________________ \n_________________ 1 Cite as: 594 U.

I continue to think this Court\u2019s re-cent decision in Oil States \u2014upsetting this traditional un-\nderstanding and allowing officials in the Executive Branchto \u201ccancel\u201d already-issued patents\u2014departed from the Con-\nstitution\u2019s separation of powers. But it would be an even \ngreater departure to permit th ose officials to withdraw a \nvested property right while accountable to no one within the \nExecutive Branch. Accordingly, I join Parts I and II of the \n2 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \n  \nOpinion of  GORSUCH , J. \n Court\u2019s opinion.  Respectfully, however, I am unable to join \nthe Court\u2019s severability discussion in Part III. \n* \n On the merits, I agree with the Court that Article II vests \nthe \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President alone.  This admit-\ntedly formal rule serves a vital function.

Without pres-\nidential responsibility there can be no democratic account-\nability for executive action.  Of course, the framers recognized that no one alone can \ndischarge all the executive duties of the federal govern-\nment.

But the framers took \npains to ensure those subordinates would always remain responsible to the President and thus, ultimately, to the \npeople.  Because it is the Presid ent\u2019s duty to take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed, Art.

Several constitutional  provisions reflect this struc-\nture.  See Calabresi & Prakash, The President\u2019s Power To \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 Cite as: 594 U.

In the America \nInvents Act of 2011 (AIA), Congress authorized the inter \npartes review (IPR) process, which permits anyone to file a \npetition asking the Patent and Trademark Office to \u201ccancel\u201d someone else\u2019s patent.  35 U. S. C. \u00a7311.  Congress assigned\nthe power to decide an IPR proceeding to a specific group of\nofficials\u2014the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).

After the \nthree-member panel issues its decision, a party may seek rehearing from another three-member panel. Ibid.  B u t \nonly a PTAB panel\u2014and no other official within the Execu-tive Branch\u2014may grant rehearing.  Ibid.  If that fails, a \nlosing party\u2019s only recourse is to seek judicial review in the Court of Appeals for the Fede ral Circuit, which reviews the \nPTAB\u2019s factual findings under the deferential substantial\nevidence standard of review. See \u00a7319; Oil States , 584 \nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nUnder this statutory arrangem ent, APJs are executive of-\nficers accountable to no one else in the Executive Branch. A panel of bureaucrats wields unreviewable power to take \nvested property rights.  This design may hold its ad-vantages for some.  Often enou gh, the Director of the Patent \nand Trademark Office and the President may be happy towash their hands of these decisions.  But by breaking the\nchain of dependence, the statutory scheme denies individu -\nals the right to be subjected only to lawful  exercises of ex -\necutive power that can ultimately be controlled by a Presi-dent accountable to \u201cthe supreme body, namely, . . . the \npeople.\u201d \n* \nThe real question here concerns what to do about it.

Sometimes Congress includes \u201cfallback\u201d\nprovisions of just this sort, and sometimes those provisionstell us to disregard this or t hat provision if its statutory\nscheme is later found to offe nd the Constitution.  See, e.g., \nBowsher v. Synar , 478 U. S. 714, 718\u2013719 (1986); see also\nWalsh, Partial Unconstitutionality, 85 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 738,780\u2013781 (2010).\nThe problem here is that Congress has said nothing of the \nsort. And here it is the combination of separate statutoryprovisions that conspire to creat e a constitutional violation. \nThrough some provisions, Co ngress has authorized execu-\ntive officers to cancel patents. \u00a7\u00a76(b)(4), 318(a). Throughothers, it has made their exe rcise of that power unreviewa-\nble within the Executive Branch. See \u00a7\u00a76(c), 318(b). It\u2019s \nthe combination of these provisions\u2014the exercise of execu-\ntive power and unreviewability\u2014 that violates the Consti-\ntution\u2019s separation of powers.\nNor is there only one possible way out of the problem. \nFirst, one could choose as the Court does and make PTAB \ndecisions subject to review by the Director, who is answer-\nable to the President through a chain of dependence.  See \nDuffy, Are Administrative Patent Judges Unconstitu -\ntional? 77 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 904, 911 (2009).  Separately,\none could specify that PTAB panel members should be ap -\npointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate and render their decisions directly reviewable by the President. \nSee Lawson, 26 Geo. Mason L. Rev., at 57.  Separately still, one could reassign the power to cancel patents to the Judi-\nciary where it resided for nearly two centuries.  See Oil \nStates, 584 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (G\nORSUCH , J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 8\u201310).  Without some direction from Congress, this\nproblem cannot be resolved as a matter of statutory inter-\npretation. All that remains is a policy choice. \nIn circumstances like these, I believe traditional remedial \nprinciples should be our guide. Early American courts did \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of GORSUCH , J. \nnot presume a power to \u201csever\u201d and excise portions of stat-\nutes in response to constitutional violations. Instead, when \nthe application of a statute violated the Constitution, courtssimply declined to enforce the statute in the case or contro-\nversy at hand. See Seila Law , 591 U. S., at ___ (T\nHOMAS , \nJ., dissenting in part) (slip op., at 15); see also Walsh, N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 769.  I would follow that course today by \nidentifying the constitutional violation, explaining our rea-\nsoning, and \u201csetting aside\u201d the PTAB decision in this case.See Novartis AG v. Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , 853 F. 3d \n1316, 1323\u20131324 (CA Fed. 2017) (holding that the standard in 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706 governs judicial review of PTAB deci-\nsions).\nThe Court declines to follow this traditional path.  In -\nstead, it imagines that, if Co ngress had known its statutory \nscheme was unconstitutional, it would have preferred to \nmake the policy choice the Cou rt makes for it today.  Faced \nwith an unconstitutional combination of statutory instruc-\ntions\u2014providing for the exercise  of executive power and its \nunreviewability\u2014the Court chooses  to act as if the provision\nlimiting the Director\u2019s ability to review IPR decisions \ndoesn\u2019t exist. Having done that, the Court gifts the Director\na new power that he never befo re enjoyed, a power Congress \nexpressly withheld from him and gave to someone else\u2014the\npower to cancel patents through the IPR process. Effec -\ntively, the Court subtracts statutory powers from one set ofexecutive officials and adds them to another. \nWhile the Court has in relatively recent years proclaimed \nthe power to proceed in this fashion, it has never paused toexplain how this \u201cseverance doctrine\u201d comports with tradi -\ntional judicial remedi al principles.  See Barr v. American \nAssn. of Political Consultants , Inc., 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) \n(G\nORSUCH , J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent-\ning in part) (slip op., at 5).

Rev. 933, 954\u2013960 (2018).  Let alone with our con-\nstant admonitions that policy choices belong to Congress, \nnot this Court. E.g., Pereida v. Wilkinson, 592 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2021) (slip op., at 16). And certainly none of the early cases \nthe Court cites today proceeded as it does.  See ante, at 19, \n22. \nNor does the Court pause to consider whether venturing\nfurther down this remedial path today risks underminingthe very separation of powers its merits decision purports to vindicate. While the Court\u2019s merits analysis ensures that \nexecutive power properly resides in the Executive Branch, \nits severability analysis seemingly confers legislative power \nto the Judiciary\u2014endowing us with the authority to make\na raw policy choice between competing lawful options.  No doubt, if Congress is dissatisfied with the choice the Court\nmakes on its behalf today, it can always reenter the field \nand revise our judgment.  But doesn\u2019t that just underscore\nthe legislative nature of the Court\u2019s judgment?  And doesn\u2019t \ndeciding for ourselves which policy course to pursue todayallow Congress to disclaim responsibility for our legislative \nhandiwork much as the President might the PTAB\u2019s execu-\ntive decisions under the current statutory structure?\nInstead of confronting these questions, the Court has jus -\ntified modern \u201cseverance\u201d doctrine on assumptions and pre-sumptions about what Congress would have chosen to do, \nhad it known that its stat utory scheme was unconstitu-\ntional. See, e.g., Seila Law , 591 U.

Two related consid-\nerations also persuade me that his conclusion is correct. \nFirst , in my view, the Court should interpret the Appoint-\nments Clause as granting Congress a degree of leeway to \nestablish and empower federal o ffices.  Neither that Clause \nnor anything else in the Constitution describes the degree\nof control that a superior offi cer must exercise over the de-\ncisions of an inferior officer.  To the contrary, the Constitu-tion says only that \u201cCongress may by Law vest the Appoint-\nment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, . . . in \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  BREYER ,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part2 UNITED STATES  v.

The words \u201cby \nLaw . . . as they think proper\u201d strongly suggest that Con -\ngress has considerable freedom to determine the nature of \nan inferior officer\u2019s job, and that  courts ought to respect that\njudgment. See Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) \n(BREYER , J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting \nin part) (slip op., at 9\u201310).  In a word, the Constitution grants to Congress the \u201cauthority to create both categories of offices\u2014those the President must fill with the Senate\u2019s \nconcurrence and \u2018inferior\u2019 ones. . . . That constitutional as-\nsignment to Congress counsel s judicial deference.\u201d  In re \nSealed Case , 838 F. 2d 476, 532 (CADC) (R. Ginsburg, J.,\ndissenting), rev\u2019d  sub nom. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 \n(1988). Article I\u2019s grant to Congress of broad authority to enact laws of different kinds concerning different subjects\u2014\nand to implement those laws in ways that Congress deter-\nmines are \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d\u2014suggests the same.  Art. \nI, \u00a78, cl. 18.\nEven a small degree of \u201cjudic ial deference\u201d should prove\nsufficient to validate the statutes here. For one, the provi-sions at issue fall well within Article I\u2019s grant to Congress \nof the patent power. Nothing in them represents an effort\nby the \u201cLegislative Branch [to]  aggrandize itself at the ex-\npense of the other two branches.\u201d  Buckley  v. Valeo , 424 \nU.

Even were I to assume, with the majority, that the \nDirector must have power to \u201cco ntrol\u201d the APJs, the stat-\nutes grant the Director considerable control.  As the Court \nrecognizes, the Director \u201cfixes\u201d their \u201crate[s] of pay,\u201d decides\n\u201cwhether to institute inter partes review,\u201d \u201cselects the APJ\u2019s\u201d who will preside at each particular proceeding, \n\u201cpromulgates regulations gove rning inter partes review,\u201d\n\u201cissues prospective guidance on patentability issues,\u201d and \n\u201cdesignates past PTAB decisions as \u2018precedential\u2019 for future\npanels.\u201d Ante,  at 10.  All told, the Director maintains con-\ntrol of decisions insofar as they determine policy.  The Di-rector cannot rehear and decide  an individual case on his \nown; but Congress had good reason for seeking independent \nBoard determinations in those cases\u2014cases that will apply, \nnot create, Director- controlled policy.\nFinally, Congress\u2019 judgment is unusually clear in this\nsuit, as there is strong evidence that Congress designed the\ncurrent structure specifically to address constitutional con-\ncerns. See In re DBC , 545 F. 3d 1373, 1377\u20131380 (CA Fed. \n2008) (explaining amendment to address defects in prior appointment process). \nSecond, I believe the Court, when deciding cases such as \nthese, should conduct a functional examination of the of -\nfices and duties in question rather than a formalist, judi-\ncial-rules-based approach.  In advocating for a \u201cfunctional \napproach,\u201d I mean an approach that would take account of, \nand place weight on, why Congress enacted a particular \nstatutory limitation. It would also consider the practicalconsequences that are likely to follow from Congress\u2019 cho-\nsen scheme. \nWiener  v. United States , 357 U. S. 349 (1958), provides a \ngood example of the role that purposes and consequences \ncan play. In that case, the Court considered whether, in the \nface of congressional silence on the matter, the President\nhad the constitutional or statutory authority to remove without cause a member of the War Claims Commission. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  BREYER ,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part4 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of B REYER , J. \nJustice Frankfurter, writing for a unanimous Court, said\nthat Congress sought to create a commission that was \u201c \u2018en-\ntirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or \nindirect,\u2019 of either the Executive or the Congress.\u201d  Id., at \n355\u2013356 (quoting Humphrey\u2019s Executor  v. United States, \n295 U. S. 602, 629 (1935)).  He then asked why Congressmight want to deny the Pres ident the power to remove a \ncommissioner.  Because, he answ ered, the \u201cintrinsic judicial \ncharacter\u201d of the Commission\u2019s duties required that it beable to adjudicate claims solely on the merits of each claim\nfree of external executive pressu re.  357 U. S., at 355.  \u201cCon-\ngress did not wish to have hang over the Commission the Damocles\u2019 sword of removal by the President for no reasonother than that he preferred to have on that Commission\nmen of his own choosing.\u201d  Id., at 356. The Court has sub-\nsequently used the functional approach reflected in Wiener \nto resolve all manner of separation-of-powers disputes, in -\ncluding disputes under the Appointments Clause.  See, e.g., \nBuckley , 424 U. S., at 126 (distinguishing employees from\nofficers by asking if the indi vidual exercises \u201csignificant au-\nthority\u201d); Mistretta  v. United States , 488 U. S. 361, 409 \n(1989) (asking whether a statute \u201cprevents the JudicialBranch from performing its constitutionally assigned func-\ntions\u201d).\nIn this suit, a functional approach, which considers pur-\nposes and consequences, undermines the Court\u2019s result.\nMost agencies (and courts for that matter) have the powerto reconsider an earlier decision, changing the initial result\nif appropriate. Congress beli eved that the PTO should have\nthat same power and accordingly created procedures for re-considering issued patents. Congress also believed it im-\nportant to strengthen the reconsideration power with pro-cedural safeguards that would often help those whom the\nPTO\u2019s initial decision had favo red, such as the requirement\nthat review be available only  when there is a \u201creasonable \nlikelihood\u201d that the patent will be invalid.  35 U.

Given the technical nature of patents, the need for\nexpertise, and the importance of avoiding political interfer-\nence, Congress chose to grant the APJs a degree of inde -\npendence. These considerations set forth a reasonable leg-islative objective sufficient to  justify the restriction upon \nthe Director\u2019s authority that Congress imposed.  And, as J\nUSTICE THOMAS  thoroughly explains, there is no reason to \nbelieve this scheme will prev ent the Director from exercis-\ning policy control over the APJs or will break the chain of accountability that is needed to hold the President respon-\nsible for bad nominations.  Post , at 7\u201310 (dissenting opin -\nion).\nThe Court does not take these realities into account.  In-\nstead, for the first time, it examines the APJs\u2019 office func-\ntion by function and finds, in Edmond, a judicially created\nrule: \u201cOnly an officer properly ap pointed to a principal office \nmay issue a final decision binding the Executive Branch in\n[inter partes review] proceeding[s].\u201d  Ante,  at 19.  As an in -\nitial matter, I agree with J\nUSTICE THOMAS  that this rule \nhas no foundation in Edmond or our Appointments Clause\nprecedents. Post, at 10\u201311. \nMore broadly, I see the Court\u2019s decision as one part of a \nlarger shift in our separation-of-powers jurisprudence.  The \nCourt applied a similarly formal approach in Free Enter-\nprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd. , \n561 U. S. 477 (2010), where it considered the constitutional \nstatus of the members of an accounting board appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It held that Con-\ngress could not limit the SEC\u2019 s power to remove those mem-\nbers without cause. The Court also applied a formalist ap-proach in Seila Law LLC  v. Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau , 591 U. S. ___ (2020), where it held that Congress \ncould not protect from removal without cause the (single) \nhead of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. My dis-sent in the first case and J\nUSTICE KAGAN \u2019s dissent in the \nsecond explain in greater detail why we believed that this \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  BREYER ,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part6 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nOpinion of B REYER , J. \nshift toward formalism was a mistake. \nI continue to believe that a more functional approach to\nconstitutional interpretation in this area is superior.  As for \nthis particular suit, the conseque nces of the majority\u2019s rule\nare clear. The nature of the PTAB calls for technically cor-\nrect adjudicatory decisions.  And, as in Wiener , that fact \ncalls for greater, not less, independence from those poten-tially influenced by political factors.  The Court\u2019s decision prevents Congress from establishing a patent scheme con-\nsistent with that idea. \nBut there are further reasons for a functional approach\nthat extend beyond the bounds of patent adjudication.\nFirst, the Executive Branch has many different constituentbodies, many different bureaus, many different agencies, \nmany different tasks, many different kinds of employees.\nAdministration comes in many different shapes and sizes.\nAppreciating this variety is especially important in the con-\ntext of administrative adjudication, which typically de-mands decisionmaking (at least where policy made by oth-\ners is simply applied) that is fr ee of political influence. Are \nthe President and Congress, through judicial insistenceupon certain mechanisms for removal or review, to be de-\nnied the ability to create independent adjudicators?\nSecond, the Constitution is  not a detailed tax code, and \nfor good reason. The Nation\u2019s desires and needs change, sometimes over long periods of time.  In the 19th century the Judiciary may not have foreseen the changes that pro-\nduced the New Deal, along with its accompanying changes \nin the nature of the tasks that Government was expected to\nperform. We may not now easily foresee just what kinds of\ntasks present or future technological changes will call for.The Founders wrote a Constitution that they believed was \nflexible enough to respond to new needs as those needs de-\nveloped and changed over the course of decades or centu-\nries. At the same time, they designed a Constitution that \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  BREYER ,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part7 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nOpinion of B REYER , J. \nwould protect certain basic principles.  A principle that pre-vents Congress from affording inferior level adjudicators\nsome decisionmaking independence was not among them. \nFinally, the Executive Branch and Congress are more \nlikely than are judges to understand how to implement thetasks that Congress has written into legislation.  That un-\nderstanding encompasses the nature of different mecha-\nnisms of bureaucratic control that may apply to the manythousands of administrators who will carry out those tasks.\nAnd it includes an awareness of the reasonable limits that \ncan be placed on supervisors to ensure that those working under them enjoy a degree of freedom sufficient to carry out \ntheir responsibilities.  Considered as a group, unelected \njudges have little, if any, experience related to this kind of\na problem.\nThis is not to say that the Constitution grants Congress\nfree rein. But in this area of the law a functional approach,when compared with the highly detailed judicial-rules-\nbased approach reflected in the Court\u2019s decision, is more\nlikely to prevent inappropriate judicial interference.  It em -\nbodies, at least to a degree, the philosopher\u2019s advice: \n\u201cWhereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\u201d \nII \nFor the reasons I have set forth above, I do not agree with\nthe Court\u2019s basic constitutio nal determination.  For pur-\nposes of determining a remedy, however, I recognize that a majority of the Court has reac hed a contrary conclusion.\nOn this score, I believe that any remedy should be tailoredto the constitutional violation.  Under the Court\u2019s new test, \nthe current statutory scheme is defective only because the APJ\u2019s decisions are not reviewable by the Director alone. The Court\u2019s remedy addresses t hat specific problem, and for \nthat reason I agree with its remedial holding. \n  \n  \n   BREYER ,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part8 UNITED STATES  v.

At the top sits the President, in whom the executive power is\nvested. U. S. Const., Art. II, \u00a71.  Below him is the Secretary\nof Commerce, who oversees the Department of Commerce\nand its work force of about 46,000. 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71501, 1513.\nWithin that Department is the United States Patent andTrademark Office led by a Director.  35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71, 2(a), \n3(a) (also known as the Under Secretary of Commerce for\nIntellectual Property). In th e Patent and Trademark Office \nis the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. \u00a76(a).  Serving on\nthis Board are administrative patent judges.  Ibid. \nThere are few statutory prer equisites to becoming an ad-\nministrative patent judge.  One must be a \u201cperso[n] of com-\npetent legal knowledge and scientific ability\u201d and be \u201cap-\npointed by the Secretary.\u201d Ibid. The job description too is\nrelatively straightforward: si t on the Board along with the\nDirector, the Deputy Director, the Commissioner for Pa-tents, the Commissioner for Trademarks, and other admin-\nistrative patent judges. Ibid. \nThe Board adjudicates both appellate and trial disputes.\nSee \u00a76(b). It may directly re view certain decisions made by\npatent examiners, and it may hold its own proceedings to\ndetermine the patentability of patent claims. As relevant \nhere, it conducts inter partes review, which \u201coffers a second\nlook at an earlier administrative grant of a patent.\u201d  Cuozzo \nSpeed Technologies,  LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. 261, 279 (2016).\nInter partes review\u2014and all other types of Board hear-ings\u2014must be \u201cheard by at least 3 members\u201d of the Board.\u00a76(c).\nIn this suit, Smith & Nephew, Inc., and Arthrocare Corp.\n(collectively, Smith & Nephew) filed a petition challenging \nsome of Arthrex, Inc.\u2019s patent  claims.  After deciding that \nthere was a reasonable likelihood that Smith & Nephew \nwould prevail, the Director instituted review.  \u00a7314(a).

S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \npanel of three administrative judges ultimately agreed with\nSmith & Nephew that the disputed claims were unpatent-\nable. The Director did not conv ene a panel to rehear that \ndecision. Nor is there any suggestion that Arthrex sought\nrehearing from the Board or from the Director.  Instead, Ar -\nthrex appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. \nOn appeal, Arthrex argued that the Federal Circuit must\nvacate the Board\u2019s decision.  According to Arthrex, admin-\nistrative patent judges are co nstitutionally defective be-\ncause they are principal officers who were neither ap-\npointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate.  The \nFederal Circuit agreed in part. The court held that admin-\nistrative patent judges are principal officers. 941 F. 3d \n1320, 1335 (2019).  But the court professed to transform these principal officers into inferior ones by withdrawing\nstatutory removal restrictions.  Id., at 1338. \nThe Court now partially agrees with the Federal Circuit.\nAlthough it cannot quite bring itself to say so expressly, it too appears to hold that administrative patent judges are \nprincipal officers under the cu rrent statutory scheme.  See \nante, at 10\u201314.  But it concludes that the better way to ju-\ndicially convert these principal o fficers to inferior ones is to\nallow the Director to review Board decisions unilaterally. \nAnte , at 21 (plurality opinion); ante, at 7 (B\nREYER , J., con-\ncurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThat both the Federal Circuit and this Court would take \nso much care to ensure that administrative patent judges, appointed as inferior officers, would remain inferior officers \nat the end of the day suggests that perhaps they were infe-rior officers to begin with. Instead of rewriting the Direc-\ntor\u2019s statutory powers, I would simply leave intact the pa-tent scheme Congress has created. \nII \nThe Constitution creates a default process to appoint all \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n 4 UNITED STATES  v.

But Con-\ngress has discretion to change the default process for \u201cinfe-\nrior\u201d officers: \u201cCongress may by Law vest the Appointment\nof such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the Presi-\ndent alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-ments.\u201d Ibid. \nA \nThe Court has been careful not to create a rigid test to\ndivide principal officers\u2014those who must be Senate con-firmed\u2014from inferior ones.  See,  e.g., Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U. S. 651, 661 (1997) (the Court has \u201cnot set \nforth an exclusive criterion\u201d); Morrison v. Olson,  487 U. S. \n654, 671 (1988) (\u201cWe need not attempt here to decide ex-actly where the line falls between the two types of officers\u201d).\nInstead, the Court\u2019s opinions have traditionally used a case-\nby-case analysis.

There, we evaluated the sta-\ntus of civilian judges on the Coast Guard Court of Criminal \nAppeals who were appointed by the Secretary of Transpor-\ntation. As in all previous decisions, the Court in Edmond \nheld that the Secretary\u2019s appointment of the judges com-\nplied with the Appointments Clause. \nRecognizing that no \u201cdefinitive test\u201d existed for distin-\nguishing between inferior and principal officers, the Court\nset out two general guidelines. 520 U. S., at 661\u2013662.  First, there is a formal, definitional requirement. The officer \nmust be lower in rank to \u201ca superior.\u201d  Id., at 662. But ac -\ncording to the Court in Edmond, formal inferiority is \u201cnot enough.\u201d Ibid.  So the Court imposed a functional require-\nment: The inferior officer\u2019s work must be \u201cdirected and su-pervised at some level by ot hers who were appointed by \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \njudge or arbitrator in such differences as may arise between the captainsand crews of any vessels belonging to the nations whose interests are \ncommitted to his charge\u201d; \u201cinstitut[in g] prosecutions\u201d and who enjoys \u201cto \na certain extent, independen[ce] in th eir statutory and judicial action,\u201d \nUnited States v.

ARTHREX, INC. \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nPresidential nomination with advice and consent of the \nSenate.\u201d Id., at 663. Because neither side asks us to over-\nrule our precedent, I would apply this two-part guide.\nThere can be no dispute that administrative patent\njudges are, in fact, inferior: They are lower in rank to at \nleast two different officers. As part of the Board, they serve \nin the Patent and Trademark Office, run by a Director \u201cre -\nsponsible for providing policy direction and managementsupervision for the Office and for the issuance of patents\nand the registration of trademarks.\u201d  35 U. S. C. \u00a73(a)(2)(A).\nThat Office, in turn, is \u201c[w]ithin the Department of Com-\nmerce\u201d and \u201csubject to the policy direction of the Secretary\nof Commerce.\u201d  \u00a71(a). The Secretary, in consultation withthe Director, appoints administrative patent judges.  \u00a76(a).\nAs a comparison to the facts in Edmond  illustrates, the \nDirector and Secretary are also functionally superior be-\ncause they supervise and direct the work administrative pa-\ntent judges perform.  In Edmond, the Court focused on the \nsupervision exercised by two different entities: the Judge Advocate General and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). The Judge Advo cate General exercised gen-\neral administrative oversight over the court on which the military judges sat. Edmond, 520 U. S., at 664.  He pos-\nsessed the power to prescribe uniform rules of procedure for the court and to formulate policies and procedure with re -\nspect to the review of court-martial cases in general.  Ibid. \nAnd he could remove a Court of Criminal Appeals judge \nfrom his judicial assignment without cause, a \u201cpowerful tool \nfor control.\u201d Ibid. \nThe Court noted, however, that \u201c[t]he Judge Advocate\nGeneral\u2019s control over Court of Criminal Appeals judges is \n. . . not complete.\u201d Ibid.  This was so for two reasons. He \ncould \u201cnot attempt to influence (by threat of removal or oth-\nerwise) the outcome of individual proceedings.\u201d  Ibid.  And, \nhe had \u201cno power to reverse decisions of the court.\u201d  Ibid. \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nBut this lack of complete co ntrol did not render the mili-\ntary judges principal officers.  That is because one of the \ntwo missing powers resided, to  a limited degree, in a differ-\nent entity: the CAAF. Ibid.  CAAF could not \u201creevaluate \nthe facts\u201d where \u201cthere [was] some competent evidence in \nthe record to establish each element of the offense beyond a \nreasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 665. Still, it was \u201csignificant . . .\nthat the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals ha[d] no\npower to render a final decision on behalf of the United\nStates unless permitted to do so by other Executive offic-\ners.\u201d Ibid. Having recounted the various means of super-\nvision, the Court held that the military judges were inferior \nofficers. Consistent with the Constitution, Congress had \nthe power to vest the judges\u2019 appointments in the Secretary\nof Transportation. Id., at 665\u2013666. \nThe Director here possesses even greater functional \npower over the Board than that possessed by the Judge Ad-\nvocate General. Like the Jud ge Advocate General, the Di-\nrector exercises administrative oversight over the Board. \nBecause the Board is within the Patent and Trademark Of-fice, all of its powers and duties are ultimately held by the \nDirector. 35 U. S. C. \u00a73(a)(1).  He \u201cdirect[s]\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvis[es]\u201d the Office and \u201cthe issuance of patents.\u201d  \u00a73(a)(2)(A).\nHe may even \u201cfix the rate of basic pay for the administrative\npatent judges.\u201d  \u00a73(b)(6). And ultimately, after the Boardhas reached a decision in a specific case, the Director alone\nhas the power to take final acti on to cancel a patent claim \nor confirm it. \u00a7318(b).\nAlso like the Judge Advocate General in Edmond , the Di-\nrector prescribes uniform proced ural rules and formulates\npolicies and procedures for Board proceedings.  Amongother things, he has issued de tailed regulations that govern\n\u201cTrial Practice and Procedure\u201d before the Board. 37 CFR pt. 42 (2020); see also ibid . (prescribing regulations govern-\ning, inter alia , discovery, oral argument, termination of \ntrial, notice, privilege, filing fees, etc.); see also 35 U. S.

He has designed a process to\ndesignate and de-designate Board decisions as preceden-\ntial. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, Standard Operating Procedure 2 (Revision 10), pp. 1\u20132 (Sept. 20, 2018) (SOP2).\nHe may issue binding policy directives that govern the \nBoard. \u00a73(a)(2)(A). And he may release \u201cinstructions that \ninclude exemplary applications of patent laws to fact pat-\nterns, which the Board can refer to when presented with factually similar cases.\u201d  941 F. 3d, at 1331.  His oversight\nis not just administrative; it is substantive as well.\n\u00a73(a)(2)(A).\nThe Director has yet another \u201cpowerful tool for control.\u201d \nEdmond, 520 U. S., at 664. He may designate which of the 250-plus administrative patent judges hear certain cases\nand may remove administrative  patent judges from their \nspecific assignments without cause.  See \u00a76(c). So, if anyadministrative patent judges depart from the Director\u2019s di-\nrection, he has ample power to rein them in to avoid erro-\nneous decisions. And, if an administrative patent judge\nconsistently fails to follow instructions, the Secretary has\nthe authority to fire him. 5 U. S. C. \u00a77513(a); 35 U. S. C. \n\u00a73(c); Cobert v.

Alternatively, he can avoid as-signing any administrative patent judge to a specific dis-\npute and instead designate himself, his Deputy Director, \nand the Commissioner of Patents. In addition, the Director \ndecides which of the thousands of decisions issued each year \nbind other panels as precedent. SOP2, at 8. No statute bars \nthe Director from taking an active  role to ensure the Board\u2019s \ndecisions conform to his policy direction.\nBut, that is not all.

So even if all administrative patent \njudges decide to defy the Di rector\u2019s authority and go their\nrespective ways, the Director and the Commissioner for Pa-\ntents can still put a stop to it.

Traditionally, the Court\u2019s task when resolv-\ning Appointments Clause challenges has been to discern \nwhether the challenged official qualifies as a specific sort of \nofficer and whether his appointment complies with the Con-stitution. See Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip \nop., at 1) (\u201cThis case requires us to decide whether admin-istrative law judges . . . qualify as [officers of the United \nStates]\u201d). If the official\u2019s appointment is inconsistent with \nthe constitutional appointment process for the position he holds, then the Court provides a remedy.  Id., at ___ (slip \nop., at 12). Otherwise, the Court must conclude that the \u201cappointments at issue in th[e] case are . . . valid.\u201d Ed-\nmond, 520 U. S., at 666. \nToday\u2019s majority leaves that tried-and-true approach be-\nhind. It never expressly tells us whether administrative patent judges are inferior officers or principal.  And the Court never tells us whether the appointment process com -\nplies with the Constitution. The closest the Court comes is to say that \u201cthe source of th e constitutional violation\u201d is not \n\u201cthe appointment of [administrative patent judges] by theSecretary.\u201d  Ante , at 23 (plurality opinion).  Under our prec-\nedent and the Constitution\u2019s text, that should resolve the suit. If the appointment process for administrative patentjudges\u2014appointment by the Secretary\u2014does not violate \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nthe Constitution, then administrative patent judges must\nbe inferior officers. See Art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. And if administra-\ntive patent judges are inferior officers and have been properly appointed as such, then the Appointments Clause \nchallenge fails. After all, the Constitution provides that\n\u201cCongress may by Law vest the Appointment of . . . inferior \nOfficers . . . in the Heads of Departments.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe majority\u2019s new Appointments Clause doctrine,\nthough, has nothing to do with the validity of an officer\u2019s\nappointment. Instead, it polices the dispersion of executive \npower among officers.  Echoin g our doctrine that Congress\nmay not mix duties and powers from different branches intoone actor, the Court finds that the constitutional problem here is that Congress has given a specific power\u2014the au-\nthority to finally adjudicate inter partes review disputes\u2014\nto one type of executive officer that the Constitution gives to another. See ante, at 21 (plurality opinion); see also, e.g., \nStern v. Marshall , 564 U. S. 462, 503 (2011) (assignment of \nArticle III power to Bankruptcy Judge); Bowsher v. Synar , \n478 U. S. 714, 728\u2013735 (1986) (assignment of executive \npower to a legislative officer) .  That analysis is doubly \nflawed. \nFor one thing, our separation-of-powers analysis does not \nfit. The Constitution recognizes executive, legislative, and judicial power, and it vests those powers in specific branches. Nowhere does the Constitution acknowledge any \nsuch thing as \u201cinferior-office r power\u201d or \u201cprincipal-officer \npower.\u201d And it certainly does not distinguish between these sorts of powers in the Appointments Clause.\nAnd even if it did, early patent dispute schemes establish \nthat the power exercised by the administrative patentjudges here does not belong excl usively to principal officers. \nNonprincipal officers could\u2014and did\u2014render final deci-sions in specific patent disputes, not subject to any appeal \nto a superior executive office r.

In 1836, Congress al-lowed applicants to appeal the denial of a patent applica-\ntion to \u201ca board of examiners, to be composed of three dis-interested persons, who shall be appointed for that purpose \nby the Secretary of State.\u201d  Act of July 4, 1836, \u00a77, 5 Stat. \n119\u2013120. The Board had the power \u201cto reverse the decision of the Commissioner, either in whole or in part,\u201d and the \ndecision governed \u201cfurther proceedings.\u201d  Ibid.   These two \nearly examples show, at a minimum, that the final resolu-tion of patent disputes is not the sole preserve of principal \nofficers. \nMore broadly, interpreting the Appointments Clause to \nbar any nonprincipal officer from taking \u201cfinal\u201d action poses serious line-drawing problems.  The majority assures that\nnot every decision by an inferior officer must be reviewable \nby a superior officer.  Ante , at 19.  But this sparks more \nquestions than it answers.  Can a line prosecutor offer aplea deal without sign o ff from a principal officer?\n4 If faced \nwith a life-threatening scenario, can an FBI agent use \ndeadly force to subdue a suspect? Or if an inferior officer \ntemporarily fills a vacant office tasked with making final \ndecisions, do those decisions violate the Appointments \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n4And all this contemplates that it is easy to distinguish between a\nprincipal and inferior officer.  Bu t recall that the default appointment \nscheme for all officers\u2014inferior and principal alike\u2014is Presidential ap-\npointment and Senate confirmation.  Senate confirmation says nothing\nabout whether an officer is principal or inferior for constitutional pur-\nposes.  Cf. 2 Opinion of Office of Legal Counsel 58, 59 (1978) (concluding\nthat United States Attorneys \u201ccan be considered to be inferior officers,\u201d \neven though Congress has never \u201cexe rcised its discretionary power to \nvest the appointment of U.

What happens if an officer typically en -\ngages in normal inferior-office r work but also has several \nprincipal-officer duties? Is he a hybrid officer, properly ap -\npointed for four days a week and improperly appointed for the fifth? And whatever test the Court ultimately comes up \nwith to sort through these diffi cult questions, are we sure it\nis encapsulated in the two words \u201cinferior officer\u201d? \nD \nThe majority offers one last theory. Although the parties\nraise only an Appointments Clause challenge and the plu-rality concedes that there is no appointment defect, ante,  at \n23, the Court appears to suggest that the real issue is that \nthis scheme violates the Vesting Clause.  See Art. II, \u00a71, \ncl.1; see also a nte, at 13\u201314 (citing Free Enterprise Fund v. \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd. , 561 U. S. 477, \n496 (2010)); Myers v. United States , 272 U.

Given that this Court is gen-\nerally one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d it is unclear why we would grant relief on this ground.  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 \nU. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). \nSecond, the idea that administrative patent judges are at\nthe top of the chain of command is belied not only by the \nstatutory scheme, see supra,  at 7\u201310, but also by the major-\nity\u2019s own refusal to ever name these judges principal offic-\ners. See ante,  at 19. \nThird, even if the chain of command were broken, Senate \nconfirmation of an administrative patent judge would offer \nno fix. As Madison explained, the Senate\u2019s role in appoint-\nments is an exception to the vesting of executive power in\nthe President; it gives another branch a say in the hiring of executive officials.  1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789).  An Article II Vesting Clause problem cannot be remedied by stripping \naway even more power from the Executive. \nFourth, and finally, historical practice establishes that \nthe vesting of executive power in the President did not re-\nquire that every patent decision be appealable to a principal officer. As the majority correctly explains, these sorts of fi-\nnal decisions were routinely made by inferior executive of-\nficers (or, perhaps, by mere executive employees).  See ante, \nat 17\u201318. If no statutory path to appeal to an executiveprincipal officer existed then, I see no constitutional reason why such a path must exist now. \nPerhaps this Vesting Clause theory misunderstands the\nmajority\u2019s argument.  After all, the Court never directly\nsays that any law or action violates the Vesting Clause.  The \nCourt simply criticizes as overly formalistic the notion thatboth Clauses do exactly what their names suggest: The Ap-\npointments Clause governs only appointments; the Vesting\nClause deals just with the vesting of executive power in the\nPresident.

Instead of holding as much \nexplicitly, the Court rewrites the statutory text to ensure \nthat the Director can directly review Board decisions.  Ante , \nat 21\u201322 (plurality opinion). Specifically, the Court de-\nclares unenforceable the statut ory provision that \u201cprevents \nthe Director from reviewing the decisions of the [Board] onhis own.\u201d Ante , at 22.  And as a remedy, the Court \u201cre -\nmand[s] to the Acting Director for him to decide whether torehear the petition.\u201d Ibid. In that way, the Court makes \nextra clear what should already be obvious: Administrativepatent judges are inferior officers. \nBut neither reading of the majority\u2019s opinion\u2014(1) that\nadministrative patent judges are principal officers that the Court has converted to inferior officers, or (2) that adminis-trative patent judges are infe rior officers whose decisions\nmust constitutionally be reversible by the Director alone\u2014supports its proposed remedy.\nTake the principal officer view.  If the Court truly be-\nlieved administrative patent ju dges are principal officers, \nthen the Court would need to vacate the Board\u2019s decision. \nAs this Court has twice explained, \u201cthe \u2018appropriate\u2019 rem-\nedy for an adjudication tainted with an appointments vio-\nlation is a new \u2018hearing before a properly appointed\u2019 offi-\ncial.\u201d Lucia , 585 U.

Ante , at 23 (plurality opinion).\nThe quasi-separation-of-powers view fares no better.  If \nwe accept as true the Court\u2019s position that the Appoint-ments Clause inherently grants the Director power to re-\nverse Board decisions, then another problem arises: No con-\nstitutional violation has occurred in this suit.  The Board had the power to decide and la wfully did decide the dispute\nbefore it. The Board did not misinterpret its statutory au -\nthority or try to prevent direct review by the Director.  Nor \ndid the Director wrongfully de cline to rehear the Board\u2019s\ndecision.  Moreover, Arthrex has not argued that it sought review by the Director.  So to  the extent \u201cthe source of the \nconstitutional violation is the restraint on the review au-thority of the Director,\u201d ibid., his review was not con-\nstrained. Without any constitutional violation in this suitto correct, one wonders how the Court has the power to is-sue a remedy.  See Carney v. Adams , 592 U. S. ___, ___ \n(2020) (slip op., at 4) (Article III prevents \u201cthe federal courts from issuing advisory opinions\u201d). \nPerhaps the majority thinks Arthrex should receive some \nkind of bounty for raising an Appointments Clause chal-lenge and almost  identifying a constitutional violation.  But \nthe Constitution allows us to award judgments, not partic-ipation trophies. \nIV \nAlthough unnecessary to resolve this suit, at some point \nit may be worth taking a closer look at whether the func-tional element of our test in Edmond\u2014the part that the \nCourt relies on today\u2014aligns with the text, history, and\nstructure of the Constitution.  The founding era history sur-\nrounding the Inferior Officer Cl ause points to at least three \ndifferent definitions of an inferi or officer, none of which re-\nquires a case-by-case functional examination of exactly how \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  18 UNITED STATES  v. ARTHREX, INC. \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \nmuch supervision and control another officer has.  The ra-\ntionales on which Edmond relies to graft a functional ele-\nment into the inferior-officer inquiry do not withstand close \nscrutiny. \nA \nEarly discussions of inferior officers reflect at least three\nunderstandings of who these officers were\u2014and who theywere not\u2014under the Appointments Clause. Though I donot purport to decide today whic h is best, it is worth noting \nthat administrative patent ju dges would be inferior under \neach. \n1 \nThe narrowest understanding divides all executive offic-\ners into three categories: heads of departments, superior of-\nficers, and inferior officers.  During the Constitutional Con-\nvention, James Madison supported this view in a brief discussion about the addition of the Inferior Officer Clause. \n2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 627 (M. Far -\nrand ed. 1911) (Farrand); see also Mascott, Who Are \u201cOffic-\ners of the United States,\u201d 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, 468, n. 131 \n(2018). Gouverneur Morris moved to add the clause. But \nMadison initially resisted.  He argued that it did \u201cnot go far\nenough if it be necessary at all [because] Superior Officers below Heads of Departments ought in some cases to have\nthe appointment of the lesser offices.\u201d  2 Farrand 627.  The \nmotion nonetheless passed.  The crux of Madison\u2019s objectionappears to rely on the idea t hat there are three types of of -\nficers: inferior officers, supe rior officers, and department \nheads. Congress could vest the appointment of inferior of-\nficers in the President, the courts, or a department head.\nBut the others must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. \nSome held a second understanding: Inferior officers en-\ncompass nearly all officers.  As Justice Story put it, \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 19 Cite as: 594 U. S. ____ (2021) \nTHOMAS , J., dissenting \n\u201c[w]hether the heads of departments  are inferior officers in \nthe sense of the constitution, was much discussed, in the \ndebate on the organization of the department of foreign af-fairs, in 1789.\u201d 3 Commentaries on the Constitution of the \nUnited States 386, n. 1 (1833) (emphasis added).  Propo-\nnents of this understanding argued that the Secretary of \nState should be an inferior officer because he was inferior \nto the President, \u201cthe Executive head of the department.\u201d  1 Annals of Cong. 509. In other words, inferior officers would \nencompass all executive officers inferior to the President, \nother than those specifically identified in the Constitution:\u201cAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.\u201d \nArt. II, \u00a72.\nThe constitutional text and history provide some support\nfor this rationale.  By using the adjective \u201csuch\u201d before \u201cin-\nferior Officers,\u201d the Clause about  inferior officers could be \nunderstood to refer back to \u201call other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise pro -\nvided for, and which shall be established by Law.\u201d Ibid. ; \nsee also 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language(6th ed. 1785) (defining \u201csuch\u201d to mean \u201c[c]omprehended \nunder the term premised, like what has been said\u201d).  And to \nbe \u201cinferiour\u201d means simply to be \u201c[l]ower in place\u201d; \u201c[l]ower in station or rank of life\u201d and  \u201c[s]ubordinate\u201d to another of -\nficer. 1 ibid.  Department heads are officers, and they are\nlower in rank and subordinate to the President. See U. S. \nConst., Art. II, \u00a71.\nBut others disagreed, contending this went \u201ctoo far; be-\ncause the Constitution\u201d elsewhere specifies \u201c \u2018the principal\nofficer in each of the Executive departments.\u2019\u201d 1 Annals of \nCong. 459. These Framers endorsed a third understanding, \nwhich distinguished just between inferior and principal of -\nficers. See id., at 518 (\u201cWe are to have a Secretary for For-\neign Affairs, another for War, and another for the Treasury;\nnow, are not these the principal officers in those depart-ments\u201d). A single officer coul d not simultaneously be both. \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 20 UNITED STATES  v.

Edmond, 520 U. S., \nat 663 (quoting Act of July 27, 1789, ch. 4, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132, 1 Stat.\n28\u201329).\nThis principal-inferior dichotomy also finds roots in the \nstructure of the Constitution, which specifically identifies\nboth principal officers (in the Opinions Clause and theTwenty-fifth Amendment) and inferior officers (in the Ap -\npointments Clause). And it comports with contemporane-ous dictionary definitions. A \u201cp rincipal\u201d officer is \u201c[a] head\u201d\nofficer; \u201ca chief; not a second .\u201d  2 Johnson, Dictionary of the\nEnglish Language. Other executive officers would, by defi-nition, be lower than or subordinate to these head officers. \nThe principal-inferior office r divide played out in other \ncontexts as well. In the debate over removability of officers,\nRepresentative Smith indicated that he \u201chad doubts \nwhether [an] officer could be removed by the President\u201d in \nlight of the impeachment process.  1 Annals of Cong. 372. \nMadison disagreed, arguing that impeachment alone for all \nremovals \u201cwould in effect establish every officer of the Gov-\nernment on the firm tenure of good behaviour; not the \nheads of Departments only, but all the inferior officers ofthose Departments, would hold th eir offices during good be-\nhaviour.\u201d Ibid. \nState constitutions at the founding lend credence to this\nidea that inferior officers encompass all officers except forthe heads of departments.  For example, the 1789 GeorgiaState Constitution provided that \u201cmilitia officers and the \nsecretaries of the governor . . . shall be appointed by the\ngovernor.\u201d Art. IV, \u00a72.  But \u201c[t]he general assembly may \nvest the appointment of inferior officers in the governor, the\ncourts of justice, or in such other manner as they may by law establish.\u201d  Ibid.  The law thus distinguished between\nsecretaries and inferior officers.

But \n\u201call inferior officers in the treasury department\u201d were to be\n\u201cappointed in such manner as is or may be directed by law.\u201d \n\u00a76.\nAlthough not dipositive, this Court has adopted the no-\nmenclature of the principal-inferior distinction. See, e.g., \nante,  at 5\u20136; Edmond , 520 U. S., at 661 (\u201cdistinguishing be-\ntween principal and inferior officers for AppointmentsClause purposes\u201d); Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.

And in reasoning adopted unanimously by the Court, at least one \nopinion defined \u201cprincipal offi cers\u201d for purposes of the Ap -\npointments Clause to be \u201cambassadors, ministers, heads of departments, and judges.\u201d  Freytag v. Commissioner , 501 \nU. S. 868, 884 (1991). \n2 \nRegardless of which of the three interpretations is cor-\nrect, all lead to the same result  here.  Administrative patent \njudges are inferior officers.\nStart with the broadest understanding.  A careful read of \nthe Appointments Clause reveal s that the office of \u201cadmin-\nistrative patent judge\u201d does no t appear amidst the offices of \nambassador, consul, public minister, and Supreme Court \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  22 UNITED STATES  v.

So, \nif inferior officers are all executive officers other than those \nwith special appointment processes laid out in the Consti -\ntution, then administrative patent judges squarely fit. \nAdministrative patent judges also fall on the inferior-\nofficer side of the inferior-principal divide.  It is agreed that\nadministrative patent judges are not the heads of any de-\npartment. See ante, at 8; Brief for Arthrex, Inc., 5\u20136 (noting \nthat the Secretary of Commerce is the relevant \u201cdepartment \nhead\u201d). Thus, to the extent a \u201cprincipal officer . . . is the \nequivalent of the head of department,\u201d administrative pa -\ntent judges are not one. Germaine , 99 U. S., at 511. \nAnd under the Madisonian tripartite system, administra-\ntive patent judges would still be inferior.  These judges are\nnot heads of departments. Nor are they \u201csuperior officers.\u201d\nAn administrative patent judge is not \u201c[h]igher\u201d than or\n\u201cgreater in dignity or excellence\u201d to other officers inferior to\nhim. 2 Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language (de-fining \u201cSuperiour\u201d). Tellingly, neither respondent nor the \nmajority identify a single  officer lower in rank or subordi-\nnate to administrative patent judges.  Surely if \u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a su-\nperior,\u201d then whether one is a superior officer depends on whether he has an inferior. Edmond, 520 U. S., at 662; see \nalso Morrison , 487 U.

In con trast, an administrative patent \njudge is lower in rank and subord inate to both the Director \nand the Secretary. \n* * * \nTo be clear, I do not purport to have exhausted all con -\ntemporaneous debates, sources, and writings.  Perhaps there is some reason to believ e that the inherent nature of \nan inferior officer requires that all of their decisions be di-\nrectly appealable to a Senate-confirmed executive officer. \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n 23 Cite as: 594 U.

And, without any \njustification in the text, in the history, or in our precedent, \nI would not impose that requirement. \nB \nIf anything, the Court\u2019s functional prong in Edmond  may\nmerit reconsideration. The Edmond opinion highlighted \nthree justifications for its decision to require more than just \na lower rank and a superior officer.  But having reviewedthe history, it is worth checking whether these reasons are \nsound. They may not be. \nFirst, Edmond highlighted the Constitution\u2019s use of the \nterm \u201cinferior officer.\u201d 520 U. S., at 663.  Were the Appoint-\nments Clause meant to identify only lower ranking officers, \nthen the Constitution could have used the phrase \u201c \u2018lesser \nofficer.\u2019 \u201d  Ibid . But Madison\u2019s objection to the Inferior Of-\nficer Clause pokes a hole in this  distinction.  After all, Mad-\nison used almost exactly this  \u201clesser officer\u201d phrasing: He\nurged a broader clause so that  \u201csuperior officers\u201d could \n\u201chave the appointment of the lesser offices.\u201d 2 Farrand 627 \n(emphasis added). If Madison understood the two terms to \nbe interchangeable, perhaps this Court should too.\nSecond, Edmond flagged that the Appointments Clause\nwas designed \u201cto preserve political accountability relative \nto important Government assignments.\u201d  520 U. S., at 663. \nBut the accountability feature of the Appointments Clause\nwas not about accountability for specific decisions  made by \ninferior officers, but ra ther accountability for \u201c \u2018a bad nomi -\nnation.\u2019 \u201d  Id., at 660 (quoting The Federalist No. 77, p. 392\n(M.

Take, for example, the Act establishing\nthe Department of War: It referred \u201cto the Secretary of that\ndepartment as a \u2018principal officer,\u2019 \u201d and provided that \u201cthe \nChief Clerk, would be \u2018employe d\u2019 within the Department as\nthe Secretary \u2018shall deem proper ,\u2019 as an \u2018inferior officer.\u2019 \u201d  \nEdmond, 520 U. S., at 664 (quoting ch. 7, 1 Stat. 49\u201350). \nBut not every officer was neatly categorized as a principal \nofficer or an inferior one. Fo r example, the Act of Congress\nEstablishing the Treasury Department created \u201cthe follow-\ning officers, namely: a Secreta ry of the Treasury, to be\ndeemed head of the department; a Comptroller . . . , and an Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, which assistant\nshall be appointed by the said Secretary.\u201d  Act of Sept. 2,1789, ch. 12, \u00a71, 1 Stat. 65.  The statute does not label the \nComptroller as a principal offi cer or a department head.\nNor is he expressly designated as an inferior officer.  More-over, his duties extended beyond doing merely what the\nSecretary deemed proper.

Yet at least one early legislator (with no recorded\nobjections) thought \u201cthe Comptroller was an inferior of-\nficer.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. 613 (Stone). \nGiven the lack of historical support, it is curious that the\nCourt has decided to expand Edmond\u2019s \u201cfunctional\u201d prong\nto elevate administrative patent judges to principal-officer\nstatus (only to demote them back to inferior-officer status).\nPerhaps the Court fears that a more formal interpretation \n   \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n 25 Cite as: 594 U.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now advanced significantly, moving from a model based on one party's arguments and a set of hypotheses to a comprehensive view of the direct legal clash between the petitioner and respondents. The foundational elements of my belief\u2014that the case hinges on the Appointments Clause and severability, with precedents like *Lucia v. SEC*, *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, *Edmond v. United States*, and *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* being paramount\u2014remain stable and have been reinforced. My knowledge of the government's position is also unchanged: they contend Task Force members are inferior officers due to the HHS Secretary's purported power of at-will removal and the ability to use the one-year statutory interval as a de facto veto, and that if a violation is found, the remedy is to sever the independence clause per *Arthrex*.\n\nThe new observation, the respondents' (Braidwood Management, et al.) Brief in Support of Certiorari, has provided the critical counterarguments I had previously identified as unresolved variables. My analytical model is now populated with the specific legal theories from both sides.\n\nHere is how the respondents' arguments, as revealed in their brief, directly answer my previous questions and refine my beliefs:\n\n1.  **Rebuttal to At-Will Removal (Principal vs. Inferior Officer Status):** My model sought the respondents' counter to the government's claim that removal power makes Task Force members inferior officers. The brief provides a direct rebuttal: **\"An officer does not automatically become an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer whenever he is subject to at-will removal by a principal officer.\"** They argue, citing *Edmond v. United States*, that the dispositive test for an inferior officer is being \"directed and supervised at some level\" by a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed officer. They contend that removal power is not a sufficient condition on its own. Because the Task Force is not directed or supervised, its members are principal officers who must be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, regardless of any claimed removal power.\n\n2.  **Rebuttal to Meaningful Review (Supervision):** I needed to know how respondents would characterize the one-year interval and the Secretary's supervisory role. The brief confirms my hypothesis that they would see it as legally insignificant for supervisory purposes. Their core argument rests on the statute itself, specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which mandates that the Task Force and its recommendations **\"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"** They argue this provision makes it legally impossible for the Secretary to \"direct\" or \"supervise\" the Task Force's recommendations. The power to issue these \"compulsory-coverage edicts\" is vested unilaterally in the Task Force. Therefore, the one-year interval is not an opportunity for substantive review and veto; once the Task Force issues a recommendation, its path to becoming a binding mandate is automatic and beyond the Secretary's control.\n\n3.  **Counter-Argument on Severability:** My model required the respondents' position on the government's proposed *Arthrex*-style remedy. The brief explicitly states that the Fifth Circuit **\"correctly refused to remedy the Appointments Clause violations by \u2018severing\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).\"** Their rationale is that the Task Force's independence was a central feature of the legislative design intended by Congress. To surgically remove the independence clause would be to judicially rewrite the statute, creating an administrative structure that Congress did not enact. They argue this would be an improper exercise of judicial power, and that the only appropriate remedy for the constitutional violation is to invalidate the unconstitutional actions taken by the improperly appointed Task Force.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has matured from identifying the questions to understanding the answers. I now possess a clear, symmetrical view of the legal battlefield. The conflict is no longer abstract; it is a direct confrontation between two well-defined, competing interpretations of statute and precedent. The government's \"removal and review\" theory of inferiority is countered by the respondents' \"direction and supervision\" theory of principality. The government's *Arthrex*-based severability argument is countered by the respondents' argument that such a remedy would constitute judicial overreach. My predictive task now shifts to analyzing how the current members of the Supreme Court are likely to resolve these specific, head-to-head legal disputes.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been substantially refined by this new observation, moving beyond the parties' stated arguments to a deeper analysis of the controlling precedents. My foundational understanding\u2014that the case turns on the Appointments Clause (principal vs. inferior officer) and severability, with *Lucia*, *Edmond*, and *Arthrex* as the key cases\u2014remains stable. The specific arguments of the petitioner (government) and respondents (Braidwood) also remain unchanged. However, the new information, particularly the primary text and analysis of *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, provides a powerful analytical lens through which to evaluate those arguments and predict the Supreme Court's likely reasoning.\n\nMy model is now enhanced with the following specific insights drawn from the Court's recent jurisprudence:\n\n1.  **The Primacy of Reviewability in the Principal/Inferior Officer Test:** The syllabus and analysis of *Arthrex* (Docs 55, 68) clarify that the dispositive factor for an adjudicative body like the PTAB is whether a principal officer can review its final decisions. The *Arthrex* majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, stated, \"What is significant... is that the judges... have no power to render a final decision on behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\" This precedent directly supports Braidwood's argument. The statutory independence of the Preventive Services Task Force and the lack of a mechanism for the HHS Secretary to review or overturn its recommendations create a direct parallel to the constitutional defect identified in *Arthrex*.\n\n2.  **Skepticism of \"Indirect Control\" Arguments:** The *Arthrex* opinion (Doc 55) explicitly considered and rejected the government's arguments about indirect methods of control, such as stacking panels or other \"machinations.\" The Court characterized these not as a solution but as \"the problem,\" because they \"blur the lines of accountability.\" This precedent significantly weakens the government's argument in the present case that the HHS Secretary's ability to use the one-year statutory interval as a de facto veto constitutes sufficient supervision. The Court is likely to view such an indirect, non-transparent mechanism with the same skepticism it showed in *Arthrex*, favoring a clear, formal line of review authority.\n\n3.  **Accountability as the Constitutional Touchstone:** The analysis in both the *Arthrex* opinion (Doc 55) and the Rappaport article (Doc 68) underscores that the Roberts Court's framework for the Appointments Clause is grounded in ensuring \"political accountability.\" The logic is that power must be traceable up a \"clear and effective chain of command\" to the President. The insulation of the Task Force from the HHS Secretary's control directly breaks this chain, making it difficult to hold a politically accountable officer responsible for the binding preventive care mandates. This aligns perfectly with Braidwood's core constitutional claim.\n\n4.  **The Precedent for a \"Surgical\" Severability Remedy:** While the analysis of the constitutional violation favors Braidwood, the analysis of the remedy in *Arthrex* strongly favors the government. The *Arthrex* plurality (Doc 55) did not strike down the entire PTAB system. Instead, it rendered the statutory provision preventing the Director from reviewing APJ decisions unenforceable, thereby creating the necessary review authority to cure the constitutional defect. This is precisely the \"severability\" remedy the government proposes for the Task Force\u2014excising the independence clause (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) to make the Task Force's recommendations subject to the HHS Secretary's review and final approval. This precedent directly contradicts Braidwood's argument that such a remedy constitutes impermissible judicial rewriting of the statute.\n\n**Updated Predictive Model:**\n\nMy belief state has now coalesced around a specific, highly plausible outcome. I have moved from simply understanding the competing arguments to seeing a clear path the Court might take, guided by its own recent and highly analogous decision in *Arthrex*.\n\n*   **On Question 1 (Appointments Clause Violation):** I now believe it is highly likely the Court will find the Task Force's structure unconstitutional. The reasoning in *Arthrex* regarding the lack of review by a principal officer provides a direct and compelling precedent. The Court's emphasis on accountability and its dismissal of \"indirect control\" theories suggest it will side with Braidwood on the merits of the constitutional violation.\n*   **On Question 2 (Severability):** I now believe it is highly likely the Court will adopt the government's proposed remedy of severing the independence clause. The remedial approach in *Arthrex* establishes a clear precedent for this \"surgical\" fix. The Court has shown a preference for mending, rather than ending, statutory schemes where possible.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is no longer a simple weighing of two opposing views, but a forecast of a specific, bifurcated outcome: the Court will likely find for Braidwood on the constitutional question but adopt the government's position on the remedy. This would invalidate the Task Force's independence but preserve the preventive care mandate system by making it subject to the oversight of the HHS Secretary.",

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

See Secretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment and \nProspective Appointment: Appointment Affidavits (June 28, \n2023), http://bit.ly/3Yt94C0 [https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN]; see \nalso http://bit.ly/4dR3xK7 (archived website taken on December \n20, 2023) (\u201cTask Force members are appointed by the Secretary \nof HHS to serve 4-year terms.\u201d); Opening Br. for the Federal \nDefendants, Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11.

App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet.

II. Pet. App. \n116a (\u201c \u2018[T]he term \u201cDepartment\u201d refers only to a part or \ndivision of the executive government, as the Department \nof State, or of the Treasury, expressly created and given \n \n12.

App. 83a.  \nB. The Appellate-Court Proceedings \nThe defendants appealed and asked for a stay pend-\ning appeal of the district court\u2019s universal remedies.

[I]t is a clear \nand express directive from Congress that the \nTask Force be free from any supervision. In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet. App. 20a. The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure. Pet. \nApp. 23a (\u201c[T]he statutory scheme . . . envisions no su-\npervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure.\u201d); see also Jennings v.

The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id. (\u201c[T]he man-\ndates deprive Braidwood of the ability to choose whether \nand to what extent its insurance plan covers preventive \ncare.\u201d); Pet. App. 95a\u201397a (describing each of Braid-\nwood\u2019s Article III injuries). And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 7\u201319, Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. \n46. \n22. The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing. To resolve questions raised in litigation and out \nof an abundance of caution, for purposes of coverage un-\nder the statute, I ratify the below listed guidelines and \nrecommendations for the reasons relied on by the \nUSPSTF, ACIP and the Director of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC Director), and the \nHRSA Administrator in their previously published deci-\nsions or analyses regarding the relevant recommenda-\ntions. This action is not intended to suggest any legal de-\nfect or infirmity in the authority of these entities to issue \npreventive service guidelines and recommendations. \n\u2022 Evidence-based clinical preventive services that \nhave in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the rec-\nommendations of the USPSTF as of the date of \nthis ratification, with the exception of the 2016 \n\n 6a \nUSPSTF recommendation on screening for \nbreast cancer, set forth in Exhibit A, attached; \n\u2022 Immunizations that have in effect a recommenda-\ntion from ACIP and the CDC Director with re-\nspect to the individual involved as of the date of \nthis ratification, set forth in Exhibit B, attached; \n\u2022 With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings \nprovided for in the comprehensive guidelines sup-\nported by HRSA as of the date of this ratification, \nset forth in Exhibit C, attached; and \n\u2022 With respect to women, such additional preven-\ntive care and screenings as provided for in com-\nprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for \npurposes of 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 300gg13(a) as of the \ndate of this ratification, set forth in Exhibit D, at-\ntached. \nPursuant to my authority as Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and based on my independent and con-\nsidered review of the actions and decisions listed above, I \nhereby affirm and ratify the above recommendations and \nguidelines. \n \n January 21, 2022 \n \nXavier Becerra \nDate",

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state continues to be built upon the foundational understanding that this case turns on the Appointments Clause and severability, with *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* serving as the most powerful and recent precedent. The core tenets of my belief, derived from *Arthrex*, remain stable: (1) the lack of review by a principal officer is the key indicator of an Appointments Clause violation for an adjudicative body; (2) \"indirect control\" arguments are viewed with skepticism by the Court; (3) political accountability is the constitutional touchstone; and (4) a \"surgical\" severability remedy that preserves a statutory scheme is preferred over invalidating it entirely.\n\nThis framework led me to a predictive model forecasting a bifurcated outcome: the Court will likely agree with Braidwood that the Task Force's structure is unconstitutional (Question 1), but will adopt the government's proposed remedy of severing the independence clause, thus preserving the mandate system under the HHS Secretary's authority (Question 2).\n\nThe latest observation, which is an internal reflection on my analytical process, does not introduce new external facts but critically refines my understanding of my own model's limitations. I now recognize that my high confidence in the severability outcome was based primarily on the government's position and the *Arthrex* precedent, without having fully processed the respondents' specific counter-arguments on that point.\n\nMy updated beliefs incorporate this new layer of analytical nuance:\n\n1.  **Identification of a Critical Uncertainty:** My model is now more sophisticated because it explicitly identifies the most critical point of uncertainty: How do the respondents (Braidwood) argue against the application of the *Arthrex* severability remedy? My previous prediction implicitly assumed their arguments would be unpersuasive, but I now see the need to test that assumption directly. The strength and nature of Braidwood's argument for why this case is distinguishable from *Arthrex* on the remedy question is the single most important variable I need to resolve.\n\n2.  **Conditional Prediction:** My prediction of a \"Yes; Yes\" outcome (violation found; statute saved by severance) is now explicitly conditional. It remains the most likely outcome *if* the respondents cannot compellingly distinguish the severability facts here from those in *Arthrex*. Potential distinguishing arguments could be that the Task Force's independence was a more central and non-negotiable part of the congressional bargain in the ACA than the parallel provision was in the America Invents Act, making judicial severance an improper rewriting of the statute.\n\n3.  **Refined Predictive Model:** My belief state has evolved from a confident prediction to a confident *hypothesis*. The hypothesis is that the Court will find a violation but sever the independence clause. This hypothesis now requires testing against the specific evidence of the respondents' merits brief. My confidence in the final prediction is therefore tempered, pending the analysis of how Braidwood attempts to overcome the powerful remedial precedent set by Chief Justice Roberts's opinion in *Arthrex*. My focus has sharpened from the general legal landscape to the specific clash over the applicability of the *Arthrex* remedy.",

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7. See http://bit.ly/3Nrntbo [https://perma.cc/B68B-VTMW] (ar-\nchived website taken on September 28, 2023) (\u201cTask Force \nmembers are appointed by the Director of AHRQ to serve 4-\nyear terms.\u201d).  \n8. See Secretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment and \nProspective Appointment: Appointment Affidavits (June 28, \n2023), http://bit.ly/3Yt94C0 [https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN]; see \nalso http://bit.ly/4dR3xK7 (archived website taken on December \n20, 2023) (\u201cTask Force members are appointed by the Secretary \nof HHS to serve 4-year terms.\u201d); Opening Br. for the Federal \nDefendants, Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department.

II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet.

In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet.

The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure.

The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id. (\u201c[T]he man-\ndates deprive Braidwood of the ability to choose whether \nand to what extent its insurance plan covers preventive \ncare.\u201d); Pet. App. 95a\u201397a (describing each of Braid-\nwood\u2019s Article III injuries). And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 7\u201319, Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. \n46. \n22. The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

R. Civ. P. \n58(a). \nThis action came on for consideration by the Court, \nand the issues having been duly considered and a deci-\nsion duly rendered in the Court\u2019s orders partially grant-\ning and partially denying the parties\u2019 motions for sum-\nmary judgment. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED that: \n\n 2a \n1)  All claims of Joel Miller and Gregory Scheideman \nin the above-entitled and numbered cause are \nhereby DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n \n2) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration (HRSA) do not, on the rec-\nord in this case, violate Article II\u2019s Appointments \nclause. Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing.

          "task_beliefs": "My foundational belief, grounded in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, remains that this case will be decided on the principles of political accountability and the Court's preference for surgical severability. The predictive model continues to anticipate a bifurcated outcome based on the two legal questions.\n\nThe new observation, the respondents' Brief in Support of Certiorari, provides the first direct evidence of their legal strategy, allowing me to test the hypothesis I formulated in the previous step. My beliefs have been updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Confirmation of Respondents' Appointments Clause Argument:** The brief confirms that the respondents' (Braidwood's) argument for an Appointments Clause violation aligns perfectly with the Court's recent jurisprudence. They argue that Task Force members are \"principal officers\" because they are not \"directed and supervised\" by a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed officer, citing the key precedent *Edmond v. United States*. They specifically weaponize the statutory language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which mandates that the Task Force be \"independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure,\" as direct proof that the constitutional requirement of supervision is absent. This strengthens my conviction that the Court will find an Appointments Clause violation (a \"Yes\" on Question 1).\n\n2.  **Resolution of a Critical Uncertainty on Severability:** My previous belief state identified a key uncertainty: how Braidwood would argue against the *Arthrex* severability remedy. The observation resolves this. The brief's structure, with a section titled \"The court of appeals correctly refused to remedy the Appointments Clause violations by \u2018severing\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6),\" confirms that Braidwood is not conceding the remedy. Their position is that the Fifth Circuit was correct to enjoin the mandates rather than judicially rewriting the statute to make the Task Force subordinate to the HHS Secretary.\n\n3.  **Decreased Confidence in the Severability Outcome:** While my prior hypothesis favored the government's severability argument based on the strength of the *Arthrex* precedent, my confidence in this outcome has now decreased. The observation confirms that the remedy will be a central and contested battleground, not an afterthought. The fact that respondents are explicitly arguing against severance, framing it as an improper judicial nullification of the independence clause, elevates the possibility that the Court could decline to save the statutory scheme. The presence of Jonathan Mitchell as counsel of record, known for structural challenges to the administrative state, further signals that the argument against severance will be robust and aimed at dismantling the provision rather than reforming it.\n\n4.  **Refined Predictive Model:** My predictive model is now more nuanced. The most likely outcome remains a \"Yes; Yes\" (violation found; statute saved by severance), but the probability of this outcome has been reduced. The probability of a \"Yes; No\" outcome (violation found; severance rejected, thus invalidating the Task Force's authority) has increased. The central predictive task has shifted from *assuming* the *Arthrex* remedy would apply to now evaluating the specific clash: will the Chief Justice Roberts-authored logic from *Arthrex* favoring a narrow, saving construction prevail over what is likely to be a forceful textual and structural argument from Braidwood that the Task Force's independence was a non-severable part of the ACA's legislative bargain? The specific details of Braidwood's anti-severability argument, which were not fully present in the truncated document, are now the most critical unknown variable.",

It moves the key uncertainty (\u03b8) from a general question about severability to a specific, high-stakes clash between the Court's pragmatic remedial approach (*Arthrex*) and a sophisticated jurisprudential challenge to that power (the 'writ-of-erasure' theory). This clarification is a massive gain in understanding the task, as it pinpoints the precise legal battleground for the second question and identifies the exact information needed next (the government's counter-argument).\n\nFor Design EIG, the action is a textbook example of an effective BOED strategy. It demonstrates a generalizable, iterative process: 1) observe new data (the respondent's brief), 2) update beliefs and confirm/disconfirm hypotheses, 3) identify a new, more refined key uncertainty, and 4) plan the next optimal action to resolve it. It also highlights the advanced heuristic of incorporating counsel's known legal philosophies (Jonathan Mitchell) into the model.

The argument is not merely a generic claim about legislative intent but a sophisticated, multi-layered challenge to the Court's remedial power, rooted in a specific judicial philosophy.\n    *   **The Core Argument Revealed:** Respondents frame the government's request for severance as a demand that the Court \"nullify\" the independence provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)). This is a direct appeal to judicial restraint.\n    *   **The \"Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy\":** The citation of Jonathan Mitchell's own law review article, \"The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy,\" is a critical signal. It reveals the theoretical foundation of their position: that courts lack the power to \"erase\" or \"rewrite\" statutes. Instead, their proper role is simply to decline to enforce an unconstitutional law against the parties before them. This transforms their argument from a standard severability debate into a fundamental challenge to the remedial approach taken in cases like *Arthrex*.\n    *   **Impact on Predictive Model:** My confidence in a \"Yes; Yes\" outcome (violation found; statute saved by severance) has now substantially decreased. The anti-severability argument is more potent and jurisprudentially ambitious than anticipated. Consequently, the probability of a \"Yes; No\" outcome (violation found; severance rejected) has increased markedly. The central predictive task is no longer just about applying the *Arthrex* precedent, but about predicting which remedial philosophy will prevail: the Roberts Court's institutionalist preference for narrow, statute-saving surgery, or the textualist/originalist philosophy, championed by Mitchell, that views such remedies as judicial overreach. The votes of Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett on this specific question of judicial power will be decisive.",

Supp. 3d 613 and 627 F. \nSupp. 3d 624.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJune 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on September 19, 2024, and granted on January 10, \n2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced at App., infra, 1a-7a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, ensures democratic accountability.  A gov-\nernment official who exercises continuing, \u201csignificant \nauthority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d is \nan officer of the United States.  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. \n237, 245 (2018) (citation omitted).  And all officers who \nwield executive power on the President\u2019s behalf must \noperate within \u201ca clear and effective chain of command\u201d \nleading up to the President.  United States v. Arthrex, \nInc., 594 U.S. 1, 11 (2021) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 498 \n(2010)).  The President must be able to hold all his subor-\ndinates fully accountable, and the President, in turn, is \nfully accountable to the People.   \nOfficers who have the \u201cpower to render a final deci-\nsion on behalf of the United States\u201d and answer only to \nthe President are principal officers.  Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 665 (1997).  As such, they must be \nappointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and \nconsent\u2014a method that holds both actors politically ac-\ncountable for principal officers\u2019 ensuing decisions.  Id. \nat 659-660.  By contrast, inferior officers can also be ap-\npointed by \u201cthe President alone,  * * *  the Courts of Law, \nor  * * *  the Heads of Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2.  The Framers afforded that more stream-\nlined method of appointment to assuage concerns that \nsuch \u201coffices\u201d would \u201cbec[o]me numerous, and sudden \nremovals necessary.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 12 (quoting \nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879)).  \n\n3 \n \nBut that method imposes adequate accountability only \nif principal officers continue to supervise inferior offic-\ners and retain ultimate responsibility for legally binding \ndecisions.   \nThis case turns on how to classify members of the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (Task \nForce).  The Task Force sits within the Public Health \nService, which is itself a component of the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS).  All agree that \nTask Force members are officers of some kind, because \nthey exercise significant, continuing governmental au-\nthority.  Specifically, they can make recommendations \nconcerning preventive services that, by operation of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. \nL. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), health-insurance \nissuers and group health plans must cover without re-\nquiring cost sharing by patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).   \nThe question is whether Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers, or instead principal \nofficers whose appointments are unconstitutional be-\ncause they are not presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed.  The answer is straightforward:  Task Force \nmembers are inferior officers, because the Secretary  \nof HHS\u2014a quintessential principal officer\u2014remains \nresponsible for final decisions about whether Task \nForce recommendations will be legally binding on in-\nsurance issuers and group health plans.  The Secretary \ncan remove Task Force members at will, for any  \nreason\u2014perhaps the most \u201cpowerful tool for control\u201d of \ntheir conduct.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  And the Sec-\nretary can review the Task Force\u2019s preventive-services \nrecommendations and decide to deny them legal force \nunder the ACA before those recommendations have \nbinding effect.  Taken together, those controls give the \n\n4 \n \nSecretary, not the Task Force, ultimate responsibility \nfor whether Task Force recommendations become final, \nbinding decisions.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling \ndeclaring the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitutional \nerroneously dismissed both of those means of secretar-\nial control, which create a chain of supervisory account-\nability through the Secretary to the President. \nEven if the statutory framework meant that Task \nForce members were principal officers, the Appoint-\nments Clause violation would be cured by severing the \nprovision that the court of appeals regarded as preclud-\ning principal-officer review of the Task Force\u2019s deci-\nsions.  That is the cure that this Court chose in Arthrex.  \nSee 594 U.S. at 26.  Yet the Fifth Circuit declined to fol-\nlow that path, instead viewing the Task Force as unlaw-\nfully exercising governmental authority for nearly 15 \nyears and barring the Task Force from continuing to \nexercise such authority absent new legislation.  This \nCourt should at a minimum reverse the severability \nholding and allow the Task Force to make recommen-\ndations that will have legal effect only under appropri-\nate supervision by the Secretary.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Since 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS \nhas relied on the Task Force\u2014a group composed of \u201cna-\ntionally recognized non-Federal experts in prevention \nand evidence-based medicine\u201d\u2014to develop recommen-\ndations about preventive health services.  J.A. 37.  Pre-\nventive health services include screenings and medica-\ntions to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cservices \ncan help people avoid acute illness, identify and treat \nchronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier  \ndetection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014 \n\n5 \n \nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2.  \nIn 1999, Congress codified the Task Force\u2019s role by \nexpressly authorizing the Director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency \nwithin the Public Health Service, to \u201cperiodically con-\nvene\u201d the Task Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality \nAct of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 \nStat. 1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  Congress also \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  As a thresh-\nold step, the Task Force \u201cselects and prioritizes topics \nfor review.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 77 (Jan. 28, 2022).  \u201cAny-\none,\u201d including \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201corganizations,\u201d \u201ccan \nnominate a new topic for Task Force consideration.\u201d  \nIbid. \nAfter the Task Force chooses a topic, creates a re-\nsearch plan, and reviews the evidence, the Task Force \nmay formulate a \u201cdraft recommendation statement\u201d for \na particular preventive service.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 81.  \nThe Task Force then posts the \u201cdraft recommendation \nstatement,\u201d along with the relevant \u201cevidence,\u201d on its \nwebsite \u201cfor public comment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cDuring the com-\nment period, any member of the public may submit com-\nments.\u201d  Ibid.  Based on those comments, the Task Force \nmay \u201cpropose revisions to the recommendation.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n6 \n \nAll Task Force members then vote on the final rec-\nommendation.  See J.A. 50-51.  If adopted, the Task \nForce posts the recommendation on its website.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 81.  The Task Force also publishes its rec-\nommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical Preventive Ser-\nvices,\u201d a resource for medical professionals, Congress, \nand other policymakers.  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).   \nWith the 2010 enactment of the ACA, Congress for \nthe first time provided that some of the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations could have binding legal effects.  Spe-\ncifically, the ACA requires health-insurance issuers and \ngroup health plans to cover certain preventive services \nwithout imposing copayments, deductibles, or other \ncost-sharing charges on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage without cost sharing \nfor \u201cevidence-based items or services that have in effect \na rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of \nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).1   \n2. The applicable statutes enable secretarial control \nover the Task Force and the process by which its rec-\nommendations may become legally binding.  The Secre-\ntary can appoint Task Force members and has appointed \nthe 16 members currently serving on the Task Force.  \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that it \ndeems to have a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations for services that have at least a moderate certainty \nof a moderate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services \nthat have at least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.  J.A. \n45-46. \n\n7 \n \nSecretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment \nand Prospective Appointment: Appointment Affidavit \n(June 28, 2023) (Appointment Ratification), https:// \nperma.cc/8TAA-7AMN.  Task Force members serve \nfour-year terms.  See J.A. 39.  Significantly, the Secre-\ntary can remove them at will before the end of their \nterm, because there are no statutory restrictions on a \nmember\u2019s removal.  See 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & \nSupp. IV 2022).   \nThe ACA also gives the Secretary other powers to \nsupervise Task Force recommendations.  The statute \nprovides that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall establish a mini-\nmum interval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation  * * *  is issued\u201d and the date on which issuers \nand plans must cover the recommended service without \ncost sharing for a new plan year.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(1).  The minimum interval established by the Sec-\nretary \u201cshall not be less than 1 year.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(2).  Under current regulations, the interval for \nmost recommendations is one year.  See 45 C.F.R. \n147.130(b)(1).    \nIn addition, Congress has vested the Secretary with \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, 80 Stat. 1610 (Reor-\nganization Plan), \u201call functions of the Public Health Ser-\nvice\u201d and of its \u201cofficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d \nwere transferred to the Secretary, \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Act of Oct. 19, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 \n(ratifying the Reorganization Plan as law).  Congress \nhas also empowered the Secretary to \u201cmake such provi-\nsions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the per-\nformance of any of the functions transferred to him by \nthe provisions of this reorganization plan by any officer, \nemployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or \n\n8 \n \nHHS.  Reorganization Plan \u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  The Sec-\nretary is further authorized to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, and to \u201ccarry \nout\u201d AHRQ\u2019s mission and duties by \u201cacting through [its] \nDirector,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 299(a).   \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. The Task Force\u2019s current \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations\u2014which the Secretary has allowed to take effect \nand has since expressly ratified\u2014cover more than 50 \npreventive services.

Under the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. \n119, health-insurance-coverage issuers and group health \nplans must cover certain preventive services recom-\nmended by the Task Force without imposing any cost-\nsharing requirements on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).  The question presented is as follows: \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appoint-\nments Clause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, and in de-\nclining to sever the statutory provision that it found to \nunduly insulate the Task Force from the HHS Secre-\ntary\u2019s supervision.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING  \nPetitioners (defendants-appellants/cross-appellees \nbelow) are Robert F.

The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on September 19, 2024, and granted on January 10, \n2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced at App., infra, 1a-7a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Appointments Clause of the Constitution, Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, ensures democratic accountability.  A gov-\nernment official who exercises continuing, \u201csignificant \nauthority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d is \nan officer of the United States.  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. \n237, 245 (2018) (citation omitted).  And all officers who \nwield executive power on the President\u2019s behalf must \noperate within \u201ca clear and effective chain of command\u201d \nleading up to the President.  United States v. Arthrex, \nInc., 594 U.S. 1, 11 (2021) (quoting Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 498 \n(2010)).  The President must be able to hold all his subor-\ndinates fully accountable, and the President, in turn, is \nfully accountable to the People.   \nOfficers who have the \u201cpower to render a final deci-\nsion on behalf of the United States\u201d and answer only to \nthe President are principal officers.  Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 665 (1997).  As such, they must be \nappointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s advice and \nconsent\u2014a method that holds both actors politically ac-\ncountable for principal officers\u2019 ensuing decisions.  Id. \nat 659-660.  By contrast, inferior officers can also be ap-\npointed by \u201cthe President alone,  * * *  the Courts of Law, \nor  * * *  the Heads of Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. \nII, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2.  The Framers afforded that more stream-\nlined method of appointment to assuage concerns that \nsuch \u201coffices\u201d would \u201cbec[o]me numerous, and sudden \nremovals necessary.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 12 (quoting \nUnited States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879)).  \n\n3 \n \nBut that method imposes adequate accountability only \nif principal officers continue to supervise inferior offic-\ners and retain ultimate responsibility for legally binding \ndecisions.   \nThis case turns on how to classify members of the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (Task \nForce).  The Task Force sits within the Public Health \nService, which is itself a component of the Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS).  All agree that \nTask Force members are officers of some kind, because \nthey exercise significant, continuing governmental au-\nthority.  Specifically, they can make recommendations \nconcerning preventive services that, by operation of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. \nL. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010), health-insurance \nissuers and group health plans must cover without re-\nquiring cost sharing by patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(1).   \nThe question is whether Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers, or instead principal \nofficers whose appointments are unconstitutional be-\ncause they are not presidentially appointed and Senate \nconfirmed.  The answer is straightforward:  Task Force \nmembers are inferior officers, because the Secretary  \nof HHS\u2014a quintessential principal officer\u2014remains \nresponsible for final decisions about whether Task \nForce recommendations will be legally binding on in-\nsurance issuers and group health plans.  The Secretary \ncan remove Task Force members at will, for any  \nreason\u2014perhaps the most \u201cpowerful tool for control\u201d of \ntheir conduct.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  And the Sec-\nretary can review the Task Force\u2019s preventive-services \nrecommendations and decide to deny them legal force \nunder the ACA before those recommendations have \nbinding effect.  Taken together, those controls give the \n\n4 \n \nSecretary, not the Task Force, ultimate responsibility \nfor whether Task Force recommendations become final, \nbinding decisions.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary ruling \ndeclaring the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitutional \nerroneously dismissed both of those means of secretar-\nial control, which create a chain of supervisory account-\nability through the Secretary to the President. \nEven if the statutory framework meant that Task \nForce members were principal officers, the Appoint-\nments Clause violation would be cured by severing the \nprovision that the court of appeals regarded as preclud-\ning principal-officer review of the Task Force\u2019s deci-\nsions.  That is the cure that this Court chose in Arthrex.  \nSee 594 U.S. at 26.  Yet the Fifth Circuit declined to fol-\nlow that path, instead viewing the Task Force as unlaw-\nfully exercising governmental authority for nearly 15 \nyears and barring the Task Force from continuing to \nexercise such authority absent new legislation.  This \nCourt should at a minimum reverse the severability \nholding and allow the Task Force to make recommen-\ndations that will have legal effect only under appropri-\nate supervision by the Secretary.  \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. Since 1984, the Public Health Service within HHS \nhas relied on the Task Force\u2014a group composed of \u201cna-\ntionally recognized non-Federal experts in prevention \nand evidence-based medicine\u201d\u2014to develop recommen-\ndations about preventive health services.  J.A. 37.  Pre-\nventive health services include screenings and medica-\ntions to avoid serious health conditions.  Such \u201cservices \ncan help people avoid acute illness, identify and treat \nchronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier  \ndetection, and improve health.\u201d  HHS, Issue Brief\u2014 \n\n5 \n \nAccess to Preventive Services without Cost-Sharing: \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act 1 (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/BGV4-N8U2.  \nIn 1999, Congress codified the Task Force\u2019s role by \nexpressly authorizing the Director of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency \nwithin the Public Health Service, to \u201cperiodically con-\nvene\u201d the Task Force.  Healthcare Research and Quality \nAct of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec. 2(a), \u00a7 915(a)(1), 113 \nStat. 1659; see 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  Congress also \nspecified that \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force  * * *  \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe Task Force \u201creview[s] the scientific evidence re-\nlated to the effectiveness, appropriateness, and cost- \neffectiveness of clinical preventive services for the pur-\npose of developing recommendations for the health care \ncommunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  As a thresh-\nold step, the Task Force \u201cselects and prioritizes topics \nfor review.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 77 (Jan. 28, 2022).  \u201cAny-\none,\u201d including \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201corganizations,\u201d \u201ccan \nnominate a new topic for Task Force consideration.\u201d  \nIbid. \nAfter the Task Force chooses a topic, creates a re-\nsearch plan, and reviews the evidence, the Task Force \nmay formulate a \u201cdraft recommendation statement\u201d for \na particular preventive service.  D. Ct. Doc. 65, at 81.  \nThe Task Force then posts the \u201cdraft recommendation \nstatement,\u201d along with the relevant \u201cevidence,\u201d on its \nwebsite \u201cfor public comment.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cDuring the com-\nment period, any member of the public may submit com-\nments.\u201d  Ibid.  Based on those comments, the Task Force \nmay \u201cpropose revisions to the recommendation.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n6 \n \nAll Task Force members then vote on the final rec-\nommendation.  See J.A. 50-51.  If adopted, the Task \nForce posts the recommendation on its website.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 81.  The Task Force also publishes its rec-\nommendations \u201cin the Guide to Clinical Preventive Ser-\nvices,\u201d a resource for medical professionals, Congress, \nand other policymakers.  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).   \nWith the 2010 enactment of the ACA, Congress for \nthe first time provided that some of the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations could have binding legal effects.  Spe-\ncifically, the ACA requires health-insurance issuers and \ngroup health plans to cover certain preventive services \nwithout imposing copayments, deductibles, or other \ncost-sharing charges on patients.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13.  \nCongress did not create a fixed list of covered preven-\ntive services, but rather provided for coverage of cate-\ngories of services based on the current recommenda-\ntions of medical experts, including the Task Force.  The \nAct accordingly requires coverage without cost sharing \nfor \u201cevidence-based items or services that have in effect \na rating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of \nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1).1   \n2. The applicable statutes enable secretarial control \nover the Task Force and the process by which its rec-\nommendations may become legally binding.  The Secre-\ntary can appoint Task Force members and has appointed \nthe 16 members currently serving on the Task Force.  \n \n1 The Task Force issues \u201cA\u201d recommendations for services that it \ndeems to have a high certainty of a substantial net benefit; \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations for services that have at least a moderate certainty \nof a moderate net benefit; and \u201cC\u201d recommendations for services \nthat have at least a moderate certainty of a small net benefit.

Task Force members serve \nfour-year terms.  See J.A. 39.  Significantly, the Secre-\ntary can remove them at will before the end of their \nterm, because there are no statutory restrictions on a \nmember\u2019s removal.  See 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a) (2018 & \nSupp. IV 2022).   \nThe ACA also gives the Secretary other powers to \nsupervise Task Force recommendations.  The statute \nprovides that \u201c[t]he Secretary shall establish a mini-\nmum interval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation  * * *  is issued\u201d and the date on which issuers \nand plans must cover the recommended service without \ncost sharing for a new plan year.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(1).  The minimum interval established by the Sec-\nretary \u201cshall not be less than 1 year.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(b)(2).  Under current regulations, the interval for \nmost recommendations is one year.  See 45 C.F.R. \n147.130(b)(1).    \nIn addition, Congress has vested the Secretary with \nsignificant supervisory authority over the Public Health \nService, which includes AHRQ and the Task Force.  In \nReorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, 80 Stat. 1610 (Reor-\nganization Plan), \u201call functions of the Public Health Ser-\nvice\u201d and of its \u201cofficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d \nwere transferred to the Secretary, \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610; \nsee Act of Oct. 19, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 \n(ratifying the Reorganization Plan as law).  Congress \nhas also empowered the Secretary to \u201cmake such provi-\nsions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the per-\nformance of any of the functions transferred to him by \nthe provisions of this reorganization plan by any officer, \nemployee, or agency\u201d of the Public Health Service or \n\n8 \n \nHHS.

The Sec-\nretary is further authorized to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, and to \u201ccarry \nout\u201d AHRQ\u2019s mission and duties by \u201cacting through [its] \nDirector,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 299(a).   \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. The Task Force\u2019s current \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations\u2014which the Secretary has allowed to take effect \nand has since expressly ratified\u2014cover more than 50 \npreventive services.  U.S. Preventive Servs. Task Force, \nA & B Recommendations, https://perma.cc/8398-UNHV.  \nThose services include screenings to detect lung, cervical, \nand colorectal cancer; screenings to detect diabetes; \nstatin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease \nand stroke; physical therapy to prevent falls by older \nadults; and eye ointment to prevent blindness-causing \ninfections in newborns.  Ibid.  Since 2010, millions of \nAmericans have received coverage for such preventive \nservices without cost sharing.  See J.A. 62. \nRespondents are four individuals and two small busi-\nnesses that object to the requirement that health- \ninsurance issuers and group health plans cover certain \npreventive services.  Pet. App. 7a.  Five of the six re-\nspondents \u201cdo not currently participate in the health \ncare market.\u201d  Id. at 62a; see D. Ct. Docs. 111-1, \u00b6 5, \n111-2, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 111-3, \u00b6 5 (Jan. 6, 2023).  They object on \nreligious grounds to the ACA\u2019s requirement that issu-\ners and plans cover certain HIV-prevention medica-\ntions for which the Task Force has issued an \u201cA\u201d rec-\nommendation that has taken effect.  Pet. App. 7a-8a.  \nAnd they wish to purchase or provide health insurance \nthat excludes coverage for such medications consistent \nwith their faiths.  Ibid.   \n\n9 \n \nBraidwood Management is the only respondent that \ncurrently participates in the health-insurance market.  \nPet. App. 55a.  Braidwood offers coverage to its approx-\nimately 70 employees through a self-insured plan.  Ibid.  \nIts owner wishes to exclude from that plan coverage of \ncertain HIV-prevention medications and to \u201cimpose co-\npays or deductibles for preventive care.\u201d  Id. at 55a-56a.   \n2. Respondents filed this suit in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas.  Re-\nspondents prevailed on a claim under the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. \n2000bb et seq., securing a party-specific injunction against \nenforcement of the requirement to cover without cost \nsharing certain HIV-prevention medications.  See Pet. \nApp. 50a, 68a-72a, 84a, 129a-134a.  The government did \nnot appeal that RFRA decision.   \nAs relevant here, respondents also challenged the \nTask Force\u2019s structure as violating the Appointments \nClause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2, because, in their \nview, Task Force members are principal officers of the \nUnited States who have not been appointed by the Pres-\nident with the advice and consent of the Senate.  Pet. \nApp. 8a.  Respondents\u2019 operative complaint seeks in-\njunctive and declaratory relief but does not seek vaca-\ntur under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), \n5 U.S.C. 706(2).  J.A. 31-32.2   \n \n2 Respondents asserted Appointments Clause challenges to two \nother bodies within HHS\u2014the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration (HRSA)\u2014that issue recommendations and guidelines \nthat insurance issuers and group health plans are required to cover \nwithout cost sharing.  See Pet. App. 5a-6a, 8a; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-\n13(a)(2)-(4).  The district court rejected those Appointments Clause \nchallenges, Pet. App. 102a-106a, but the court of appeals reversed \nand remanded for consideration of respondents\u2019 argument that the \n\n10 \n \nThe district court held that Task Force members are \nimproperly appointed principal officers and granted \nsummary judgment to respondents.  Pet. App. 115a.  \nThe court acknowledged that \u201cno statute forbids\u201d the \n\u201cSecretary[] or AHRQ Director from firing any mem-\nber of\u200a\u201d the Task Force.  Id. at 119a.  But the court rea-\nsoned that Task Force members \u201chave no superior,\u201d be-\ncause the Secretary \u201cneither directs nor supervises [the \nTask Force] or its members.\u201d  Id. at 115a-116a.   \nThe district court declined to construe or sever the \nrelevant statutory provision to avoid the identified Ap-\npointments Clause problem.  Pet. App. 80a-82a.  Specif-\nically, the court rejected the government\u2019s argument \nthat the provision rendering Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cindependent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6), should be construed to allow the Secretary \nto review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommenda-\ntions before they bind insurance issuers and group \nhealth plans.  Pet. App. 81a.  The district court recog-\nnized that this Court in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1 (2021), had \u201ccur[ed]\u201d an Appointments Clause \nviolation by severing a statutory provision to ensure \nthat decisions of administrative patent judges (APJs) \nwould \u201cbe subject to the review of the [Patent and \nTrademark Office] Director.\u201d  Pet. App. 81a.  But the \ndistrict court deemed Arthrex \u201cinapplicable\u201d based on \nits view that the Task Force is not \u201csubject to the Sec-\nretary\u2019s \u2018supervision and direction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).   \n \nAPA required public notice and comment for the Secretary\u2019s ratifi-\ncation of ACIP and HRSA recommendations and guidelines, id. at \n43a-47a.  Those separate claims are not before the Court.   \n\n11 \n \nAs a remedy, the district court not only granted \nparty-specific relief, but also ordered \u201c[u]niversal\u201d re-\nlief based on its reading of 5 U.S.C. 706(2), even though \nrespondents had not raised an APA claim in their oper-\native complaint.  Pet. App. 72a (emphasis omitted).  The \ncourt vacated \u201c[a]ll agency action taken to implement or \nenforce the preventive care coverage requirements in \nresponse to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 recommendation by the  * * *  \nTask Force on or after March 23, 2010.\u201d  Id. at 83a.  The \ncourt also granted a nationwide injunction barring the \ngovernment from \u201cimplementing or enforcing\u201d the \nACA\u2019s preventive-services \u201ccoverage requirements in \nresponse to an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 rating from the Task Force in \nthe future.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. The government sought a stay pending appeal of \nthe district court\u2019s universal remedies.  After the court \nof appeals heard oral argument on the government\u2019s \nstay motion, the parties stipulated to a stay of the uni-\nversal remedies, and the court entered a corresponding \nstay.  C.A. Doc. 153-2 (June 13, 2023).   \nIn addition, while the appeal was pending, the Secre-\ntary ratified the AHRQ Director\u2019s appointment of the \ncurrent members of the Task Force and appointed \nthose members himself on a prospective basis.  See Ap-\npointment Ratification, supra.  In January 2022, the \nSecretary had separately ratified all Task Force \u201cA\u201d \nand \u201cB\u201d recommendations then currently in effect.  J.A. \n34-35.  \n4. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s \nholding that the Task Force\u2019s structure violates the Ap-\npointments Clause, but reversed the district court\u2019s \ngrant of universal relief.  Pet. App. 1a-48a.   \na. The court of appeals held that Task Force mem-\nbers are principal officers who had not been properly \nappointed.  Pet. App. 26a.  The court acknowledged that \n\n12 \n \n\u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cperhaps the most impor-\ntant\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Id. at 17a.  And it \n\u201cagree[d] with the Government that the HHS Secretary \nmay remove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Id. at \n18a.  But the court noted that \u201canother important con-\nsideration  * * *  is the extent to which the Task Force\u2019s \nwork can be supervised by a higher-ranking executive \nofficial, like [the HHS] Secretary.\u201d  Id. at 20a.  \n\u201cOn that front,\u201d the court of appeals could not \u201csay \nthat any such supervision exists\u2014as a matter of law or \nreality.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  Citing Section 299b-4(a)(6), the \ncourt took the view that \u201cthe Task Force cannot be \u2018in-\ndependent\u2019 and free from \u2018political pressure\u2019 on the one \nhand, and at the same time be supervised by the HHS \nSecretary, a political appointee, on the other.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court construed \u201c\u200a\u2018independent\u2019\u200a\u201d in Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) to mean \u201cfree from any supervision,\u201d as opposed \nto simply \u201c\u200a\u2018unbiased.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 20a, 21a n.59.  And the \ncourt declined to read Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s phrase, \u201cto \nthe extent practicable,\u201d to give the Secretary a level of \ncontrol necessary to avoid any constitutional problem.  \n42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6); see Pet. App. 21a-23a.   \nThe court of appeals \u201cresolve[d] the competing  \nconsiderations\u201d bearing on the status of Task Force \nmembers\u2014at-will removability coupled with allegedly \nunreviewable authority\u2014\u201cin favor of holding that the \nTask Force members are principal officers.\u201d  Pet. App. \n24a.  The court considered it all but \u201cdispositive\u201d that, \n\u201c[l]ike the [Patent Trial and Appeal Board at issue in \nArthrex], the Task Force can, and does, issue legally bind-\ning decisions without any review by a higher-ranking of-\nficer.\u201d  Ibid.  The court considered inadequate the Sec-\nretary\u2019s \u201cindirect control over the Task Force\u2019s recom-\nmendations through his removal power.\u201d  Id. at 25a. \n\n13 \n \nThe court of appeals also declined to sever Section \n299b-4(a)(6) and allow the Secretary to review Task \nForce \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations on that basis.  Pet. \nApp. 30a-33a.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[i]f [it] \nwere to \u2018sever\u2019 \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6),\u201d the Secretary\u2019s review of \nTask Force recommendations \u201cwould not conflict with \nany other applicable statutory provision.\u201d  Id. at 31a.  \nBut the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d how a \u201cdecision \nto disregard \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) would also thereby empower \nthe Secretary to begin reviewing, and possibly reject-\ning, the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. (foot-\nnote omitted).  The court thus considered itself \u201cunable \nto track the Supreme Court\u2019s severability analysis in \nArthrex,\u201d and held that \u201cwith or without \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), \nthe constitutional problem persists.\u201d  Id. at 32a-33a.  \nb. The court of appeals next held that there \u201cwas no \nbasis\u201d for the district court\u2019s grant of \u201cuniversal reme-\ndies.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.  The court recognized \u201cnotable \nskepticism\u201d about the availability of universal vacatur \nunder the APA, but explained that its precedent \u201chas \nunderstood vacatur under \u00a7 706(2) to be a remedy that \naffects individuals beyond those who are parties to the \nimmediate dispute\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018default\u2019 remedy for un-\nlawful agency action.\u201d  Id. at 34a-36a.   \nThe court of appeals observed, however, that \u201cone of \nthe minimal requirements to be entitled to th[e] \u2018de-\nfault\u2019 APA remedy is, perhaps unsurprisingly, an APA \nclaim.\u201d  Pet. App. 37a.  Because respondents had failed \nto plead an APA claim, the court rejected the \u201cdistrict \ncourt\u2019s decision to vacate all agency actions taken to en-\nforce the Task Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd \u201cwithout any basis to seek universal vacatur,\u201d the \ncourt held that respondents correspondingly \u201clack any \nbasis for an injunction of the same breadth.\u201d  Id. at 42a-\n43a.  The court thus limited the injunction to bar the \n\n14 \n \ngovernment from enforcing the preventive-services-\ncoverage requirements only against respondents.  Id. at \n43a.3   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nInferior officers are those \u201cwhose work is directed \nand supervised at some level by\u201d a principal officer.  Ed-\nmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997).  When \nclassifying an officer as inferior or principal, this Court \n\u201capprais[es]  * * *  how much power [that] officer exer-\ncises free from control by a superior.\u201d  United States v. \nArthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 17 (2021).  In general, an officer will \nbe inferior if he may be removed at will by, and have his \ndecisions reviewed by, a principal officer.   \nMembers of the Task Force fit that bill because they \ncannot make any legally binding final decisions on be-\nhalf of the United States without the Secretary\u2019s per-\nmission.  The Secretary can remove them at will, and \nthe threat of removal is the ultimate tool for control over \nfinal decisions on recommendations.  Moreover, the \nSecretary has separate statutory authorities that allow \nhim to determine whether Task Force recommenda-\ntions should become binding on health-insurance issu-\ners and group health plans and allow him to impose \nother controls.  Task Force members are therefore in-\nferior officers.  In holding otherwise, the court of ap-\npeals overlooked the extent of the Secretary\u2019s control.  \nAt a minimum, the cure for any Appointments Clause \nviolation would be to sever the statutory provision that \n \n3 The separate party-specific injunction arising from respondents\u2019 \nRFRA claims\u2014which bars the government from enforcing against \nrespondents the requirement to cover without cost sharing certain \nHIV-prevention medications\u2014remains in force and will not be af-\nfected by this Court\u2019s resolution of the Appointments Clause issue \nhere.  See p. 9, supra.  \n\n15 \n \nthe court (incorrectly) saw as unduly insulating the \nTask Force from secretarial supervision, not to bar the \nTask Force prospectively from exercising significant \ngovernment authority absent new legislation.  \nI. Task Force members are inferior officers, not \nprincipal officers. \nA. Only an officer properly appointed to a principal \noffice may have \u201cpower to render a final decision on be-\nhalf of the United States\u201d without possible supervision \nby a superior officer.  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665.  A key \nquestion, then, is \u201chow much power\u201d an officer \u201cexer-\ncises free from control by a superior.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. \nat 17. \nWhile various tools may allow a principal officer to \ncontrol an inferior officer\u2019s decisions so that any final, \nbinding decision is the principal\u2019s own, two are particu-\nlarly significant.  First and foremost, the authority to \nremove an officer at will \u201ccarries with it the inherent \npower to direct and supervise.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 537 F.3d 667, 707 \n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting), aff\u200a\u2019d in \npart, rev\u2019d in part, and remanded, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  \nSecond, the authority to \u201creview\u201d an officer\u2019s decisions \nbefore they bind private parties ensures that the supe-\nrior officer is \u201cresponsib[le]\u201d for the decisions \u201cren-\ndered by\u201d the officers \u201cpurportedly under his charge.\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 14-15. \nB.  Here, the Secretary possesses both of those \nmeans of control over Task Force members.  They are \naccordingly inferior officers.   \nAs both lower courts recognized, the Secretary \u201cmay \nremove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. \n18a; see id. at 119a.  That at-will removal authority car-\nries with it the \u201cpower to direct and supervise.\u201d Free \nEnter. Fund, 537 F.3d at 707 (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\n\n16 \n \ning).  For instance, if the Task Force were to reject the \nSecretary\u2019s request to withdraw a particular recom-\nmendation, the Secretary could remove and replace the \nTask Force members.  Through his unfettered removal \npower, the Secretary can effectively ensure that no  \npreventive-services recommendations contrary to the \nSecretary\u2019s judgment will take binding effect.   \nIn addition, the Secretary may directly review\u2014and \ndeny legal force to\u2014Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndations.  He may invoke his authority to \u201cestablish a min-\nimum interval\u201d before \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nbind insurance issuers and group health plans, to allow \ntime for him to conduct further review or request that \nthe Task Force reconsider or modify its recommenda-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1).  That power alone pre-\ncludes Task Force recommendations from having bind-\ning effect without the Secretary\u2019s approval.  And the Sec-\nretary may use his general rulemaking authority to fur-\nther enhance his supervisory role over recommendations \n\u2014for instance, by prescribing procedures by which Task \nForce recommendations shall be reviewed.  The combi-\nnation of the Secretary\u2019s authorities ensures more than \nadequate supervision over the Task Force.   \nC.  The contrary arguments offered by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and respondents lack merit.  The court of appeals \nmisinterpreted Section 299b-4(a)(6) as precluding the \nSecretary from reviewing, and denying binding effect \nto, Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  Section \n299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6).  That language requires that \nTask Force members make recommendations based on \ntheir impartial medical and public-health judgments.  It \ndoes not mean that the Secretary is barred from then \n\n17 \n \ndetermining whether Task Force recommendations will \nbe given legal effect.  That understanding follows natu-\nrally from the rest of the statutory framework, which \nprovides the Secretary substantial authority to oversee \nthe Public Health Service, including the Task Force.  \nAnd it tracks Congress\u2019s longstanding practice of au-\nthorizing inferior-officer adjudicators (such as adminis-\ntrative law judges) to make threshold decisions, while \nsubjecting those decisions to review by superior offic-\ners.   \nRespondents contend that to be constitutional, Sec-\ntion 299b-4(a)(6) must allow the Secretary not only to \nreview Task Force recommendations, but also to direct \nthe substance of those recommendations in the first in-\nstance.  This Court\u2019s precedent does not support that \ncontention.  In Edmond, for instance, the Court held \nthat judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Ap-\npeals were inferior officers where a principal officer \ncould \u201creview[]\u201d their decisions only ex post and could \n\u201cnot attempt to influence  * * *  the outcome of [their] \nindividual\u201d decisions ex ante.  520 U.S. at 664.  What \nmatters is that the Secretary, not the Task Force, is ul-\ntimately responsible for deciding what recommenda-\ntions will have final, binding legal effect.  Regardless, \nrespondents do not explain why the Secretary\u2019s plenary \nremoval authority would not confer additional control \nover recommendations, were such control constitution-\nally required.    \nII.  If the Court nevertheless holds that Task Force \nmembers are unconstitutionally insulated from secre-\ntarial supervision, Section 299b-4(a)(6) should be sev-\nered to cure that defect.  \nA.  This Court\u2019s ordinary practice \u201c\u200a\u2018when confront-\ning a constitutional flaw in a statute\u2019\u200a\u201d is to \u201csever[] any \n\u2018problematic portions while leaving the remainder in-\n\n18 \n \ntact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 508 (2010) (citation omit-\nted).  In Arthrex, for instance, the Court severed the \nstatutory provision that precluded principal-officer re-\nview of APJs\u2019 decisions, without disrupting the rest of \nthe statutory framework.  See 594 U.S. at 24-25.   \nHere, the court of appeals cited only one provision, \nSection 299b-4(a)(6), as unduly insulating Task Force \nrecommendations from secretarial review.  Under this \nCourt\u2019s precedent, the Fifth Circuit should have de-\nclared Section 299b-4(a)(6) unenforceable as applied  \nto Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  And it \nshould have left the statutory framework otherwise \u201cop-\nerative.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25. \nB.  The court of appeals declined to sever Section \n299b-4(a)(6) because it believed that doing so would not \n\u201calso thereby empower the Secretary to begin review-\ning, and possibly rejecting, the Task Force\u2019s recommen-\ndations.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a (footnote omitted).  But that \nview ignores the Secretary\u2019s broad supervisory powers \nover the Task Force, which would allow the Secretary \nto review Task Force recommendations\u2014and deny \nthem binding effect\u2014following the severance of Section \n299b-4(a)(6).  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 24-25.   \nRespondents contend that severing Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) would not cure the constitutional defect because \nthe Secretary would still lack power to review Task \nForce decisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndation.  But they cite no authority holding that the Ap-\npointments Clause requires principal-officer review of a \nsubordinate officer\u2019s inaction\u2014and this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Free Enterprise Fund indicates the opposite.  In \nany event, the Secretary here has multiple ways to en-\nsure that the Task Force will consider particular pro-\nposed recommendations.    \n\n19 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Task Force\u2019s structure comports with the Ap-\npointments Clause because Task Force members are \nvalidly appointed inferior officers.  Task Force mem-\nbers cannot unilaterally render final decisions that have \nlegally binding effect.  Rather, Task Force recommen-\ndations have legal effect only if the Secretary allows \nthem to become final and binding.  Most pointedly, the \nSecretary can control whether Task Force recommen-\ndations take effect by removing Task Force members at \nwill.  The relevant statutory provisions separately ena-\nble the Secretary to review Task Force recommenda-\ntions and determine whether they will become legally \nbinding on insurance issuers and group health plans.  At \na minimum, if any Appointments Clause problem exists, \nthe court of appeals adopted the wrong solution.  The \ncourt should have severed the lone provision that it (in-\ncorrectly) perceived as unduly insulating the Task \nForce from secretarial control.  This Court should re-\nverse.  \nI. TASK FORCE MEMBERS ARE INFERIOR OFFICERS \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedent, Task Force members \nare the Secretary\u2019s subordinates, not principal officers \nin their own right.  The Secretary may remove Task \nForce members at will.  And he may deny binding effect \nto their preventive-services recommendations.  Task \nForce members are thus inferior officers who were val-\nidly appointed by the Secretary, and there is no Ap-\npointments Clause violation.  \n\n20 \n \nA. A Principal Officer\u2019s Power To Remove A Subordinate \nAt Will And To Review The Subordinate\u2019s Decisions \nProvides Constitutionally Adequate Supervision  \n1. \u201cGenerally speaking, the term \u2018inferior officer\u2019 \nconnotes a relationship with some higher ranking officer \nor officers below the President,\u201d because \u201c[w]hether one \nis an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a su-\nperior.\u201d  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 662 \n(1997).  Thus, inferior officers are ordinarily those \u201cwhose \nwork is directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663.  \nTo determine whether a particular officer qualifies \nas inferior, this Court \u201capprais[es]  * * *  how much \npower [that] officer exercises free from control by a su-\nperior.\u201d  United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 17 (2021).  \nSpecifically, the Court asks whether the relevant officer \nhas the statutory \u201cpower to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States\u201d without review \u201cby other \nExecutive officers.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665.  If so, \nthen the officer\u2019s \u201cunreviewable executive power\u201d would \nbe \u201cincompatible with the[] status [of\u200a] inferior officer[].\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 18.  \u201cOnly an officer properly ap-\npointed to a principal office may issue a final decision \nbinding the Executive Branch\u201d without possible super-\nvision by a superior officer.  Id. at 23. \nThe most potent tool by which principal officers can \nexert adequate \u201ccontrol\u201d over inferior officers is \u201c[t]he \npower to remove [an] officer[]\u201d at will.  Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 664.  After all, \u201c[o]nce an officer is appointed, it \nis only the authority that can remove him, and not the \nauthority that appointed him, that he must fear and, in \nthe performance of his functions, obey.\u201d  Bowsher v. \nSynar, 478 U.S. 714, 726 (1986) (citation omitted).  The \n\n21 \n \nofficer\u2019s \u201cpresumed desire to avoid removal\u201d therefore \n\u201ccreates [a] here-and-now subservience.\u201d  Id. at 727 n.5 \n(citation omitted).  As the D.C. Circuit has put the point, \n\u201c[w]ith unfettered removal power, [a principal officer] \nwill have the direct ability to \u2018direct,\u2019 \u2018supervise,\u2019 and \nexert some \u2018control\u2019 over [another officer\u2019s] decisions.\u201d  \nIntercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty \nBd., 684 F.3d 1332, 1341 (2012) (quoting Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 662-664), cert. denied, 569 U.S. 1004 (2013).4   \nAnother critical tool of control is the ability of a prin-\ncipal officer to \u201creview\u201d inferior officers\u2019 decisions be-\nfore they become final.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14.  Ordi-\nnarily, \u201cadequate supervision\u201d by a principal officer \n\u201centails review of decisions issued by inferior officers.\u201d  \nId. at 19.  That ensures that the principal officer is not \n\u201crelieve[d]  * * *  of responsibility for the final decisions \nrendered by\u201d the officers \u201cpurportedly under his charge.\u201d  \nId. at 15.   \n \n4 See also Free Enter.

This Court\u2019s recent Appointments Clause cases \nhave repeatedly rested their analysis on those two \nforms of principal-officer supervision:  at-will removal, \nand review of inferior-officer decisions.  In Edmond, the \nCourt held that judges of the Coast Guard Court of \nCriminal Appeals properly serve as inferior officers.  \n520 U.S. at 666.  In so holding, the Court emphasized \nthat the Judge Advocate General may remove those \njudges \u201cfrom [their] judicial assignment without cause,\u201d \nand that their decisions could be \u201creverse[d]\u201d by \u201can-\nother Executive Branch entity, the Court of Appeals for \nthe Armed Forces.\u201d  Id. at 664. \nSimilarly, in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. Ac-\ncounting Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), this Court \u201cha[d] \nno hesitation in concluding\u201d that members of the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board were inferior of-\nficers once \u201cthe statutory restrictions on the [Securities \nand Exchange] Commission\u2019s power to remove Board \nmembers\u201d had been severed from the statute.  Id. at 510.  \nIn addition to the Commission\u2019s at-will removal power, \nthe Court stressed the \u201cCommission\u2019s other oversight\u201d \nmechanisms, including its abilities to \u201crelieve the Board \nof authority\u201d and to \u201camend Board sanctions.\u201d  Id. at \n504, 510.   \nMost recently, in Arthrex, the Court concluded that \nAPJs could not be deemed inferior officers because they \n\u201chave the \u2018power to render a final decision on behalf of \nthe United States\u2019 without  * * *  review by their nomi-\nnal superior or any other principal officer in the Execu-\ntive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 14 (citation omitted).  The \nCourt distinguished Edmond on the ground that \u201c[w]hat \nwas \u2018significant\u2019 to the outcome there\u2014review by a su-\nperior executive officer\u2014[was] absent\u201d in the statutory \nframework governing APJs.  Ibid. \n\n23 \n \n3. The Fifth Circuit and respondents give insuffi-\ncient weight to at-will removal authority.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cthe \nmost important\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  Respondents have likewise conceded that \u201c[a]t-will \nremoval is the sine qua non of a dependent relation-\nship.\u201d  Resp. C.A. Br. 9.  And the court further \u201cagree[d] \nwith the Government that the HHS Secretary may re-\nmove members of the Task Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. \n18a.  Yet despite the \u201chere-and-now subservience\u201d cre-\nated by at-will removability, Bowsher, 478 U.S. at 727 \nn.5 (citation omitted), the court determined that Task \nForce members are principal officers by reasoning that \nat-will removability by a superior cannot alone suffice \nto make someone an inferior officer.  Pet. App. 19a.   \nThis Court need not resolve that question, because \nthe Secretary has other means of control besides at-will \nremoval.  Regardless, the court of appeals did not iden-\ntify any instance in which at-will removability was held \nto be constitutionally insufficient to render an officer  \ninferior.  And neither the court nor respondents have \nidentified any examples, either in statute or judicial \nprecedent, of officials who were removable at will by \nsomeone other than the President and yet were them-\nselves principal officers required to be appointed by the \nPresident with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.   \nBy contrast, there are countless examples \u201cwhere \nCongress historically has provided for appointment of \nan executive officer by the Head of a Department\u201d and \nmade \u201cclear that the officer was inferior to that princi-\npal officer\u2014because Congress did not prevent the prin-\ncipal officer from removing that inferior officer at will.\u201d  \nFree Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight \nBd., 537 F.3d 667, 705 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting), aff\u200a\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, and remanded, \n\n24 \n \n561 U.S. 477 (2010).  For instance, in 1789, the First \nCongress expressly designated \u201cthe Secretary for the \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs\u201d as \u201ca principal officer,\u201d \nwhile deeming his subordinate, the \u201cchief Clerk,\u201d \u201can \ninferior officer\u201d who was \u201cto be appointed by the said \nprincipal officer\u201d and \u201cto be employed  * * *  as [the Sec-\nretary] shall deem proper.\u201d  Act of July 27, 1789, ch. 4, \n\u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 1 Stat. 28-29; see Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 7, \u00a7 2,  \n1 Stat. 50 (same for the Chief Clerk of the Department \nof War).5  This Court later held that in those \u201cdepart-\nments\u201d in which \u201cpower is given to the secretary[] to \nappoint all necessary clerks,\u201d \u201cthere can be no doubt[] \nthat these clerks hold their office at the will and discre-\ntion of the head of the department.\u201d  In re Hennen, 38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) 230, 259-260 (1839).  That history shows \nthat at-will removal was a key hallmark of inferior- \nofficer status, in keeping with the background constitu-\ntional requirement that those who exercise executive \npower on the President\u2019s behalf must be fully accounta-\nble to the President.   \nMore recently, too, Congress has established im-\nportant federal offices with substantial discretion and \nauthority that have been understood to be inferior of-\nfices in significant part because their occupants may be \nremoved at will by a principal officer.  For example, the \nFederal Open Market Committee within the Federal \nReserve System has final authority over the System\u2019s \n\u201c[o]pen market operations\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe purchase and \n \n5 See also Act of Sept. 2, 1789, ch. 12, \u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 65 (Assistant to \nthe Secretary of the Treasury appointed by and removable at will \nby Secretary of the Treasury); Act of Feb. 20, 1792, ch. 7, \u00a7 3, 1 Stat. \n234 (Deputy Postmasters appointed by and removable at will by \nPostmaster General); Act of Apr. 30, 1798, ch. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 1 Stat. 553-\n554 (Principal Clerk of Navy appointed by and removable at will by \nSecretary of Navy). \n\n25 \n \nsale of Government securities in the domestic securities \nmarket,\u201d through which the System expands or con-\ntracts the supply of money in the United States.

None-\ntheless, certain members of the committee are merely \ninferior officers because they sit alongside members of \nthe Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who lack the \npower to countermand individual committee decisions, \nsee 12 U.S.C. 263(b), but have \u201cthe authority to remove \n[the other committee members] at will.\u201d  Appointment \nand Removal of Federal Reserve Bank Members of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, 43 Op.

Not only may the Secretary \nsupervise Task Force members through his power to \nremove them at will, but he may also directly review\u2014\nand deny binding effect to\u2014their preventive-services \nrecommendations.   \n1. The Secretary may supervise Task Force members \nthrough his at-will removal authority \nAs both the court of appeals and district court recog-\nnized, \u201cthe HHS Secretary may remove members of the \nTask Force at will.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a; see id. at 119a.  That \nconclusion follows from the Secretary\u2019s authority to ap-\npoint Task Force members when \u201cacting through the \nDirector\u201d of AHRQ, 42 U.S.C. 299(a), who normally con-\nvenes the Task Force, 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).

In turn, \u201cthe power of \nremoval of executive officers [i]s incident to the power \nof appointment.\u201d  Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n119 (1926); see Free Enter.

Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 248 (2021).  Similarly, when a statute empowers an \nagency head to appoint an inferior officer and imposes \nno limitations on removal, \u201cthere can be no doubt\u201d that \nthe inferior officer \u201chold[s] [his] office at the will and \n\n27 \n \ndiscretion of the head of the department,\u201d even if \u201cno \npower to remove is expressly given.\u201d  Hennen, 38 U.S. \n(13 Pet.) at 259-260; see, e.g., Reagan v. United States, \n182 U.S. 419, 424, 426-427 (1901).   \nHere, no statutory text protects Task Force mem-\nbers from at-will removal by the Secretary.  That stat-\nutory silence establishes that Task Force members \nserve at the Secretary\u2019s pleasure.  The structure of the \nTask Force is consistent with the \u201chistorical[]\u201d model \nfor inferior officers.  Free Enter. Fund, 537 F.3d at 705 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  Congress has allowed a \nmeans for appointment of Task Force members by a \nSenate-confirmed \u201cHead of a Department\u201d\u2014here, the \nSecretary\u2014and \u201cdid not prevent\u201d the Secretary \u201cfrom \nremoving\u201d Task Force members \u201cat will.\u201d  Ibid.  As a \nresult, it should be \u201cclear\u201d that Task Force members \nare subordinate to the Secretary.  Ibid. \nThe Secretary\u2019s ability to remove Task Force mem-\nbers at will ensures that they cannot exercise significant \npower \u201cfree from control by a superior,\u201d let alone issue \nbinding recommendations or make other decisions with-\nout the Secretary\u2019s review.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 17.   \nFor instance, the Secretary could suggest that the  \nTask Force consider a particular topic for a preventive- \nservices recommendation and remove Task Force mem-\nbers if they declined to take up his proposal.  See D. Ct. \nDoc. 65, at 77 (explaining that \u201canyone can nominate  \n* * *  new topics for the Task Force to consider\u201d).  The \nSecretary could request or direct the Task Force not to \npublish an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation that he does not \nsupport.  And the Secretary could request the Task \nForce to reconsider a recommendation he believed to be \nunsound.  Ultimately, if he found it appropriate, he could \nremove and replace Task Force members and request \nthat the reconstituted Task Force modify or rescind a \n\n28 \n \nrecommendation before he sets an effective date for \nthat recommendation.   \n2. The Secretary may also deny binding effect to the \nTask Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nIn addition to removing Task Force members at will, \nthe Secretary may supervise and review their recom-\nmendations directly.   \nAs an initial matter, the Secretary can exercise con-\ntrol over Task Force recommendations through his au-\nthority to \u201cestablish a minimum interval\u201d before \u201cA\u201d \nand \u201cB\u201d recommendations become \u201ceffective.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(b)(1).  In other words, the Secretary controls \nwhether and when recommendations have binding legal \neffect.  Even if the Secretary has established a general \nminimum interval, he could set a longer interval for a \nrecommendation about which he has concerns and re-\nquest that the Task Force study that recommendation \nfurther (perhaps through additional public and profes-\nsional input), consider modifying it, or direct others in \nthe Public Health Service to evaluate it.  In the mean-\ntime, insurance issuers and group health plans would \nhave no binding obligation to cover the recommended \nservice without cost sharing.   \nBeyond the Secretary\u2019s authority to establish when \nrecommendations become binding, Congress has broadly \nempowered the Secretary to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, which includes \nthe Task Force.  The Secretary also may perform \u201call \nfunctions of the Public Health Service\u201d and its \u201coffic-\ners,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d and \u201cmake such pro-\nvisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the \nperformance of any of the functions  * * *  of the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d  Reorganization Plan \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 \nStat. 1610. \n\n29 \n \nThose authorities would furnish the Secretary with \nadditional means to review the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \n\u201cB\u201d recommendations and determine whether they \nshould become legally binding on issuers and plans.  If \nthe Secretary \u201cdirect[s]\u201d that a recommendation should \nnot be given binding effect, 42 U.S.C. 202, then issuers \nand plans would not be required to cover it without cost \nsharing.  See 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1) (requiring cover-\nage only of \u201citems or services that have in effect a rating \nof \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 in the current recommendations of the\u201d \nTask Force) (emphasis added). \nFinally, the Secretary may use his general regula-\ntory authority to ensure additional supervision over \nTask Force recommendations.  See 42 U.S.C. 202; 42 \nU.S.C. 300gg-92; Reorganization Plan \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. \n1610.  He could, for example, prescribe procedures for \nthe Task Force\u2019s consideration of recommendations \nabout certain services, or provide that the Task Force \nbe required to consider proposals that he submits him-\nself or through the components in the Public Health \nService.  And he could provide for a preclearance re-\ngime under which the Task Force must notify the Sec-\nretary before it votes on a final \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommen-\ndation, and no such recommendations would take bind-\ning effect absent his affirmative approval, had other \nmeasures not proved sufficient to accomplish that.   \n3. The Secretary\u2019s combined authorities provide more \nthan enough supervision over the Task Force \nAs just explained, the Secretary possesses both \nforms of supervisory authority that this Court has \ndeemed critical: the power to remove Task Force mem-\nbers at will and the power to review their recommenda-\ntions before they bind private parties.  This case thus \nfalls neatly within Edmond.  There, as here, judges on \n\n30 \n \nthe Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals could be re-\nmoved by a principal officer from assignments \u201cwithout \ncause,\u201d and a higher appellate court could \u201creverse\u201d their \n\u201cdecisions.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664.  Just as those \njudges were inferior officers, so are Task Force mem-\nbers.   \nArthrex confirms that conclusion.  There, after find-\ning the statutory framework unconstitutional, the Court \ncured the violation by severing only the provision that \n\u201cprevent[ed] the [principal officer] from reviewing final \ndecisions\u201d of APJs.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  The Court \nleft intact the provision that insulated APJs from re-\nmoval by the agency head only \u201cfor such cause as will \npromote the efficiency of the service.\u201d  Id. at 26 (quoting \n5 U.S.C. 7513(a)); see ibid. (declining to adopt the court \nof appeals\u2019 approach of severing \u201cthe for-cause provi-\nsion\u201d).  Here, the statute allows both principal-officer \nreview and at-will removability, so Task Force mem-\nbers are plainly inferior officers. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Advanced By The Court Of Ap-\npeals And Respondents Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals nonetheless held that \u201cTask \nForce members are principal officers.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  \nIn so holding, the court misconstrued Section 299b-\n4(a)(6) as precluding secretarial review of Task Force \nrecommendations.  And respondents err in contending \nthat the Appointments Clause requires that the Secre-\ntary have power not only to review Task Force recom-\nmendations, but also to direct those recommendations \nin the first instance.   \n\n31 \n \n1. The court of appeals erroneously concluded that  \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) precludes the Secretary from re-\nviewing Task Force recommendations \nThe court of appeals concluded that, even though \n\u201cTask Force members are subject to at-will removal by \nthe HHS Secretary,\u201d they are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d be-\ncause (in the court\u2019s view) their \u201c\u200a\u2018recommendations\u2019  \non legally mandated coverage of preventive care go  \nunreviewed\u2014and are unreviewable\u2014by a higher-rank-\ning officer.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  As explained above, see pp. \n28-29, supra, that conclusion misinterprets the relevant \nstatutory provisions as precluding secretarial review of \nTask Force \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  While the \ncourt briefly acknowledged the Secretary\u2019s background \npowers over the Public Health Service, it believed they \ncould not \u201coverride\u201d Section 299b-4(a)(6), Pet. App. 30a, \nwhich provides that Task Force members and their rec-\nommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to the extent \npracticable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6).  The court read the term \u201cindependent\u201d in \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) to mean \u201cdecisionmaking without \nsupervision\u201d and \u201ccomplete autonomy.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a, \n21a n.59.   \na. That reading is incorrect.  Nothing in Section \n299b-4(a)(6) bars the Secretary from reviewing, and de-\nciding whether to deny binding effect to, Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations\u2014and a contrary reading \nwould raise unnecessary constitutional concerns.  Most \nnaturally understood, Section 299b-4(a)(6) does not ad-\ndress the relationship of the Task Force to HHS at all.  \nRather, by requiring that Task Force members and \ntheir recommendations be \u201cindependent and, to the ex-\ntent practicable, not subject to political pressure,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6), Section 299b-4(a)(6) clarifies that \n\n32 \n \nthe members must exercise their own best medical and \npublic-health judgments, must not regard themselves \nas mere representatives of the organizations or profes-\nsions in which they serve, and must not be influenced by \noutside pressures.  See also 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1) (re-\nquiring that recommendations be based on relevant \n\u201cscientific evidence\u201d).   \nBut even if Section 299b-4(a)(6) is also understood as \naddressing the relationship of the Task Force to HHS, \nit still does not support the court of appeals\u2019 holding \nhere.  The statutory requirements of \u201cindependen[ce]\u201d \nand freedom from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d do not preclude \nthe Secretary from denying binding effect to Task \nForce \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations.  42 U.S.C. 299b-\n4(a)(6).  Contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning, the \nmore natural reading of \u201cindependent\u201d is \u201cbeing or act-\ning free of the influence of something else,\u201d \u201cnot looking \nto others for one\u2019s opinions,\u201d and \u201cacting or thinking \nfreely.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary \nof the English Language 1148 (1993) (emphasis added); \nsee The American Heritage Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 917 (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cFree from the influence\u201d \nor \u201cguidance\u201d of others).   \nThus, although the statutory requirement of inde-\npendence might be read as suggesting that Task Force \nmembers\u2019 recommendations must be unreviewable, it is \nbetter read as meaning only that Task Force members\u2019 \nconsideration of proposed recommendations must be \nguided by the members\u2019 expert and impartial judgment.  \nAfter all, the text first provides that the members shall \nbe independent, which focuses on the individual mem-\nbers\u2019 participation on the Task Force.  And the Task \nForce then produces recommendations, which will by \ndefinition have operative effect only if they are adopted \nby someone else.  Under the latter of the two meanings \n\n33 \n \nidentified above, then, the Secretary may still review \nTask Force recommendations, even though the Task \nForce members initially formed them impartially.   \nb. Statutory context further supports the govern-\nment\u2019s reading.  See Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) (\u201c[T]he Court \nmust read the words Congress enacted \u2018in their context \nand with a view to their place in the overall statutory \nscheme.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation omitted).  The relevant statutory \nprovisions afford the Secretary broad supervisory pow-\ners over the Task Force and allow him to remove Task \nForce members for any reason\u2014including because they \nrefused to consider a recommendation the Secretary \nproposed or issued one that the Secretary found un-\nsound.  Given those means of secretarial control, it would \nbe incongruous to interpret Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s ref-\nerence to independence as \u201ca clear and express direc-\ntive from Congress that the Task Force be free from \nany supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a (emphasis added).   \nCongress\u2019s longstanding practice of vesting inde-\npendent decision-making authority in inferior-officer \nadjudicators further confirms that independence in \nforming initial decisions can be compatible with inferior-\nofficer status.  As the Court observed in Arthrex, while \n\u201cinferior adjudicative officers\u201d are expected to issue in-\ndependent decisions, \u201cit \u2018certainly is the norm\u2019 for prin-\ncipal officers to have the capacity to review [those] de-\ncisions.\u201d  594 U.S. at 20 (citation omitted); see id. at 25 \n(referring to that approach as \u201cthe almost-universal \nmodel of adjudication in the Executive Branch\u201d); Lucia \nv. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 242 (2018) (explaining that the Se-\ncurities and Exchange Commission may \u201creview the \n[Administrative Law Judge\u2019s] decision\u201d).  Administra-\ntive law judges are therefore properly regarded as infe-\nrior officers, because principal officers retain other  \n\n34 \n \ncontrols\u2014including the power to determine what deci-\nsions become final and binding.  Bandimere v. SEC, 844 \nF.3d 1168, 1179 (10th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 585 U.S. \n1035 (2018); see also 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(d)(7)(i) and (h) (al-\nlowing the Attorney General to review decisions of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals).  \nLikewise, the \u201cspecial trial judges\u201d of the Tax Court \nat issue in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991), \n\u201cexercise significant discretion\u201d and \u201cindependent au-\nthority\u201d when adjudicating certain proceedings, id. at \n882.  But they do so only \u201csubject to such conditions and \nreview as the [Tax Court] may provide.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n7443A(c); see Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 20.  Accordingly, this \nCourt held that the special trial judges are inferior of-\nficers.  Freytag, 501 U.S. at 882. \nThus, under the Appointments Clause, Congress \nmay permissibly provide for an initial \u201cimpartial deci-\nsion by a panel of experts,\u201d followed by a final \u201ctrans-\nparent decision for which a politically accountable of-\nficer must take responsibility.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 16.  \nAnd, again, at-will removal provides yet further control \nover the Task Force.   \nc. The court of appeals emphasized Congress\u2019s in-\nstruction that Task Force members and their recom-\nmendations not be \u201csubject to political pressure,\u201d \u201cto \nthe extent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6); see Pet. \nApp. 20a.  According to the court, if the Secretary may \ndeny binding effect to Task Force members\u2019 recommen-\ndations, \u201cthen the Task Force would have no political \nindependence at all, contrary to the terms of the provi-\nsion.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that the Secretary has unfettered, at-will re-\nmoval authority over the Task Force.  Such authority \nincludes the power to remove Task Force members if \nthey refuse to withdraw proposed recommendations\u2014\n\n35 \n \nthus preventing recommendations from taking effect\u2014\nand it is difficult to see why Section 299b-4(a)(6) would \ncabin other secretarial powers but not the most potent \npower of removal.  Moreover, as just explained, Con-\ngress has directed several categories of inferior officers \nto make decisions using independent judgment, while at \nthe same time subjecting those decisions to review by \npresidentially appointed principal officers.   \nIn any event, Section 299b-4(a)(6) explicitly qualifies \nthe requirement of freedom from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d \nwith the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n299b-4(a)(6).  If greater secretarial supervision over \nTask Force recommendations is constitutionally neces-\nsary, then the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d can be \nreadily interpreted to allow it.  This Court will construe \na statute to \u201cavoid\u201d a substantial question whether the \nstatute is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d if \u201cthere is another reason-\nable interpretation available.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at \n658.  Here, Congress plainly intended to allow a saving \nconstruction, if necessary, by qualifying the limitation \non political pressure with the flexible phrase \u201cto the ex-\ntent practicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals declined to adopt that construc-\ntion because the court thought it would raise a \u201cline-\ndrawing problem\u201d when determining which Task Force \n\u201crecommendations\u201d would be subject to secretarial re-\nview.  Pet. App. 22a.  But there is no mystery about \nwhere to draw the line.  Any additional constitutionally \nnecessary review will apply only to the \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations because they are the only ones that can \nhave binding effects on private parties.  See 42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1).  Accordingly, only those recommenda-\ntions involve the exercise of \u201csignificant authority pur-\nsuant to the laws of the United States\u201d that makes Task \nForce members federal officers in the first place.  Ar-\n\n36 \n \nthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1, 126 (1976) (per curiam)).  The Task Force\u2019s nonbind-\ning recommendations (such as its \u201cC\u201d recommenda-\ntions) would require no additional secretarial supervi-\nsion, because they involve no significant exercise of fed-\neral power.  See id. at 14 (evaluating supervision only of \nthe powers \u201cthat make[] the APJs officers exercising \n\u2018significant authority\u2019 in the first place\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nThe court of appeals also suggested that the govern-\nment\u2019s reading of Section 299b-4(a)(6) is \u201cinconsistent,\u201d \nPet. App. 23a, with Section 300gg-13(b)(1)\u2019s require-\nment that the Secretary \u201cestablish a minimum interval \nbetween the date on which\u201d the Task Force assigns an \n\u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating to a preventive service and the date \non which issuers and plans must cover that service with-\nout cost sharing, 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(b)(1).  That provi-\nsion serves in part to give issuers and plans time to in-\ncorporate preventive services for the next policy or plan \nyear.  But the Secretary\u2019s authority to establish such an \ninterval for that purpose does not deny the Secretary \nthe ability to invoke that authority for the additional \npurpose of allowing him time to review\u2014and then deny \nbinding effect to\u2014recommendations, or to remove and \nreplace the Task Force members who issued them. \n2. Respondents erroneously contend that the Appoint-\nments Clause requires that the Secretary have power \nto direct recommendations \nRespondents contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 30-31) \nthat to be constitutional, Section 299b-4(a)(6) must al-\nlow the Secretary not only to review Task Force recom-\nmendations, but also to direct the substance of those \nrecommendations in the first instance.  Notably, the \nFifth Circuit did not endorse that argument.  Instead, \n\n37 \n \nit suggested that if the Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d rec-\nommendations were \u201c[]reviewable\u201d by the Secretary, \nthen Task Force members would be inferior officers.  \nPet. App. 24a.  The court simply believed\u2014incorrectly\n\u2014that Section 299b-4(a)(6) precludes such review. \nRespondents err in contending that secretarial power \nto direct recommendations is also constitutionally re-\nquired.  So long as the Secretary may determine wheth-\ner recommendations bind private parties, he bears \u201cre-\nsponsibility for the final decisions rendered\u201d by the \nTask Force members \u201cunder his charge.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 \nU.S. at 15.  In turn, the President can \u201cattribute\u201d the \nTask Force\u2019s decisions to a principal officer \u201cwhom he \ncan oversee.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 496 (em-\nphasis omitted).  And the public is not left to \u201cwonder \n\u2018on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious \nmeasure, or series of pernicious measures ought really \nto fall.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 16 (quoting The Federalist \nNo. 70, at 476 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke \ned., 1961)).  The Secretary can control Task Force rec-\nommendations by removing or threatening to remove \nTask Force members at will, by preventing recommen-\ndations from having final, binding effect, and by pre-\nscribing procedures to govern the recommendations \nprocess, among other means.  The Appointments Clause \ndoes not require more.   \nIn Edmond, for example, this Court held that judges \nof the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals were in-\nferior officers even though no superior could \u201cattempt \nto influence (by threat of removal or otherwise) the out-\ncome of individual proceedings.\u201d  520 U.S. at 664.  The \nCourt explained that \u201c[w]hat [wa]s significant\u201d was that \nthe judges had \u201cno power to render a final decision on \nbehalf of the United States unless permitted to do so \nby\u201d a superior officer.  Id. at 665 (emphasis added).  And \n\n38 \n \nthe Court emphasized that even though a principal of-\nficer could not direct the judges\u2019 decisions ex ante, an \n\u201cExecutive Branch entity\u201d could \u201creverse [those] deci-\nsions\u201d after the fact.  Id. at 664.  Under Edmond, it is \nsignificant that a principal officer may review\u2014and \nthen decide to deny binding effect to\u2014an inferior of-\nficer\u2019s decision.  The principal officer need not also have \nthe power to direct the inferior officer\u2019s decision in the \nfirst place.  \nThat principle traces back to this Court\u2019s decision in \nMyers.  There, in discussing the President\u2019s removal \npower, the Court explained that \u201cthere may be duties of \na quasi-judicial character imposed on executive officers \nand members of executive tribunals  * * *  the discharge \nof which the President can not in a particular case \nproperly influence or control.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 135.  \nBut the Court saw no constitutional problem with that \nstructure because the President \u201cmay consider the de-\ncision after its rendition as a reason for removing the \nofficer, on the ground that the discretion regularly en-\ntrusted to that officer by statute has not been on the \nwhole intelligently or wisely exercised.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nsame logic applies here:  Even if the Secretary could not \n\u201cinfluence or control\u201d Task Force recommendations ex \nante, but see p. 27, supra, he may review those decisions \nafter they are issued, deny them binding effect, and con-\nsider them \u201cas a reason for removing\u201d Task Force mem-\nbers, Myers, 272 U.S. at 135.   \nII. ANY APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE VIOLATION MAY BE \nCURED BY SEVERING SECTION 299b-4(a)(6) \nEven if this Court were to conclude that the Task \nForce is unduly insulated from secretarial supervision, \nthe proper course would be to sever the provision cre-\nating such insulation.  The court of appeals erred in de-\n\n39 \n \nclining to do so and instead prospectively barred the \nTask Force from issuing \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations \nthat may create binding coverage obligations\u2014at least \nabsent new legislation.   \nA. Severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) Would Eliminate The \nOnly Constitutional Flaw The Fifth Circuit Identified \n\u201c\u200a\u2018Generally speaking, when confronting a constitu-\ntional flaw in a statute, [the Court] tr[ies] to limit the \nsolution to the problem,\u2019 severing any \u2018problematic por-\ntions while leaving the remainder intact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 508 (citation omitted).  That approach \nstems from the Judiciary\u2019s \u201cnegative power to disregard \nan unconstitutional enactment\u201d in resolving a legal dis-\npute.  Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923).  \nAnd \u201c[b]ecause \u2018the unconstitutionality of a part of an \nAct does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of \nits remaining provisions,\u2019 the \u2018normal rule\u2019 is \u2018that par-\ntial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required \ncourse.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 508 (citations \nand brackets omitted).  Indeed, it has been \u201cfirmly es-\ntablished since Marbury v. Madison\u201d that \u201ceven in the \nabsence of a severability clause\u201d courts should opt \u201cfor \nsurgical severance rather than wholesale destruction\u201d \nwhen they find constitutional flaws in Congress\u2019s work.  \nBarr v. American Ass\u2019n of Political Consultants, Inc., \n591 U.S. 610, 626 (2020) (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.).   \nThus, in Arthrex, this Court deemed the constitu-\ntional problem to be that the \u201cunreviewable authority\u201d \nof APJs was \u201cincompatible with their appointment by \nthe Secretary [of Commerce] to an inferior office.\u201d  594 \nU.S. at 23.  The Court fixed that problem by determin-\ning that the statute \u201ccannot constitutionally be enforced \nto the extent that its requirements prevent the [Patent \nand Trademark Office] Director from reviewing final \n\n40 \n \ndecisions rendered by APJs.\u201d  Id. at 25.7  The Court \ntherefore \u201csever[ed]\u201d the provision \u201cshielding\u201d the \nAPJs\u2019 decisions \u201cfrom review\u201d by the Director.  Id. at \n24.  Without that provision, the Court reasoned, \u201cthe Di-\nrector has the authority to provide for a means of re-\nviewing\u201d the relevant decisions \u201c[b]ecause Congress \nhas vested the Director with the \u2018power and duties\u2019 of \nthe [Patent and Trademark Office].\u201d  Id. at 25 (citation \nomitted).  Accordingly, the Court held that, following \nseverance, the Director \u201cmay review\u201d APJs\u2019 decisions \nand that the statute \u201cotherwise remains operative.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThe same logic applies here.  The court of appeals \nidentified the constitutional defect as the absence of a \n\u201csupervisory role for the Secretary\u201d over \u201cthe Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  And the court \npinpointed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s requirement that rec-\nommendations \u201cbe \u2018independent\u2019 and free from \u2018political \npressure\u2019\u200a\u201d as the source of that defect.  Id. at 20a; see \nid. at 23a.  The fix therefore should have been to sever \nSection 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to Task Force \u201cA\u201d and \n\u201cB\u201d recommendations, thus giving the Secretary \u201cau-\nthority to provide for a means of reviewing\u201d those rec-\nommendations.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  And the court \nshould have left the statutory scheme otherwise \u201coper-\native,\u201d ibid.\u2014particularly because it is not \u201c\u200a\u2018evident\u2019\u200a\u201d \nthat if Congress had been \u201cfaced with the limitations \nimposed by the Constitution,\u201d it \u201cwould have preferred\u201d \n \n7 The severability portion of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion was joined \nby Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 4.  \nJustice Breyer issued an opinion concurring in part and dissenting \nin part, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, which \u201cagree[d] \nwith [the] remedial holding\u201d of the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion.  Id. at 44.  \nThus, seven Members of the Court concurred in the severability \nanalysis.   \n\n41 \n \na Task Force without any authority to issue preventive-\nservices recommendations that may bind issuers and \nplans over a Task Force whose recommendations are \nreviewed by the Secretary before they become binding, \nFree Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 509 (citation omitted).   \nB. The Severability Analysis Offered By The Court Of Ap-\npeals And Respondents Is Flawed \n1. The court of appeals \u201cagree[d] with the Govern-\nment\u201d that severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) would ensure \nsecretarial supervision of the Task Force.  Pet. App. \n31a.  But the court found that a \u201cdecision to disregard \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d would not \u201calso thereby empower the Sec-\nretary to begin reviewing, and possibly rejecting, the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendations.\u201d  Ibid.  (footnote omit-\nted).  Although the court recognized that \u201c[s]uch secre-\ntarial review would not conflict with any other applica-\nble statutory provision,\u201d the court saw no affirmative \n\u201cpower to review the recommendations.\u201d  Ibid. \nThat reasoning conflicts with Arthrex.  As noted, the \nCourt there held that after severing the offending pro-\nvision, the Patent and Trademark Office Director \u201cha[d] \nthe authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u201d the \nrelevant APJ decisions.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 25.  In so \nholding, the Court relied on a general provision \u201cvest[ing] \nthe Director with the \u2018powers and duties\u2019 of the [Patent \nand Trademark Office]\u201d and emphasized that \u201c[a] single \nofficer has\u201d long \u201csuperintended the activities of\u200a\u201d that \noffice.  Id. at 24 (citation omitted).  Likewise here, the \nSecretary has the power to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. 202, as well as the \npower to perform \u201call functions of the Public Health \nService\u201d and its \u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cagencies,\u201d Reorganiza-\ntion Plan \u00a7 1(a), 80 Stat. 1610.  And the Secretary has \nsuperintended the Public Health Service\u2019s activities \n\n42 \n \nsince the Reorganization Plan was promulgated in 1966.  \nSee 80 Stat. 1610.  Under Arthrex, the Secretary\u2019s long-\nstanding background authority to supervise and per-\nform the Public Health Service\u2019s functions would com-\nfortably provide for secretarial review of Task Force \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations following the severance \nof Section 299b-4(a)(6).   \nThe court of appeals reasoned that it could not \n\u201ctrack\u201d the \u201cseverability analysis in Arthrex\u201d because, \nin the court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]here are no fallback provisions \non which [the Secretary] can rely to exercise a supervi-\nsory power.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a.  But Section 202 expressly \nempowers the Secretary to \u201csupervis[e] and direct[]\u201d \nthe Public Health Service.  42 U.S.C. 202.  It is therefore \nprecisely the type of \u201cfallback provision[]\u201d that the \ncourt of appeals recognized would be sufficient to per-\nmit principal-officer review.  Pet. App. 32a.   \nThe court of appeals focused instead on the Reorgan-\nization Plan\u2014but it misunderstood that plan\u2019s opera-\ntion.  See Pet. App. 31a-32a.  The Reorganization Plan \nallows the Secretary to exercise power over \u201call func-\ntions of the Public Health Service,\u201d though it creates an \nexception for \u201cthe functions vested by law in any advi-\nsory council, board, or committee of or in the Public \nHealth Service.\u201d  \u00a7 1, 80 Stat. 1610.  The court believed \nthat the exception applies to the Task Force and that \nthe Secretary therefore lacks power over the Task \nForce.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.   \nBut that exception does not apply to the Task Force.  \nInstead, it applies to federal advisory committees or \ncouncils that have purely recommendatory duties, like \nthe Surgeon General\u2019s advisory committee that issued a \nlandmark report on the health effects of smoking just \ntwo years before the Reorganization Plan\u2019s adoption.  \nSee Pub. Health Serv., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health, Educ., & \n\n43 \n \nWelfare, Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory \nCommittee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health \nService (1964), https://perma.cc/8YPT-M9MB.  Indeed, \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), Pub. L. \nNo. 92-463, 86 Stat. 770 (1972), enacted shortly after the \nReorganization Plan, uses similar terminology, refer-\nring to \u201ccommittees, boards, commissions, councils, and \nsimilar groups which have been established to advise of-\nficers and agencies in the executive branch\u201d and whose \nfunction is \u201cadvisory only.\u201d  \u00a7\u00a7 2(a) and (b)(6), 86 Stat. \n770; see 5 U.S.C. 1002(a) and (b)(6) (Supp. IV 2022).   \nThe Task Force is not an advisory body covered by \nthe Reorganization Plan\u2019s exception.  Congress has ex-\npressly provided that \u201cthe Task Force is not subject to \n[FACA].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(5) (Supp. IV 2022).  And \nthe Task Force\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations are not \nadvisory, since the ACA made them binding on private \ninsurance issuers and group health plans.  42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1).  The court of appeals offered no reason \nwhy Congress would create a body that HHS\u2014through \nAHRQ\u2014convenes, provide for its decisions to bind the \npublic, and yet choose not to allow the Secretary to \noversee that body despite vesting the Secretary with all \nother authority in the Public Health Service.  The more \nnatural reading is that Congress authorized the Secre-\ntary to oversee the Task Force, just as the Secretary \noversees all the components of the Public Health Ser-\nvice that perform significant federal functions.   \n2. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the Reorganization Plan\u2019s exception.  In-\nstead, they contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 33) that sev-\nering Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not cure the constitu-\ntional defect because the Secretary would still lack the \n\u201cability to review or countermand [the Task Force\u2019s] de-\ncisions not to adopt an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 recommendation.\u201d  But \n\n44 \n \nrespondents offer no authority for the proposition that \nprincipal-officer review over a subordinate\u2019s inaction is \nnecessary to satisfy the Appointments Clause.  In Free \nEnterprise Fund, for instance, it was enough that the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission could remove \nmembers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard \u201cat will\u201d and exercise \u201cother oversight author-\nity.\u201d  561 U.S. at 510.  The Court did not suggest that \nthe Commission must also have power to review Board \ndecisions not to conduct investigations or bring enforce-\nment actions; in fact, the Court acknowledged that the \nrelevant statute \u201cnowhere g[ave] the Commission effec-\ntive power to start, stop, or alter individual Board in-\nvestigations.\u201d  Id. at 504.  \nRegardless, the Secretary has authority to ensure \nthat the Task Force considers issuing particular recom-\nmendations.  The Secretary may propose a recommen-\ndation topic and remove Task Force members if they \nrefuse to consider it.  And the Secretary may issue reg-\nulations mandating certain recommendation priorities.  \nTaking a different tack, respondents object (Br. in \nSupport of Cert. 33-34) to the entire enterprise of sev-\nerability.  But \u201capart from some isolated detours,\u201d this \n\u201cCourt\u2019s power and preference\u201d to \u201cinvalidate a statute\u201d \nonly \u201cpartially\u201d has remained constant \u201c[f\u200a]rom Marbury \nv. Madison to the present.\u201d  American Ass\u2019n of Politi-\ncal Consultants, 591 U.S. at 626 (opinion of Kavanaugh, \nJ.).  As Chief Justice Marshall explained long ago, if any \npart of an act is \u201cunconstitutional, the provisions of that \npart may be disregarded while full effect will be given \nto such as are not repugnant to the constitution of the \nUnited States.\u201d  Bank of Hamilton v. Lessee of Am-\nbrose Dudley, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 492, 526 (1829); see also \nLoeb v. Columbia Township Trustees, 179 U.S. 472, 490 \n(1900) (\u201c[O]ne section of a statute may be repugnant to \n\n45 \n \nthe Constitution without rendering the whole act void.\u201d).  \nThe Court has consistently applied that approach in \nevery recent separation-of-powers decision that identi-\nfied constitutional defects.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 23-27; \nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 234-238 (2020) \n(opinion of Roberts, C.J.); Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 508-510.  If the Court believes that the Task Force\u2019s \ncurrent structure is unconstitutional, the Court should \napply its traditional severability principles. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nSEAN R.

Such Task Force \nshall review the scientific evidence related to the ef-\nfectiveness, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness \nof clinical preventive services for the purpose of de-\nveloping recommendations for the health care com-\nmunity, and updating previous clinical preventive \nrecommendations, to be published in the Guide to \n\n2a \n \nClinical Preventive Services (referred to in this sec-\ntion as the \u2018\u2018Guide\u2019\u2019), for individuals and organiza-\ntions delivering clinical services, including primary \ncare professionals, health care systems, professional \nsocieties, employers, community organizations, non-\nprofit organizations, Congress and other policy-mak-\ners, governmental public health agencies, health care \nquality organizations, and organizations developing \nnational health objectives.  Such recommendations \nshall consider clinical preventive best practice rec-\nommendations from the Agency for Healthcare Re-\nsearch and Quality, the National Institutes of Health, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nInstitute of Medicine, specialty medical associations, \npatient groups, and scientific societies. \n(2) Duties \n \nThe duties of the Task Force shall include\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe development of additional topic areas \nfor new recommendations and interventions re-\nlated to those topic areas, including those related \nto specific sub-populations and age groups; \n \n(B) \nat least once during every 5-year period, \nreview1 interventions and update2 recommenda-\ntions related to existing topic areas, including new \nor improved techniques to assess the health ef-\nfects of interventions; \n \n(C) \nimproved integration with Federal Gov-\nernment health objectives and related target set-\nting for health improvement; \n \n1  So in original.

For purposes of this paragraph, primary care \nresearch focuses on the first contact when illness or \nhealth concerns arise, the diagnosis, treatment or re-\nferral to specialty care, preventive care, and the re-\nlationship between the clinician and the patient in the \ncontext of the family and community. \n \n4  So in original. \n\n5a \n \n(2) Research \n \nIn carrying out this section, the Center shall con-\nduct and support research concerning\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe nature and characteristics of primary \ncare practice; \n \n(B) \nthe management of commonly occurring \nclinical problems; \n \n(C) \nthe management of undifferentiated clin-\nical problems; and \n \n(D) \nthe continuity and coordination of health \nservices. \n \n3. \n42 U.S.C. 300gg-13 provides: \nCoverage of preventive health services \n(a) \nIn general \nA group health plan and a health insurance issuer of-\nfering group or individual health insurance coverage \nshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not \nimpose any cost sharing requirements for\u2014 \n \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have in \neffect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current recom-\nmendations of the United States Preventive Services \nTask Force; \n \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on Immun-\nization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control \n\n6a \n \nand Prevention with respect to the individual in-\nvolved; and1 \n \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and adoles-\ncents, evidence-informed preventive care and screen-\nings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Ad-\nministration.2 \n \n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in para-\ngraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive guide-\nlines supported by the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration for purposes of this paragraph.2 \n \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preventive \nService Task Force regarding breast cancer screen-\ning, mammography, and prevention shall be consid-\nered the most current other than those issued in or \naround November 2009. \nNothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit \na plan or issuer from providing coverage for services in \naddition to those recommended by United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force or to deny coverage for ser-\nvices that are not recommended by such Task Force. \n \n \n \n1  So in original.  The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n2  So in original.

This new observation, an act of internal reasoning, does not introduce new external evidence but serves to formalize and crystallize the conclusions drawn from that prior analysis. My beliefs about the case parameters (\u03b8) are therefore stable but have gained a sharper focus regarding the central points of uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Stable Belief on Appointments Clause Violation (Question 1):** My conviction remains high that the Court will find the Task Force's structure violates the Appointments Clause. This belief is anchored in the respondents' arguments, which directly leverage the Court's own precedent in *Edmond v. United States* and the specific statutory language (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) that mandates the Task Force's independence. This part of the predictive model is stable, and I continue to anticipate a \"Yes\" on the first question.\n\n2.  **Solidified Understanding of the Severability Conflict (Question 2):** My prior update noted a decrease in confidence in a simple severability outcome. This internal reasoning step solidifies that shift. The conflict is not a standard debate over legislative intent but a fundamental clash of judicial philosophies.\n    *   **Pro-Severability (Government's likely position):** This side is represented by the Court's recent, pragmatic precedent in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, which favors surgical remedies that preserve the broader statutory scheme while curing the constitutional defect. This approach prioritizes institutional stability and gives effect to Congress's presumed primary objectives.\n    *   **Anti-Severability (Respondents' position):** This side is represented by the \"writ-of-erasure fallacy\" argument, championed by Jonathan Mitchell. This is a textualist/originalist challenge to the Court's remedial power, arguing that courts cannot \"rewrite\" or \"erase\" statutory text but may only decline to enforce an unconstitutional law. This philosophy prioritizes a strict separation of powers, viewing the *Arthrex*-style remedy as judicial overreach into the legislative domain.\n\n3.  **Refined Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** The observation has clarified that the most critical unknown parameter (\u03b8) for predicting the case outcome is no longer *if* the *Arthrex* remedy will be challenged, but *how the government will defend it* against this specific, sophisticated \"writ-of-erasure\" attack. The Solicitor General's response in the forthcoming merits brief is now the single most important piece of evidence needed. My predictive model for the second question now hinges on forecasting the government's counter-arguments and which judicial philosophy will persuade a majority of the Court, particularly Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett, who were central to the *Arthrex* outcome, and Justice Gorsuch, who may be sympathetic to the \"writ-of-erasure\" theory. The probability of a \"Yes; No\" outcome (violation found, severance denied) remains significantly elevated compared to my initial beliefs.",

          "thought": "I have now reviewed the petitioner's (U.S. Government) merits brief. This has significantly clarified their arguments on both the Appointments Clause and severability questions. My key uncertainties have been refined. For the Appointments Clause question, the uncertainty is whether the Court will accept the government's argument that the HHS Secretary has sufficient control via at-will removal and the power to deny binding effect. For the severability question, the uncertainty is whether the Court will follow its recent pragmatic precedent (*Arthrex*) as urged by the government, or be persuaded by the respondents' more radical 'writ-of-erasure' theory. To resolve these uncertainties, the most critical next piece of information is the respondents' merits brief. This document will contain their direct counter-arguments to the government's claims and will fully develop their own legal theories. I need to see how they rebut the 'sufficient control' argument and how they justify their anti-severability stance in the face of the government's reliance on *Arthrex*. Therefore, my next action will be to search for the respondents' merits brief."

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the petitioners' (U.S. Government) merits brief is a critical input, providing the first complete view of the government's legal strategy. It directly addresses the key uncertainties I had previously identified, causing a significant evolution in my beliefs about the case parameters (\u03b8) and the likely outcome. My understanding has shifted from anticipating a defensive crouch to seeing a confident, two-pronged offensive.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs:**\n    *   The fundamental legal questions regarding the Appointments Clause and severability remain the core of the case.\n    *   The clash between the pragmatic remedial approach of *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* and the textualist/originalist \"writ-of-erasure\" theory remains the central conflict on the severability question.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs:**\n    *   **Reduced Confidence in Appointments Clause Violation (Question 1):** My prior high conviction that the Court would find a violation has been substantially moderated. The government's brief presents a robust, multi-faceted argument that Task Force members are, in fact, properly supervised inferior officers. This argument rests on two specific mechanisms of secretarial control that I had not previously weighted heavily:\n        *   **At-Will Removal Power:** The government asserts that because the statute is silent on removal, the default rule for executive officers applies, granting the HHS Secretary at-will removal power. They frame this as a quintessential \"powerful tool for control,\" citing the Court's own language in *Edmond v. United States*.\n        *   **Power to Deny Binding Effect:** The government argues the Secretary possesses the ultimate authority to decide whether a Task Force recommendation gains the force of law. They ground this power in two sources: 1) The statutory requirement (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b)(1)) that the Secretary establish a \"minimum interval\" of at least one year before a recommendation becomes a binding mandate, which they characterize as a period for secretarial review and potential nullification; and 2) The broad transfer of authority over the Public Health Service to the Secretary under the Reorganization Plan of 1966.\n        This two-part argument directly counters the Fifth Circuit's reasoning by reinterpreting the \"independence\" clause (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) as protecting only the members' scientific judgment from political pressure, not insulating their final recommendations from the Secretary's legal authority. This makes a ruling of \"No\" on the first question a far more plausible outcome than I previously believed.\n\n    *   **Clarified Government Strategy on Severability (Question 2):** The brief resolves my prior uncertainty about how the government would counter the respondents' sophisticated severability challenge. The government has made a clear strategic choice: they are not engaging the \"writ-of-erasure\" theory on its own philosophical terms. Instead, they are framing the issue as a straightforward application of modern severability precedent. They explicitly state that if a violation is found, the proper remedy is to sever the \"independence\" clause (\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)), which is precisely \"the cure that this Court chose in *Arthrex*.\" By citing *Arthrex*, *Free Enterprise Fund*, and *Barr v. American Ass'n of Political Consultants*, they are directly appealing to the Court's majority to follow its own recent, pragmatic playbook for curing constitutional defects while preserving congressional statutes.\n\n3.  **Refined Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** The petitioner's brief has resolved my previous primary uncertainty and replaced it with a more nuanced set of predictive challenges. The critical parameter (\u03b8) is no longer *how* the government will argue, but *which* of two distinct paths the Court's majority will choose.\n    *   **Path 1 (No Violation):** Will the Court be persuaded by the government's argument that the combination of at-will removal and the power to deny binding effect constitutes sufficient supervision under *Edmond*? This is now a live and critical question. A majority finding for the government here would end the case without reaching severability.\n    *   **Path 2 (Violation Found, Remedy Debated):** If a violation is found, will the majority (specifically the Chief Justice and Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett, who were central to the *Arthrex* and *Collins* outcomes) adhere to their established pragmatic approach and sever the offending clause? Or will they be swayed by the respondents' textualist/originalist challenge to the Court's remedial power, potentially with support from Justice Gorsuch?\n\nThe government's brief strengthens the probability of two outcomes: a complete victory for the government on Question 1, or a \"Yes; Yes\" result (violation found, but cured by severance). The probability of the \"Yes; No\" outcome (violation found, severance denied), while still significant due to the force of the respondents' likely arguments, is now comparatively lower than before, as the government has presented the Court with a clear, precedential off-ramp to avoid that disruptive result.",

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3.

Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5.

The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L.

II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force.

See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L.

II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet. App. \n115a\u2013116a; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) (\u201cAll mem-\nbers of the Task Force convened under this subsection, \nand any recommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not sub-\nject to political pressure.\u201d).  \nThe district court also held, in the alternative, that \nthe Task Force members would be unconstitutionally ap-\npointed even if they were deemed \u201cinferior\u201d officers be-\ncause they were appointed by the AHRQ director, who is \nnot a \u201cHead of Department\u201d under Article. II. Pet. App. \n116a (\u201c \u2018[T]he term \u201cDepartment\u201d refers only to a part or \ndivision of the executive government, as the Department \nof State, or of the Treasury, expressly created and given \n \n12.

The \nplaintiffs eventually stipulated to a stay of the nation-\nwide injunction and the universal vacatur of the disputed \n\u201cagency actions,\u201d leaving in place only relief that shields \nthe named plaintiffs from statutory penalties and en-\nforcement actions for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1).13 In exchange for this stipulation, the defend-\nants promised that they would not seek penalties against \nthe plaintiffs for actions taken in reliance on the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment if that judgment were to be vacated or \nnarrowed on appeal.14  \n \n13.

The court of appeals al-\nso agreed with the district court (and the plaintiffs) that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d officers who \nmust be appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s \nadvice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d officers who \ncan be appointed by a Head of Department. See id. The \ncourt of appeals cited this Court\u2019s definition of \u201cinferior \nofficer\u201d in Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 (1997), \nwhich equates \u201cinferior officers\u201d with \u201cofficers whose \nwork is directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u201d Id. at 663; see also \nPet. App. 16a. The Task Force members fall outside Ed-\nmond\u2019s definition of \u201cinferior officers,\u201d according to the \n \n17. See Secretary of HHS, Ratification of Prior Appointment and \nProspective Appointment: Appointment Affidavits (June 28, \n2023), http://bit.ly/3Yt94C0 [https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN]; Op-\nening Br. for the Federal Defendants, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 23-10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, \navailable at http://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] \n(\u201cAlthough the existing Task Force members have not yet re-\nceived an appointment consistent with the Appointments \nClause, the Secretary has authority to appoint Task Force \nmembers and is in the process of providing them with a consti-\ntutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n16 \ncourt of appeals, because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) im-\nmunizes their work and recommendations from direction \nand supervision by others:  \n[W]e cannot say that any such supervision ex-\nists\u2014as a matter of law or reality. . . . [W]e \nneed look no further than the statutory provi-\nsion we just addressed, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6), which again provides that \u201c[a]ll mem-\nbers of the Task Force . . . , and any recom-\nmendations made by such members, shall be \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d . . . . [I]t is a clear \nand express directive from Congress that the \nTask Force be free from any supervision. In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet. App. 20a. The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure. Pet. \nApp. 23a (\u201c[T]he statutory scheme . . . envisions no su-\npervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure.\u201d); see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \n\n \n \n \n17 \nU.S. 281, 296 (2018) (constitutional-avoidance canon may \nnot be invoked unless the proposed interpretation is both \n\u201cplausible\u201d and \u201cfairly possible\u201d).  \n2. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20136, Braidwood Management \nInc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id. (\u201c[T]he man-\ndates deprive Braidwood of the ability to choose whether \nand to what extent its insurance plan covers preventive \ncare.\u201d); Pet. App. 95a\u201397a (describing each of Braid-\nwood\u2019s Article III injuries). And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F. Hotze \u00b6\u00b6 7\u201319, Braidwood Manage-\nment Inc. v. Becerra, No. 4:20-cv-00283-O (N.D. Tex.), ECF No. \n46. \n22. The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

R. Civ. P. \n58(a). \nThis action came on for consideration by the Court, \nand the issues having been duly considered and a deci-\nsion duly rendered in the Court\u2019s orders partially grant-\ning and partially denying the parties\u2019 motions for sum-\nmary judgment. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED that: \n\n 2a \n1)  All claims of Joel Miller and Gregory Scheideman \nin the above-entitled and numbered cause are \nhereby DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n \n2) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration (HRSA) do not, on the rec-\nord in this case, violate Article II\u2019s Appointments \nclause. Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing. To resolve questions raised in litigation and out \nof an abundance of caution, for purposes of coverage un-\nder the statute, I ratify the below listed guidelines and \nrecommendations for the reasons relied on by the \nUSPSTF, ACIP and the Director of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC Director), and the \nHRSA Administrator in their previously published deci-\nsions or analyses regarding the relevant recommenda-\ntions. This action is not intended to suggest any legal de-\nfect or infirmity in the authority of these entities to issue \npreventive service guidelines and recommendations. \n\u2022 Evidence-based clinical preventive services that \nhave in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the rec-\nommendations of the USPSTF as of the date of \nthis ratification, with the exception of the 2016 \n\n 6a \nUSPSTF recommendation on screening for \nbreast cancer, set forth in Exhibit A, attached; \n\u2022 Immunizations that have in effect a recommenda-\ntion from ACIP and the CDC Director with re-\nspect to the individual involved as of the date of \nthis ratification, set forth in Exhibit B, attached; \n\u2022 With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings \nprovided for in the comprehensive guidelines sup-\nported by HRSA as of the date of this ratification, \nset forth in Exhibit C, attached; and \n\u2022 With respect to women, such additional preven-\ntive care and screenings as provided for in com-\nprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for \npurposes of 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 300gg13(a) as of the \ndate of this ratification, set forth in Exhibit D, at-\ntached. \nPursuant to my authority as Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and based on my independent and con-\nsidered review of the actions and decisions listed above, I \nhereby affirm and ratify the above recommendations and \nguidelines. \n \n January 21, 2022 \n \nXavier Becerra \nDate",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation consists of my own internal reasoning, summarizing the state of my beliefs after analyzing the petitioner's brief and identifying the next necessary piece of evidence. As this observation contains no new external information, facts, or arguments about the case, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable. My current understanding is as follows:\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs:**\n    *   The core legal questions remain the constitutionality of the Task Force's structure under the Appointments Clause and the severability of any offending statutory provisions.\n    *   The central conflict on the remedy question is between the Court's recent pragmatic approach to severability (*United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*) and a more absolutist, textualist/originalist theory that would invalidate the entire preventive care mandate.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (from Petitioner's Brief):**\n    *   **Plausibility of \"No Violation\" on Question 1:** The government's merits brief has significantly increased the perceived probability that the Court could rule there is no Appointments Clause violation. This rests on a robust two-part argument that the HHS Secretary retains sufficient control over Task Force members, making them inferior officers:\n        *   **Implied At-Will Removal Power:** The government argues that statutory silence on removal defaults to the executive's power to remove officers at will, a key tool of supervision per *Edmond v. United States*.\n        *   **Authority to Deny Legal Effect:** The government contends the Secretary can prevent a Task Force recommendation from becoming a binding mandate through two mechanisms: 1) the statutory power to set a \"minimum interval\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b)(1)) before a recommendation takes effect, which they frame as a period for review and nullification; and 2) the Secretary's broad authority over the Public Health Service via the 1966 Reorganization Plan.\n    *   **Clarified Government Strategy on Severability (Question 2):** The government has clearly signaled it will not engage in a philosophical debate on the \"writ-of-erasure\" theory. Instead, its strategy is to present the Court with a simple, precedential choice: follow the playbook from *Arthrex*, *Free Enterprise Fund*, and *Barr v. American Ass'n of Political Consultants* by severing the specific clause that creates the constitutional problem (the \"independence\" clause, \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) and preserving the rest of the statute.\n\n3.  **Refined Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** My predictive focus has shifted from *what* the government would argue to *which path* the Court's majority will choose now that the government's arguments are known. The primary uncertainties are:\n    *   **On the Merits (Question 1):** Will a majority of the Court be persuaded by the government's interpretation of the Secretary's supervisory powers (at-will removal and denial of legal effect) as sufficient under the Appointments Clause? A \"yes\" here resolves the case in the government's favor.\n    *   **On the Remedy (Question 2):** If a violation is found, will the majority coalition (likely centered around the Chief Justice and Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett) adhere to its own recent, pragmatic severability precedent as laid out in *Arthrex*? Or will they be persuaded by the respondents' anticipated arguments for a more disruptive, non-severable outcome?\n\nThe observation of my own thought process confirms that the next critical piece of evidence required to update these beliefs is the respondents' merits brief. That document will provide the direct counterarguments to the government's claims and will be essential for evaluating the relative strength of the two paths the Court might take.",

      "action_content": "Thought: My previous search for the respondents' merits brief returned their 'Brief in Support of Certiorari' instead. While this is not the full merits brief I was seeking, it is still a highly valuable document that provides a clear and authoritative preview of the respondents' core legal arguments. It confirms my hypothesis that they will advance a maximalist, theoretically ambitious challenge on both the Appointments Clause and severability questions. \n\nSpecifically, the brief confirms:\n1.  **Appointments Clause Argument (Question 1):** Respondents argue that Task Force members are 'principal officers,' not 'inferior officers.' Their reasoning is that the statutory requirement for independence (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) legally prohibits the 'direction and supervision' by the HHS Secretary that would be necessary to classify them as inferior under *Edmond v. United States*. They explicitly reject the government's position that at-will removal power is sufficient to establish inferior status.\n2.  **Severability Argument (Question 2):** Respondents explicitly argue that the court of appeals was correct to refuse to 'sever' the independence clause. This confirms they are adopting the 'writ-of-erasure' theory, as indicated by the citation to their counsel Jonathan Mitchell's law review article. They will argue that the court cannot rewrite the statute to make the Task Force constitutional; it can only declare the provision unenforceable.\n\nThis observation has significantly reduced my uncertainty about the *content* of the respondents' arguments. The central uncertainty (\u03b8) is now less about what the parties will argue and more about which of these two competing, well-defined legal frameworks the majority of the Court will adopt. \n\nMy next step should be to find the full merits briefs to see the complete articulation of these arguments. However, since my direct search for the respondent's merits brief failed, I will broaden my search. I will search for any merits-stage briefs filed in the case. This could capture the respondent's brief if it was filed under a slightly different name, and it will also capture any amicus briefs, which are now extremely valuable for gauging how these arguments are resonating with different ideological and interest groups.",

The information it processes\u2014the respondents' cert-stage brief\u2014was obtained in the previous step, but this action is where that raw data is transformed into a structured update of the agent's beliefs.\n\nTask EIG (0.8): The value is extremely high because the agent correctly identifies the maximalist nature of the respondents' arguments on both the Appointments Clause and severability. It moves the core uncertainty (\u03b8) from 'What will the respondents argue?' to 'Which of these two well-defined, competing legal philosophies will the Court adopt?'. This is a massive reduction in uncertainty and a significant sharpening of the predictive task. The synthesis of the 'principal officer' and 'writ-of-erasure' theories is the key insight that will structure all future analysis.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable strategy. It shows the importance of extracting value from an 'unsuccessful' search that returns a different but still valuable document. It models the crucial cognitive step of updating a problem definition (the nature of \u03b8) in light of new evidence and then using that updated model to plan a more intelligent next action (broadening the search for all merits briefs). This pattern of 'pivot, synthesize, and replan' is a valuable meta-strategy for SCOTUS prediction.\n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action provides substantial value on both dimensions. It fundamentally reframes the specific prediction task while also demonstrating a sophisticated, reusable analytical process.",

        "observation_result": "Internal reasoning: My previous search for the respondents' merits brief returned their 'Brief in Support of Certiorari' instead. While this is not the full merits brief I was seeking, it is still a highly valuable document that provides a clear and authoritative preview of the respondents' core legal arguments. It confirms my hypothesis that they will advance a maximalist, theoretically ambitious challenge on both the Appointments Clause and severability questions. \n\nSpecifically, the brief confirms:\n1.  **Appointments Clause Argument (Question 1):** Respondents argue that Task Force members are 'principal officers,' not 'inferior officers.' Their reasoning is that the statutory requirement for independence (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) legally prohibits the 'direction and supervision' by the HHS Secretary that would be necessary to classify them as inferior under *Edmond v. United States*. They explicitly reject the government's position that at-will removal power is sufficient to establish inferior status.\n2.  **Severability Argument (Question 2):** Respondents explicitly argue that the court of appeals was correct to refuse to 'sever' the independence clause. This confirms they are adopting the 'writ-of-erasure' theory, as indicated by the citation to their counsel Jonathan Mitchell's law review article. They will argue that the court cannot rewrite the statute to make the Task Force constitutional; it can only declare the provision unenforceable.\n\nThis observation has significantly reduced my uncertainty about the *content* of the respondents' arguments.

However, since my direct search for the respondent's merits brief failed, I will broaden my search. I will search for any merits-stage briefs filed in the case.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the respondents' \"Brief in Support of Certiorari,\" while not their full merits brief, provides a clear and authoritative preview of their legal strategy. This significantly sharpens my understanding of the arguments the Court will consider and allows me to move from anticipating the respondents' position to analyzing it directly. My beliefs have evolved as follows:\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs:**\n    *   The fundamental legal issues remain the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's structure under the Appointments Clause and the severability of the statutory scheme if a violation is found.\n    *   The government's strategy is stable: argue that Task Force members are inferior officers due to the Secretary's implied removal power and supervisory authority, and if that fails, argue for the narrow, precedented remedy of severing only the \"independence\" clause, as was done in *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (from Respondents' Cert-Stage Brief):**\n    *   **Confirmation of a Maximalist Appointments Clause Argument (Question 1):** The respondents are not merely refuting the government's \"inferior officer\" theory; they are affirmatively arguing that Task Force members are **principal officers**. Their argument, now previewed, rests on two pillars:\n        *   **Rejection of Removal as Sufficient for \"Inferior\" Status:** They will argue that at-will removal power alone does not make an officer \"inferior.\" They contend the dispositive factor under *Edmond v. United States* is being \"directed and supervised\" by a superior.\n        *   **Statutory Independence as a Bar to Supervision:** They will argue that the plain text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which mandates that the Task Force \"shall be independent and... not subject to political pressure,\" legally prohibits the very direction and supervision that would be necessary to classify the members as inferior officers. They see the government's claims of supervisory power as a direct contradiction of the statute.\n    *   **Confirmation of a Disruptive Remedial Theory (Question 2):** The respondents have confirmed they will directly challenge the Court's recent severability precedents. Their argument, as signaled by their counsel (Jonathan Mitchell) and his scholarship cited in the brief (\"The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy\"), is that courts lack the constitutional power to \"sever\" or \"nullify\" a single statutory clause to save a legislative scheme. They will argue that if the Task Force's independence is unconstitutional, the Court cannot simply rewrite the law to make them supervised. Instead, the entire statutory provision that relies on their recommendations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)) must be rendered unenforceable. This is a direct attack on the remedial playbook used in *Arthrex*, *Free Enterprise Fund*, and *Barr*.\n\n3.  **Refined Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** The battle lines are now drawn with exceptional clarity. My predictive task is no longer about guessing arguments but about forecasting which of two well-defined, competing legal philosophies will command a majority.\n    *   **On the Merits (Question 1):** The central uncertainty is how the Court will resolve the tension between the executive's background removal power and an explicit statutory command for independence. Will a majority find that the Secretary's implied powers are sufficient to constitute \"supervision\" under *Edmond* (the government's position)? Or will they find that the independence clause is controlling, making the members unsupervised and therefore *principal* officers (the respondents' position)? The latter is a much more constitutionally significant holding.\n    *   **On the Remedy (Question 2):** The uncertainty is a direct conflict of judicial ideology. Will the majority coalition (likely centered on the Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh) adhere to its own recent, pragmatic severability precedent from *Arthrex* to preserve the ACA's preventive care mandate? Or will a majority be persuaded by the respondents' textualist/originalist \"writ-of-erasure\" theory, which would forbid such a judicial fix and lead to a far more disruptive outcome? This sets up a potential clash between the Court's pragmatists and its textualist purists.\n\nThe next critical observation remains the full merits briefs from both parties, which will flesh out these previewed arguments with detailed historical and doctrinal support. However, this cert-stage brief has substantially reduced my uncertainty about the nature of the respondents' case, confirming it will be a theoretically ambitious and direct challenge to established precedent on both the appointments and remedies questions.",

For these \nconditions, early detection and preventive services, \nincluding those recommended by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force (\u201cUSPSTF\u201d or \u201cTask Force\u201d), are \ncritical.  Further, removal of financial barriers for such \npreventive services pursuant to the preventive care \nmandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct (\u201cACA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13, is one of the most \neffective tools amici have to ensure the health and well-\nbeing of their communities.  Amici write to explain the \nlegal errors of the lower court\u2019s decision and to provide \nunique insights, based on their direct experience \nworking \nwith \ndisproportionately \nvulnerable \ncommunities, how the outcome of this case will impact \naccess to critical preventive services such as diabetes \nscreening, cancer prevention measures, and numerous \nother preventive interventions recommended by the \nUSPSTF. \nThe Center for HIV Law and Policy (\u201cCHLP\u201d) is a \nnational, abolitionist legal and policy organization \nfighting to end stigma, discrimination, and violence \n \n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae state that no \ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \nperson or entity other than amici or their counsel has made a \nmonetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this \nbrief.  \n\n2 \n \nagainst people living with and vulnerable to human \nimmunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) and other stigmatized \nhealth conditions.  CHLP utilizes legal advocacy, high-\nimpact policy and research initiatives, and the creation \nof multi-issue partnerships, networks, and resources to \nsupport its communities.  CHLP operates within and \naround criminal, legal, and public health systems at the \nstate and federal levels to craft policies that amplify the \npower of mobilizations for systemic change guided by \nracial, gender, and economic justice.  CHLP collaborates \nwith people living with HIV, organizers and base \nbuilders, \ndirect \nservice \nproviders, \nand \nnational \norganizations to identify, create, and share expertly \ncrafted, intersectional legal and policy resources and \nadvocacy strategies.  \nThe Afiya Center is a reproductive justice \norganization centered on transforming the lives of Black \nwomen and girls in Texas.  This case directly impacts \nAfiya Center\u2019s mission to advocate for comprehensive \nhealthcare access for Black communities in Texas, \nparticularly those affected by HIV.  The Afiya Center \nserves as a crucial support system for Black Texans \nliving with HIV, many of whom rely on preventive care \nservices mandated by the ACA.  The potential \nelimination of the requirement that health plans cover \npre-exposure prophylaxis (\u201cPrEP\u201d) medications without \ncost-sharing would have devastating consequences for \nthe community the Afiya Center serves.  Texas already \nfaces significant disparities in HIV prevention and \ntreatment, with Black individuals accounting for a \ndisproportionate number of new HIV diagnoses in the \nstate. \n\n3 \n \nWomen With A Vision (\u201cWWAV\u201d) is a Louisiana-\nbased organization working to improve the lives of \nmarginalized women, their families, and communities by \naddressing the social conditions that hinder their health \nand well-being.  WWAV accomplishes this through \nrelentless advocacy, health education, supportive \nservices, and community-based participatory research.  \nWWAV was founded in direct response to the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic, to ensure that its communities \nreceived the resources necessary to prevent the \ntransmission of HIV.  Thirty-five years later, WWAV \ncontinues to lead this work through the implementation \nof Louisiana\u2019s Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative, \nalongside community-based organizations, healthcare \nand direct service providers, and health departments. \nEquality \nFederation is a national advocacy \norganization dedicated to advancing equality for lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people across the \nUnited States, that has a substantial interest in ensuring \nLGBTQ+ individuals can lead fulfilling lives free from \ndiscrimination, with unimpeded access to essential \nhealthcare services.  As an organization at the forefront \nof LGBTQ+ advocacy, Equality Federation seeks to \nprovide this Court with crucial insights into the real-\nworld implications of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.   \nPrEP In Black America (\u201cthe Coalition\u201d) is a \ncoalition of Black HIV prevention advocates from across \nthe country that mobilizes communities around various \npolicy issues that impact access to PrEP, for the \nprevention of HIV.  The Coalition convenes community \nmembers through in-person summits, virtual webinars, \nand workshops at leading HIV and sexual health \n\n4 \n \nconferences.  Through community engagement, the \nCoalition generates reports and statements to engage \nkey stakeholders such as legislators, as well as local, \nstate, and federal public health officials. \nSisterLove, Inc., founded in 1989, is the first \nwomen\u2019s HIV, Sexual and Reproductive Justice \norganization in the southeastern United States \ndedicated to eradicating the adverse impact of HIV, and \nsexual and reproductive health rights and justice \nchallenges impacting women and their families, gender \nexpansive and LGBTQ+ individuals, and others from \nmarginalized communities.  SisterLove operates at the \nintersection of human rights and social justice, focusing \non education, prevention, support, research, and legal \nand political advocacy both in the United States and \ninternationally. \nBlaqOut is a Black-led organization dedicated to \nadvancing the health and well-being of Black LGBTQ+ \ncommunities \nthrough \nculturally \nresponsive \ncare, \nadvocacy, and public health innovation.  Central to its \nwork is ensuring access to lifesaving HIV prevention \ntools, particularly PrEP.  The USPSTF awarded PrEP \nan \u201cA\u201d rating based on its proven efficacy in preventing \nHIV transmission.  BlaqOut\u2019s proprietary public health \ninterventions have achieved a 96% adherence rate \namong members\u2014a rate among the highest documented \nnationally.  Given the Center for Disease Control\u2019s \n(\u201cCDC\u201d) 2016 projection that one in two Black men who \nhave sex with men will contract HIV in their lifetime \nwithout substantial reductions in transmission rates, \ncontinued cost-free access to PrEP is essential.  \nRestricting access would reverse critical progress, \n\n5 \n \nendangering \nthe \nlives \nof \nthose \nalready \ndisproportionately impacted by HIV. \nSTATEMENT \nEstablished \nin \n1984, \nunder \nthe \nReagan \nAdministration, the United States Preventive Services \nTask Force (\u201cTask Force\u201d) was originally convened by \nEdward N.

Under the ACA, \nCongress requires health insurance issuers and health \nplans to cover certain preventive services recommended \nby the Task Force without imposing any cost-sharing \nrequirements on patients.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision would jeopardize the ACA\u2019s \nguarantee of cost-free coverage for the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommended services\u2014a measure that ensures more \nthan 150 million Americans\u2019 access to life-saving \nhealthcare.   \nAmici submit that Congress\u2019s choice to empower the \nTask Force should be upheld.  The Task Force sits \nwithin the Public Health Service, over which the HHS \nSecretary exercises supervisory authority.  Moreover, \nthe HHS Secretary may remove Task Force members at \nwill, and these members have a limited mandate: issue \n \n20 Examining the United States Preventive Task Force, supra note \n3, at 14; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). \n\n10 \n \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nconcerning \npreventive health services.   \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, the Task \nForce\u2019s structure does not violate the Appointments \nClause of the Constitution, art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  Task Force \nmembers are removable at will, are supervised by \nsuperiors, and have narrow jurisdiction, limited duties, \nand limited tenure.  Under this Court\u2019s precedents, Task \nForce members are inferior officers who are subordinate \nto the HHS Secretary.  Upending the scheme that \nCongress \ncrafted \nwould \nhave \nsevere \npractical \nconsequences for millions of Americans who benefit from \nno-cost preventive services based on the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations.   \nFurther, amici write to emphasize the importance of \nTask Force recommendations and no-cost preventive \ncare on public health in America.

Fairfax Dr., Suite 300 \nArlington, VA  22203 \n(202) 869-5210 \nPeggy.Little@NCLA.legal \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae \n \nMay 2, 2025 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS1 \n \nNCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit public-interest law firm. Professor Philip \nHamburger founded NCLA to challenge multiple constitutional defects in the \nmodern administrative state through original litigation, amicus curiae briefs, and \nother forms of advocacy. The \u201ccivil liberties\u201d of the organization\u2019s name include \nrights at least as old as the U.S. Constitution itself, such as jury trial, due process \nof law, and the right to be tried in front of impartial judges who provide their \nindependent judgments on the meaning of the law. Yet these selfsame civil rights \nare also very contemporary\u2014and in dire need of renewed vindication\u2014precisely \nbecause executive agencies and even the courts have neglected them for so long. \nNCLA aims to defend civil liberties\u2014primarily by asserting constitutional \nconstraints on the modern administrative state. Although Americans still enjoy \na shell of their Republic, a very different sort of government has developed within \nit\u2014a type, in fact, the Constitution was designed to prevent. This unconstitutional \nstate within the Constitution\u2019s United States is the focus of NCLA\u2019s concern. \nNCLA is particularly disturbed by the transformation of what was initially a \npurely advisory task force, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, into a \npowerful and wholly unaccountable \u201cagency\u201d unilaterally imposing mandatory \nmedical coverage obligations in the billions of dollars upon Americans and American \ninsurers. NCLA represents clients potentially affected by the new Question Presented \nand would have filed an amicus curiae brief at an earlier stage of these proceedings \nhad it been on notice that this question would be before the Court.  \nWhether these decisionmakers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d or \u201cinferior officers,\u201d \nCongress has not \u201cby Law\u201d vested the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services with authority to appoint them. Americans were thus wholly \nunrepresented in authorizing the appointments of the members of this task force who \nare accountable for the momentous and costly decisions by which they now bind \nmillions of Americans\u2014in violation of their core liberty of self-government. \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \n \n \nWhether Congress has \u201cby Law\u201d vested the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services with the authority to appoint members of the United \nStates Preventive Services Task Force. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The briefs should \naddress this Court\u2019s decisions in United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385 (1868), and \nUnited States v. Smith, 124 U.S. 525 (1888). \n \n \n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored any part of this letter brief and no person or entity, other than NCLA \nand its counsel, paid for its preparation or submission.  Rule 37.6. All parties received advance notice \nof NCLA\u2019s intent to file this amicus letter brief. Rule 37.2(a). \n \n\n2 \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nTHE MAJOR UNBRIEFED IMPLICATIONS OF HARTWELL AND \nSMITH SHOULD BE FIRST ADDRESSED ON REMAND \n \nNeither Hartwell nor Smith was properly briefed or argued to this Court. In \nthis court, neither party even cited the cases in their opening briefs. Indeed, the \ngovernment raised Hartwell only on reply with respect to Petitioner\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d \nargument that even if \u201cthis Court concludes that Task Force members are \u2018inferior \nofficers,\u2019 Congress has not \u2018vested\u2019 the Secretary with power to appoint those \nmembers,\u201d an argument which the government concedes is distinct from the question \nof whether Task Force members are inferior officers. Pet. Rep. Br.16. The government \ncorrectly notes that the Fifth Circuit did not address that distinct issue, and this \nCourt did not grant certiorari on it. Pet. Rep. Br. 17. \n \nAlthough, according to the government, Hartwell supports its contention that \nCongress vested the Secretary with power to appoint Task Force members, that is a \nmisreading of the precedent. The government\u2019s tortuous argument goes like this: 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299(a)\u2019s provision \u201cthat \u2018[t]he Secretary shall carry out\u2019 the statutory \nprovisions governing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) by \n\u2018acting through the [AHRQ] Director,\u2019 who is himself appointed and removable at will \nby the Secretary,\u201d combined with the statutory provision \u201cthat \u2018[t]he Director shall \nconvene\u2019 the Task Force, which shall be \u2018composed of individuals of appropriate \nexpertise,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299(b)-4(a)(1),\u201d empowers \u201cthe Secretary to personally appoint \nTask Force members while acting through the AHRQ Director\u2014and at minimum, to \napprove (or reject) the Director\u2019s selections.\u201d Pet. Rep. Br. at 17. As made clear at oral \nargument, \u201cconvene\u201d is not a synonym for \u201cappoint.\u201d2 \n \nNeither statute provides for appointments of the Task Force members \u201cby \nLaw\u201d\u2014whether separately or combined. This loose daisy chain of appointments \npowers for other HHS subagencies cannot just casually loop in unnamed positions \nthat lack statutory appointment instructions. This is especially consequential when \npersons in what initially were \u201cadvisory\u201d roles have now assumed the constitutional \n\u201csignificant authority\u201d of \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, \n126 (1976) and unilaterally decide what preventive services must be covered by \ninsurers without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on patients. \n \nHartwell \n \nHartwell cannot carry the weight the government places on it, nor can Smith.  \nBoth cases involved embezzlement statutes that imposed penalties on specified \n \n2 See Justice Thomas at Tr. pp. 5-8, 34; Justice Gorsuch pp. 63-64.  \n\n3 \n \npersons entrusted with public monies\u2014so the Court in both cases had to strictly \nconstrue the statutes under the canon of lenity.  Mr. Hartwell, a clerk in the office of \nan assistant treasurer was convicted under an 1846 penalty statute that expressly \ndefined those persons \u201cintended to be brought within its scope\u201d to include 1) \u201cAll \nofficers and other persons charged by this act \u2026 with the safe-keeping of the public \nmoney\u201d 2) \u201cany officer or agent of the United States, and all persons participating in \nsuch act\u201d and 3) \u201call persons charged with the safe-keeping, transfer or disbursement \nof the public money.\u201d The Hartwell majority accordingly posed the question presented \nas: \u201cWas the defendant an \u201cofficer or person \u2018charged with the safekeeping of the \npublic money\u2019 within the meaning of the act?\u201d (emphasis in original). And it answered \nthe question by saying, \u201cWe think he was both.\u201d 73 U.S. 393. Accordingly, the case \nrested on two holdings, and whether Hartwell was an officer or not was not necessary \nto the Court\u2019s decision that the embezzlement statute applied to him. \n \nWhile it is true that the majority also proceeded to find that that this clerk was \nan \u201cofficer\u201d because he was appointed by the assistant treasurer \u201cwith the \napprobation of the Secretary of the Treasury,\u201d it relied upon a specific provision in \nthe General Appropriation Act of July 23, 1866 to find that he was an officer. That \nprovision was cited as 14 Stat. at Large, 200 but actually appears at 14 Stat. at Large \n202. (Appended at Ex. A). It provided an appropriation \u201c[f]or salaries of the clerks \u2026 \nin the office of assistant treasurer at Boston\u201d and, among other things, \u201cauthorized\u201d \nthe assistant treasurer \u201cto appoint, with the approbation of the Secretary of the \nTreasury \u2026 one chief clerk\u201d and 15 additional clerks, at 8 different salary levels \nranging from $3000/year to $800/year, one porter at $700/year and a watchman at \n$600/year. In a single sentence, Hartwell held this \u201capprobation\u201d by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury sufficient to satisfy the Appointments Clause, thus elevating these 18 \nemployees to the status of \u201cofficers of the United States.\u201d \n \nThree justices dissented, finding that Mr. Hartwell could not, by order of the \nassistant treasurer by whom he was appointed, \u201cbe placed \u2026 [under a duty] imposed \non him by some act of Congress.\u201d The dissent specifically objected to the holding that \nhe was an \u201cofficer,\u201d pointing out that under the 1846 statute he was appointed by the \nassistant treasurer alone, and that \u201cby an act passed long since [in 1866], and which \ncan have no effect on the construction of this one, the assent of the Secretary of the \nTreasury is required.\u201d The dissent viewed the penalties to apply \u201cexclusively to the \nlegal custodians of the public money and not to their clerks.\u201d \n \nFrom this, the government argues that \u201c[u]nder Hartwell, Congress properly \nvests the appointment power in a head of a department where, as here, it gives that \ndepartment head ultimate authority over the appointment\u2014even if a subordinate \nofficer also plays a role in the appointment process.\u201d Pet. Rep. Br. 17.\u201d The \ngovernment even cites Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477 at 512 n.13 (2010) \n(FEF) to say that this Court \u201cha[s] previously found that the department head\u2019s mere \n\n4 \n \napproval of a subordinate\u2019s appointment satisfies the Appointments Clause.\u201d Id. \n \nNot quite. The FEF Court in fact recites this proposition, but notes that these \nare \u201cprecedents that petitioners do not ask us to revisit.\u201d Id. This Court\u2019s order of \nApril 25 is precisely an invitation to revisit these holdings. \n \nSmith \n \nSmith is even less illuminating about the questions presented in this case. \nSmith, also an embezzlement case (Oh, those faithless 19th century clerks!), held that \na clerk in the office of the collector of the customs could not be charged under the \nstatutes of the United States that imposed penalties upon \u201cofficers\u201d: \n \nA clerk of the collector is not an \u201cofficer of the United States\u201d \u2026 . An \nofficer of the United States can only be appointed by the president, by \nand with the advice and consent of the senate, or by a court of law, or \nthe head of a department. A person in the service of the government who \ndoes not derive his position from one of these sources is not an officer of \nthe United States. 124 U.S. 525, 531-2. \n \nSmith distinguishes Hartwell by stating that Mr. Hartwell\u2019s appointment by the \nassistant treasurer \u201ccould only be made with the approbation of the secretary of the \ntreasury,\u201d 124 U.S. at 532, referring to that \u201capprobation\u201d as a \u201cfact\u201d which \u201cin the \nopinion of the [Hartwell] court rendered his appointment one by the head of the \ndepartment within the constitutional provision.\u201d The unanimous Smith decision also \ndistinguished Hartwell by noting that the Secretary [of the Treasury] \u201cis not invested \nwith the selection of the clerks of the collector [of customs]; nor is their selection in \nany way dependent upon his approbation.\u201d 124 U.S. at 533. \n \nAcknowledging that the indictment had averred that Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment \nhad such \u201capprobation,\u201d the court held that \u201cas no law required this approbation, the \naverment cannot exert any influence on the mind of the court.\u201d Id. Indeed, it held \nthat because the Constitution \u201cdeclares that \u2018the congress may by law vest the \nappointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in \nthe courts of law, or in the heads of departments[,]\u2019 [t]here must be, therefore, a law \nauthorizing the head of department to appoint clerks of the collector before his \napprobation of their appointment can be required.  No such law is in existence.\u201d  124 \nU.S. at 533. \n \nThe government has argued, despite Smith, that the same daisy chain of \n\u201cappointment by approbation\u201d applies to inspectors of the customs office. See Pet. \nRep. Br. 17-18 n. 1 (\u201cThat method of appointing inferior officers traces back to the \nFounding era. See Act of Mar. 2, 1799, ch. 22, \u00a7 21, 1 Stat. 642 (1799) (authorizing \n\n5 \n \ncustoms officers to appoint customs inspectors \u201cwith the approbation of the principal \nofficer of the treasury department)\u201d); 4 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 164 (1843) (concluding that \ncustoms inspectors were \u201cinferior officers\u201d whose appointment was vested in the \nTreasury Secretary\u201d)). But opinions of the Attorney General are not law.3 Moreover, \nSmith holds that a proper appointment requires a predicate law for the head of \ndepartment to appoint the official as well as a law providing for approbation of the \nsubordinate\u2019s appointment, both of which are missing here. \n \nBecause the majority\u2019s holding that Mr. Hartwell was an \u201cofficer\u201d was not \nnecessary to its decision\u2014he was liable whether an officer or a person\u2014Hartwell is \nan exceedingly slender reed upon which to erect the Task Force\u2019s legitimacy. The \ncontext of the cases matters, too. Neither Smith nor Hartwell involved questions of \nthe legitimacy of either clerk\u2019s appointment to exercise executive powers and \nauthority to influence the lives of Americans, but instead the more technical question \nof their personal exposure to criminal statutes. For this Court to render a decision \nthat relies on these out-of-context cases that antedate modern Appointments Clause \njurisprudence, and to do so as a matter of \u201cfirst view\u201d not final review, without a lower \ncourt record and consideration based upon robust briefing, would depart from settled \npractice and precedent of this court. The Supreme Court is \u201ca court of final review \nand not first view,\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.S. 103, 110 (2001), \nand ordinarily \u201cdo[es] not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\u201d NCAA \nv. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999). To do so on this cursory record risks setting \nbinding precedent with unknown implications across the wide terrain of far-flung \nadministrative agencies and law. \n \nMoreover, this Court should revisit Hartwell in an appropriate, fully briefed \ncase because its alternate holding that mere \u201capprobation\u201d by a head of department \nsatisfies the Appointments Clause is both substantively and intuitively incorrect. On \nits facts, Hartwell\u2019s reading of an appropriations statute swept eight levels of Boston \nclerks, a porter and a watchman into the class of \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d a \nstatus that might well have come as a surprise to the watchman and porter and some \nor all of the eight tiers of assistant and subordinate clerks. These counter-intuitive \npromotions, moreover, were not necessary to the holding and thus Hartwell\u2019s putative \nsignificance is both misleading and erroneous. \n \nThe government\u2019s deployment of this ancient, ill-considered, outlier case to \nlegitimize the far more shocking and consequential elevation of members of a \n \n3 See McElroy v. U.S. ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U.S. 281, 285-86 (1960) (an 1872 opinion of the Attorney \nGeneral is \u201centitled to some weight\u201d but such opinions \u201cdo not have the force of judicial decisions.\u201d);   \nLewis Pub. Co. v. Morgan, 229 U.S. 288, 311 (1913) (opinion of the Attorney General was not \u201cadequate \nto control or modify the conclusion we have reached as to the meaning of the provision.\u201d); Schick v. \nReed, 419 U.S. 256, 275 n.12 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u201cA legal opinion from the Attorney \nGeneral \u2026 hardly bears the force of law.\u201d). \n\n6 \n \nvolunteer advisory council into \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d through verbal \nlegerdemain where \u201capprobation\u201d equals \u201cappointment\u201d and \u201cconvene\u201d is good enough \nto mean both, eviscerates the whole purpose of the Appointments Clause by diluting \nthe accountability of heads of departments. These early cases predate the Court\u2019s \nmodern Appointments Clause formalism and are not invoked in such cases as Lucia \nv. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018) and Seila Law, LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020).  The \nAppointments Clause exists to ensure that the people are governed by officials who \nare answerable to the public. NFIB v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 126 (2022) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cThe question before us is not how to respond to the \npandemic, but who holds the power to do so. \u2026 [W]e do not impugn the intentions \nbehind the agency\u2019s mandate. Instead, we only discharge our duty to enforce the law\u2019s \ndemands when it comes to the question who may govern the lives of 84 million \nAmericans.\u201d). \n \nII. \nNO STATUTE VESTS AUTHORITY IN ANYONE TO APPOINT \nMEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE AS OFFICERS OF THE UNITED \nSTATES, EITHER \u201cPRINCIPAL\u201d OR \u201cINFERIOR\u201d \n \nSo, what do Hartwell and Smith teach us? That in the first instance, a statute \nproperly passed by Congress through bicameralism and presentment must first vest \nthe authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States in someone, whether a \nhead of department, a court of law, or the President. Inferior officers cannot just \nspring up as the transformed members of an advisory task force that later morph into \npersons holding constitutional status and authority\u2014without the Constitution\u2019s \nrequired appointments process being followed to ensure accountability. \n \nThis is not only NCLA\u2019s view of the principal teaching to be drawn from these \ncases, but also the conclusion of two scholars who recently published a thoughtful \nanalysis of this new aspect of the case sub judice. In their trenchant and timely \nassessment, Professors Josh Blackman and Seth Barrett Tillman challenge whether \nthe 1966 Reorganization Plan, cited by the government as ostensible statutory \nauthority for vesting powers in the Secretary of HHS to appoint Task Force members, \nis even a \u201claw\u201d at all.4 See U.S. v. Maurice. 26 F. Cas. 1211, 1214-15 (C.C. D. Va. 1823) \n(No. 15,747) (Marshall, C.J.). \n \nThe professors also reviewed the statutes the government cites and came away \nempty-handed on authority for members of the Task Force to operate as lawful \n\u201cofficers of the United States.\u201d Noting that \u201cthis litigation has focused closely on \nwhether the task force members are \u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers, Blackman and \n \n4 See Josh Blackman and Seth Barrett Tillman, The Supreme Court\u2019s Order for Supplemental Briefing \nin Kennedy v. Braidwood and the Reorganization Plan of 1966, THE VOLOKH CONSPIRACY, April 28, \n2025, available at http://bit.ly/3YruL52. \n\n7 \n \nTillman conclude that the request for supplemental briefing: \n \n\u201cshift[s] focus to whether any of the appointments of Task Force \nmembers \u2026 by the Secretary were supported by some statute. \nIndeed, the Court\u2019s focus on Hartwell and Smith may suggest the \nCourt believes only express statutory authority is permissible to \nvalidate an exercise of the appointment power by an inferior \nofficer. \n \n\u201cIf the positions of Task Force members are not filled consistent \nwith the Appointments Clause and Inferior Office Appointments \nClause, that is, if members are not appointed under the authority \nof a statute, then the purported officeholders are not officers of \nthe United States of any stripe, principal or inferior. At most, they \nwould be \u2018employees.\u2019 And, as a general matter, we do not think \nemployees can exercise the \u2018significant authority\u2019 of an officer of \nthe United States. \u2026 Such employees certainly cannot be vested \nwith any sort of \u2018independence\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis principal officers and the \nPresident. Here, and elsewhere, so much turns on whether a \nperson is or is not an officer of the United States.\u201d \n \nAccordingly, if the Court decides this issue on the merits without \nremand, it should hold that no statute vests authority in anyone to appoint \nmembers of the Task Force, much less in a head of department, the judiciary, \nor the President. Hence, the Task Force members lack constitutionally \nrequired appointments necessary to authorize their exercise of unilateral \n\u201csignificant authority\u201d to mandate preventive health care that must be covered \nby insurers without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on patients. \nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPhilip Hamburger \nMark Chenoweth  \nMargaret A.

After the passage of the \nAffordable \nCare \nAct \n(\u201cACA\u201d), \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations became a critical first step in \nensuring effective interventions are covered by health \ninsurance. A wholesale invalidation of the coverage \nrequirement for Task Force\u2019s recommendations would \nstrike a critical, unnecessary and costly blow to the \nbattle to end HIV, hepatitis and other infectious \ndiseases. \nThis brief details the impact of HIV and \nhepatitis in the U.S., emphasizing that these are \ninfectious diseases spread by viruses which can and \nwill spread to any person unless prevented from doing \nso. Removing access to evidence-based preventive \nmeasures will have a devastating impact, not only on \nthose at risk for acquiring HIV and hepatitis, but also \nthe population at-large. \nWe then contend that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision relied on a fundamental misreading of the \nTask Force\u2019s enabling statute and a lack of \nunderstanding of how the executive branch has \nalready carried out its oversight function over the \nrecommendations of the Task Force. If properly \nunderstood, the Fifth Circuit could not have found \nthat the members of the Task Force were principal \nofficers in violation of the Appointments Clause. They \nare, in fact, inferior officers whose independence is \n\n4 \nsolely limited to the evidence-based process by which \nthey make their recommendations. For these reasons, \nwe urge this Court to reverse the lower court\u2019s \ndecisions \ninvalidating \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nHIV and Hepatitis Affect Millions of \nAmericans of All Demographics, and \nWeakening Bipartisan Efforts to End \nTheir Transmission Will Have \nCatastrophic Consequences. \nThe fight against HIV/AIDS is one of the most \nsignificant public health battles of the modern era. \nFor decades, false assumptions about how the virus \nspread and who was at risk impeded efforts to prevent \ntransmission and provide treatment. The devastating \ntoll of this delay is evident in the 700,000 American \nlives lost and the 1.2 million people still living with \nHIV. The HIV/AIDS Epidemic in the United States: \nThe Basics, KAISER FAM. FOUND. (Aug. 16, 2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/556bahnt. \nBoth Republican and Democratic presidential \nadministrations and Congresses have prioritized HIV \nprevention, treatment and research through decades \nof bipartisan efforts. These collective efforts have \nproduced scientific advancements in screening, \ntreatment and prevention of this disease and \nsimultaneously expanded access to the same.  \nThese \nadvancements \nhave fundamentally \nchanged the trajectory of HIV, with the evolution of \n\n5 \nroutine screening to enable early detection to the \nadvent of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) which \npromises nearly 100% effectiveness in the prevention \nof HIV and is the central object of Respondents\u2019 \ncomplaint. Today, we are closer than ever to ending \nHIV\u2019s painful 44-year ordeal. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(\u201cACA\u201d) requires that insurers cover Task Force-\nrecommended preventive services without cost-\nsharing. The Task Force, which has existed since \n1984, \nmade \nevidence-based \npreventive \ncare \nrecommendations before the enactment of the ACA. \nCongress \nincorporated \nthe \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations into the ACA to ensure essential \npreventive services were covered. This requirement \nassures access to HIV screening and PrEP for millions \nof Americans at risk of acquiring HIV. Stripping away \nthis \naccess \nwill \nundermine \nthe \ndecades-long, \nbipartisan fight against the epidemic. \nToday, while HIV is at its lowest ebb in the \nUnited \nStates, \nthere \nstill \nare \n32,000 \nnew \ntransmissions and 13,000 deaths annually. Id. This is \nunacceptable in our modern era. Without continued \naccess to the no-cost prevention assured under the \nACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation \nwill witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV \nresurges. \nViral hepatitis stands alongside HIV/AIDS as \none of our nation\u2019s most critical and under-addressed \npublic health challenges. Historical misconceptions \nabout transmission routes and affected populations \nhave significantly impeded prevention and treatment \n\n6 \nefforts, resulting in approximately 3.3 million \nAmericans living with chronic hepatitis B or C. HHS, \nVIRAL HEPATITIS: NATIONAL STRATEGIC PLAN 1 (2020), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3mrtejzw. While implementation \nof the bipartisan Viral Hepatitis National Strategic \nPlan has driven meaningful progress, hepatitis B \n(\u201cHBV\u201d) and hepatitis C (\u201cHCV\u201d) still claim roughly \n14,500 American lives each year.

This Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that Congress may incorporate \nthe evidence-based findings of disinterested expert \nbodies like the Task Force into law without \nimplicating the Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. Amici have a strong interest in defend-\ning Congress\u2019s decision to follow such a course here, \ngiven the vital role that the cost-free coverage that \nCongress mandated for recommended preventive \nservices plays in protecting the health of millions of \n \n1 This brief was not written in any part by counsel for a party. \nNo one other than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \nAmericans who may otherwise be deterred from \naccessing life-saving care. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe parties to this case debate the wrong question: \nwhether members of the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force (Task Force) are inferior or principal \nofficers of the United States within the meaning of the \nAppointments Clause. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, \nthe proper answer to the first question presented in \nthis case\u2014whether the structure of the Task Force \nviolates the Appointments Clause\u2014is no, because the \nmedical experts who periodically take part in the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations about clinical preventive-\nhealth services are not officers of the United States at \nall, and the Appointments Clause says nothing about \nhow they may or must be appointed.  \nSince its inception in 1984, the Task Force has had \none central task: to make expert recommendations to \nthe medical community about which preventive-care \nmeasures have been reliably shown to promote patient \nhealth. These evidence-based recommendations cover \ndozens of potentially life-saving clinical services. In \n2010, Congress endorsed the recommendations\u2019 \nreliability by incorporating them into the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. L. No. \n111-148, 124 Stat. 119, and requiring covered insurers \nto provide cost-free coverage for the recommended \nservices. Even after the ACA\u2019s passage, the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations are directed to the medical \ncommunity and are based solely on scientific evidence, \nnot on policy considerations about insurance coverage. \nCongress\u2019s decision to tie the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s clinical \nrecommendations did not convert the Task Force\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nmembers into federal officers subject to the Appoint-\nments Clause. To begin with, a member of the Task \nForce\u2014which is convened periodically on a volunteer \nbasis for a limited factfinding purpose\u2014does not hold \na federal \u201coffice\u201d in the first place. And either way, the \nTask Force does not have significant authority to \nexecute or apply federal law. As this Court\u2019s decisions \nhave long recognized, disinterested experts whom \nCongress has empowered to make discrete, empirical \njudgments on matters within their professional \nexpertise do not perform the enforcement or \npolicymaking duties that implicate the Appointments \nClause\u2014even where those judgments trigger legal \nconsequences. In holding that the Task Force\u2019s \nmembers are improperly appointed federal officers, \nthe decision below departed from this longstanding \nprinciple and cast constitutional doubt on numerous \nother legal provisions that incorporate the work of \nexpert professional bodies into federal law.  \nAffirming the erroneous decision below would \nvitiate Congress\u2019s sound judgment about how best to \nprotect public health. In enacting the ACA\u2019s \npreventive-care provisions, Congress recognized that \nearly diagnosis and treatment of serious medical \nconditions can dramatically improve health outcomes \nand can save money and lives. In the years since the \nACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans have come to \nrely on cost-free access to a wide range of preventive \nservices, including medications that reduce the risk of \nheart attack and stroke, screenings that can reduce \nthe risk of dying from lung cancer, and counseling that \ncan promote healthy pregnancies. Research shows \nthat the imposition of cost-sharing requirements for \nthese and other preventive services would sharply \nreduce the rate at which patients access them, thus \n\n \n4 \nreviving the public-health risks that Congress \npermissibly (and wisely) sought to address in the \nACA. Because the Constitution does not require such \na disruptive result, this Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Task Force is an expert body of health-\ncare professionals that has offered objective, \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nto \nthe \nmedical community for over forty years. \n \nA. The Task Force originated in 1984 as a \ntemporary 20-member expert body convened within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nby \nthe \nPublic \nHealth \nService \nto \n\u201cdevelop[] \nrecommendations for clinicians on the appropriate use \nof preventive interventions, based on a systematic \nreview of evidence of clinical effectiveness.\u201d Task \nForce, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services: Report of \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Overview (2d \ned. 1996), https://tinyurl.com/admzts59. In 1989, the \nfirst Task Force published its \u201ccomprehensive \nrecommendations\u201d regarding \u201cpreventive services for \n60 topic areas affecting patients from infancy to old \nage.\u201d Id. The following year, the Task Force was \nreconstituted as a 10-member body composed of family \nphysicians, internists, pediatricians, obstetrician-\ngynecologists, and methodologists, and was directed to \nupdate the recommendations based on the most recent \nscientific evidence. Id. The Task Force\u2019s second \niteration finished its work in 1996, and a third \niteration \nwas \nconvened \nin \n1998 \nto \nmake \nrecommendations on a rolling basis. See Task Force, \nProcedure Manual at 1 (May 2021) (Task Force, \nProcedure Manual), https://tinyurl.com/24nfkf9p.  \n\n \n5 \nIn 1999, the Task Force received congressional \nimprimatur with the passage of the Healthcare \nResearch and Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-129, 113 \nStat. 1653 (1999 Act). See Task Force, Procedure \nManual, app. I, at 56. The 1999 Act established the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \nwithin the Public Health Service, see 1999 Act, \u00a7 2(a), \n113 Stat. at 1653, and it empowered the AHRQ \nDirector to \u201cperiodically convene a Preventive \nServices Task Force \u2026 composed of individuals with \nappropriate expertise\u201d to \u201creview the scientific \nevidence related to the effectiveness, appropriateness, \nand cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive services \nfor the purpose of developing recommendations for the \nhealth care community, and updating previous \nclinical preventive recommendations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2(a), 113 \nStat. at 1659, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The AHRQ has continuously main-\ntained the Task Force as a standing body since 2001. \nSee Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2. Today, the \nTask Force consists of 16 volunteer members who \nserve on a rotating basis for staggered terms. Id. at i, \n2. Members are \u201cnationally recognized experts in \nprevention, evidence-based medicine, and primary \ncare who are also skilled in the critical evaluation of \nresearch and the implementation of evidence-based \nrecommendations in clinical practice.\u201d Id. at 2.  \nThe Task Force\u2019s clinical recommendations derive \nfrom a rigorous 4-step process that incorporates input \nfrom federal health agencies, partner organizations \nrepresenting primary care clinicians and other \nstakeholders, and the general public. See id. at 7\u201312. \nFirst, the Task Force selects a preventive-care topic to \nprioritize based on factors such as \u201cthe topic\u2019s \nimportance for public health\u201d and \u201cthe potential \n\n \n6 \nimpact of [a] recommendation.\u201d Task Force, USPSTF: \nWho We Are & How We Work, at 3 (2022) (Task Force, \nWho We Are), https://tinyurl.com/22e9ewek. Second, \nthe Task Force partners with \u201can academic or \nresearch organization with expertise in conducting \nsystematic evidence reviews\u201d to draft a research plan, \nwhich the Task Force finalizes after a 4-week public \ncomment period. Id. Third, the partner organization\u2019s \nresearchers \u201cgather, review, and analyze evidence on \nthe \n[selected] \ntopic \nfrom \nhigh-quality \nstudies \npublished in peer-reviewed scientific journals,\u201d after \nwhich the Task Force assesses the findings, creates a \ndraft recommendation, and opens the draft to public \ncomment. Id. Last, the Task Force finalizes the \nrecommendation based on the evidence review and \npublic comments and assigns the recommendation a \nletter grade to indicate its strength. Id. \nTask Force recommendations now \u201ccover more \nthan 80 preventive service topics for people across the \nlifespan\u2014from vision screening in young children, to \nheart disease prevention in adults, to colorectal cancer \nscreening in older adults.\u201d Id. at 1. While \u201cpolicy-\nmakers, managed care organizations, public and \nprivate payers, quality improvement organizations, \nresearch institutions, and patients\u201d all draw insights \nfrom the Task Force\u2019s work, \u201cthe main audience for \nTask Force recommendations is the primary care \nclinician.\u201d Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2; see also \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (defining the recommend-\nations\u2019 main audience as \u201cindividuals and organi-\nzations delivering clinical services\u201d). \nB. In the 2010 ACA, Congress incorporated some \nof the Task Force\u2019s expert recommendations into \nfederal law. Recognizing that preventive care plays a \ncritical role in promoting public health, see infra at pp. \n\n \n7 \n15\u201317, Congress required that insurers cover certain \npreventive services without passing on any portion of \nthe cost to the patient. Among the services included \nwithin this coverage requirement are all \u201cevidence-\nbased items or services\u201d that hold an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade \nfrom the Task Force. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). An \n\u201cA\u201d grade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net \nbenefit\u201d of a given service \u201cis substantial,\u201d while a \u201cB\u201d \ngrade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net benefit \nis moderate or \u2026 moderate certainty that the net \nbenefit is moderate to substantial.\u201d Task Force, Grade \nDefinitions (June 2018), https://tinyurl.com/3mcx\n9hsu. \nAlthough the Task Force\u2019s clinical recommend-\nations can trigger the ACA\u2019s coverage requirement, \nCongress directed that the recommendations remain \n\u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nAccordingly, and consistent with its longstanding \nmission of \u201cprovid[ing] primary care clinicians and \ntheir patients with information about the benefits and \nharms of a wide range of preventive services so that \ntogether they can make informed health care \ndecisions that are best for each patient,\u201d Task Force, \nWho We Are at 1, the Task Force continues to base its \nrecommendations on scientific and medical evidence, \nnot on insurance coverage considerations, id. at 6. As \nthe Task Force has explained, \u201c[c]overage decisions \nare determined by payors and policymakers.\u201d Id.; see \nTask Force, USPSTF: An Overview (2021), https:// \ntinyurl.com/mryspuua (\u201cAlthough the [ACA] created a \nlink between [Task Force] recommendations and \ninsurance coverage requirements, the Task Force \nmakes its recommendations based solely on the \nscientific evidence.\u201d). \n\n \n8 \nII.  The ACA\u2019s incorporation of Task Force \nrecommendations does not convert Task \nForce members into federal officers subject \nto the Appointments Clause. \nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution \nsets out the methods for validly installing \u201cOfficers of \nthe United States,\u201d including any \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Respondents here argue \nthat the structure of the Task Force violates the \nAppointments Clause. In the court of appeals, \nhowever, neither the parties nor the court addressed \nthe threshold question whether the Task Force \nmembers are federal \u201cofficers\u201d who are subject to the \nAppointments Clause in the first place, as the parties \n\u201cdispute[d] only whether Task Force members are \n\u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. The \ncourt then held that the Task Force members are \n\u201cprincipal officers of the United States who have not \nbeen validly appointed under \u2026 [the] Constitution,\u201d \nid. at 2a, and enjoined Petitioners from requiring \nRespondents to comply with the ACA\u2019s directive to \nprovide cost-free coverage for preventive services that \nthe Task Force has recommended since the ACA\u2019s \nenactment or will recommend in the future, see id. at \n47a. But despite the parties\u2019 agreement below, this \nCourt should address the threshold question, \nencompassed in the first question presented, whether \nTask Force members are officers at all. They are not. \nNot every person who occupies a role set out in a \nfederal statute is an officer of the United States. The \nconcept of an office \u201cembraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties\u201d that are \u201ccontinuing \nand permanent, not occasional or temporary.\u201d United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511\u201312 (1878). And \neven where a person occupies a federal position that \n\n \n9 \ndoes hold these characteristics, that person is not \nsubject to the Appointments Clause\u2019s requirements if \nthe person\u2019s statutory duties entail \u201cappropriate \nlegislative functions\u201d or objective expert factfinding, \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 128 (1976) (per curiam), \nrather than \u201csignificant authority\u201d to execute or \nenforce federal law, id. at 126. Here, Task Force \nmembers are not federal officers, both because they do \nnot hold federal offices and, in any event, because \ntheir circumscribed factfinding roles would not bring \nthem within the ambit of the Appointments Clause. \nA. Nearly 150 years ago, this Court held in a pair \nof cases that a person who periodically performs \nspecific tasks that aid the government is not an officer \nsubject to the Appointments Clause. See Auffmordt v. \nHedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326\u201328 (1890); Germaine, 99 \nU.S. at 512. In reaching this holding, Germaine and \nAuffmordt relied on the definition of a \u201cpublic officer\u201d \nin this Court\u2019s seminal decision in United States v. \nHartwell, 73 U.S. 385 (1868). There, the Court \nequated an \u201cofficer\u201d with one who holds an \u201coffice,\u201d \nand went on to say: \u201cAn office is a public station, or \nemployment, conferred by the appointment of \ngovernment. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties.\u201d Id. at 393. \nApplying that understanding of the term, Germaine \nand Auffmordt held the Appointments Clause \ninapplicable to persons who performed work to aid the \ngovernment but were not appointed to emp\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n33: 20241218143750304_Braidwood-Cert_Reply-24-316.json (score: 0.371)\nNo. 24-316  \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n \nXAVIER BECERRA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND  \nHUMAN SERVICES, ET AL., PETITIONERS \nv. \nBRAIDWOOD MANAGEMENT, INC., ET AL. \n \nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS \n \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

The Fifth Circuit nonetheless erroneously held \nthat Task Force members are principal officers who \nmust be appointed by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.  And the court compounded its \nerror by then declining to sever the lone provision that, \nin its view, insulated the Task Force from secretarial \nsupervision.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision defies this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, declares an important federal stat-\nutory provision unconstitutional, and jeopardizes health-\ncare protections enjoyed by millions of Americans un-\nder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(ACA), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119.  \n\n2 \n \nAlthough respondents defend the judgment below on \nthe merits, they \u201cagree with the Solicitor General that \nthe Court should grant the petition for certiorari\u201d be-\ncause \u201c[t]he court of appeals determined that a key pro-\nvision of the Affordable Care Act violates Article II\u2019s \nAppointments Clause.\u201d  Br. in Support of Cert. 1.  The \nCourt should accordingly grant the petition and reverse \nthe judgment below.    \nA. Respondents Agree That The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision \nWarrants This Court\u2019s Review \nThe petition demonstrates (at 27-33) that the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision warrants review.  That decision held \nthat \u201cconstitutional problems  * * *  inhere in the Task \nForce\u2019s\u201d structure, Pet. App. 30a, and \u201cwhen a lower \ncourt has invalidated a federal statute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \n\u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant review, Iancu v. Brunetti, \n588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019).  The court of appeals\u2019 decision \nalso threatens to upend a key part of the ACA that pro-\nvides preventive-services coverage without cost- \nsharing for millions of Americans.   \nRespondents\u2019 brief supporting certiorari correctly \nrecognizes that the court of appeals declared unconsti-\ntutional \u201ca key provision of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d \nand that \u201cthis Court\u2019s usual practice\u201d in such circum-\nstances \u201cis to grant certiorari without awaiting a circuit \nsplit.\u201d  Br. in Support of Cert. 1; see id. at 19-20.  While \nrespondents characterize (id. at 2) our arguments about \nthe practical consequences of the decision below as \n\u201cdire predictions,\u201d they never explain how or why those \narguments are incorrect.  And numerous amici agree \nwith our assessment of the practical stakes.  See Amer-\nican Pub.

In any event, \n\n3 \n \nrespondents acknowledge (Br. in Support of Cert. 2) \nthat any \u201cdisagreements\u201d about the consequences of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision do not \u201caffect the certworthi-\nness of this case.\u201d \nThe petition further demonstrates (at 30-31) that ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, a future plaintiff with Article \nIII standing could sue in the Fifth Circuit and obtain a \nuniversal remedy as the default under circuit prece-\ndent, thus rendering the Task Force preventive- \nservices scheme inoperative nationwide.  Respondents \nlikewise recognize (Br. in Support of Cert. 22) that risk \nand agree that this Court should \u201cgrant certiorari be-\nfore allowing\u201d a lower court to grant such a universal \nremedy.1  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Wrong \nRespondents also contend (Br. in Support of Cert. \n24-34) that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct.  A \ncomplete discussion of the merits can await the full \nbriefing and argument that both parties agree is war-\nranted.  But respondents\u2019 discussion of the merits offers \nno persuasive defense of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  \n \n1 Respondents propose (Br. in Support of Cert. i) to split the pe-\ntition\u2019s question presented into two separate questions\u2014with one \naddressing the Appointments Clause and the other addressing sev-\nerability.  Respondents\u2019 proposal is unnecessary because the Ap-\npointments Clause and severability issues are both already ex-\npressly included in the petition\u2019s question presented, see Pet. i, and \ndividing them into two questions would neither alter the issues be-\nfore the Court nor otherwise aid the Court\u2019s consideration of the \ncase.  But to the extent the Court prefers respondents\u2019 formulation, \nit should grant certiorari on both of respondents\u2019 questions pre-\nsented to ensure that both the Appointments Clause and severabil-\nity issues are properly before the Court.       \n\n4 \n \n1. Task Force members are inferior officers because \nthe Secretary may remove them at will; and to the ex-\ntent further means of secretarial oversight were re-\nquired, the Secretary also has the authority to \u201csuper-\nvis[e] and direct[]\u201d the Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. \n202, which includes the Task Force.  See also Reorgan-\nization Plan No. 3 of 1966 (Reorganization Plan), \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), \n2, 80 Stat. 1610.  Respondents do not dispute that the \nSecretary may remove Task Force members at will.  \nNor do they cite any case in which an official who was \nremovable at will by a principal officer was herself a \nprincipal officer.  Instead, they seek to downplay (Br. in \nSupport of Cert. 27) removability as \u201cmerely one factor\u201d \nin the inferior-officer analysis.  But even the Fifth Cir-\ncuit recognized that \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cthe \nmost important\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  And beyond removability, respondents entirely ig-\nnore the Secretary\u2019s additional express authority to su-\npervise and direct the Public Health Service. \nRespondents contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 27) \nthat Task Force members\u2019 recommendations are \u201cnot \nsubject to review or reversal\u201d by the HHS Secretary \nbecause 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6) requires that those rec-\nommendations \u201cbe independent and, to the extent prac-\nticable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  As the certi-\norari petition explains (at 19-20), however, the statutory \nreference to independence and freedom from political \npressure simply requires that Task Force members \nmake unbiased and evidence-based recommendations, \neven while those recommendations remain subject to \nsecretarial review.  Respondents do not explain why such \na scheme is unconstitutional\u2014particularly given that \nadministrative law judges and immigration judges, who \noperate under similar structures and exercise their \n\n5 \n \nindependent judgment, properly serve as inferior offic-\ners.  Pet. 20.     \nRespondents also insist (Br. in Support of Cert. 31) \nthat Task Force members must be principal officers be-\ncause the Secretary cannot \u201cdirect\u201d their recommenda-\ntions in the first instance.  That argument cannot be \nsquared with Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 \n(1997), where this Court held that judges of the Coast \nGuard Court of Criminal Appeals were inferior officers \neven though no superior could \u201cattempt to influence (by \nthreat of removal or otherwise) the outcome of individ-\nual proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 664.  \u201cWhat [wa]s significant\u201d \nin Edmond\u2014and what is significant here\u2014was that the \nofficials at issue had \u201cno power to render a final decision \non behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so \nby\u201d a principal officer.  Id. at 665.  Cf. Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52, 135 (1926) (explaining that while \n\u201cthe President can not in a particular case properly in-\nfluence or control\u201d certain \u201cquasi judicial\u201d decisions of \nexecutive officers, \u201che may consider the decision after \nits rendition as a reason for removing the officer\u201d).       \n \nRespondents further argue (Br. in Support of Cert. \n29) that even if the government\u2019s interpretation of Sec-\ntion 299b-4(a)(6) is correct, an Appointments Clause \nproblem still exists because \u201cCongress has not \u2018vested\u2019 \nSecretary Becerra with appointment authority over the \nTask Force.\u201d  The Fifth Circuit did not embrace that \nargument, and for good reason.  Multiple statutory pro-\nvisions empower the Secretary to appoint Task Force \nmembers.  First, the Secretary may appoint Task Force \nmembers when \u201cacting through the Director\u201d of the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), \n42 U.S.C. 299(a), who normally convenes the Task \nForce, 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  See United States v. \n\n6 \n \nHartwell, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 385, 393-394 (1868) (holding \nthat a similar statutory provision properly vested ap-\npointment authority in a principal officer).  Second, the \nSecretary may appoint Task Force members when per-\nforming \u201call functions of the Public Health Service\u201d and \nits \u201cofficers\u201d\u2014including the AHRQ Director\u2014and when \n\u201cmak[ing] such provisions as he shall deem appropriate \nauthorizing the performance of any of the functions  \n* * *  of the Public Health Service.\u201d  Reorganization \nPlan, \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And even if the Secre-\ntary\u2019s appointment authority were ambiguous, this \nCourt should adopt the government\u2019s \u201creasonable inter-\npretation\u201d recognizing such authority over respond-\nents\u2019 suggestion that Congress impermissibly and con-\nclusively vested appointment authority of inferior offic-\ners (Task Force members) in a different inferior officer \n(the AHRQ Director).  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 658; see \nibid. (applying the constitutional-avoidance canon to \nhold that Congress vested appointment of inferior offic-\ners in a principal officer).     \n2. Assuming this Court were to conclude that Task \nForce members are unconstitutionally insulated from \nsecretarial direction and supervision, it should sever \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) to cure the constitutional defect.  \nThat approach follows directly from this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1 (2021).  See \nPet. 22-27.  Respondents hardly grapple with Arthrex\u2014\nlet alone show why its logic should not control the sev-\nerability analysis here.   \nInstead, respondents argue (Br. in Support of Cert. \n33) that severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not cure \nthe constitutional defect because the Secretary would \nstill lack the \u201cability to review or countermand [the \nTask Force\u2019s] decisions not to adopt an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nrecommendation.\u201d  But the Secretary\u2019s lack of review \nover Task Force inaction does not violate the Constitu-\ntion.  If the Task Force determines that an item or ser-\nvice should not receive an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating, then no \nhealth plan is required to cover it under 42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1), and there is thus no exercise of federal \nauthority over any private party.   \nFinally, respondents object (Br. in Support of Cert. \n33-34) to the entire enterprise of severability.  But this \nCourt has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c\u200a\u2018when confront-\ning a constitutional flaw in a statute, [it] tr[ies] to limit \nthe solution to the problem\u2019 by disregarding the \u2018prob-\nlematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 23 (quoting Ayotte v. Planned \nParenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 328-329 \n(2006)).  And the Court has consistently applied that ap-\nproach in separation of powers cases after identifying a \nconstitutional defect.  See id. at 23-27; Seila Law LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 234-238 (2020) (plurality opin-\nion); Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Over-\nsight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 508-510 (2010).  To the extent \nthe Court believes that the Task Force\u2019s current struc-\nture is unconstitutional, it should follow the same course \nhere.2   \n \n \n2 Respondents briefly suggest (Br. in Support of Cert. 34) that \nsevering Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not \u201credress [their] Article III \ninjuries.\u201d  But the Court should adhere to its normal practice of find-\ning the defective provision severable and then remanding for con-\nsideration of the proper relief (if any) that should be provided to the \nplaintiffs.  See Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 259-260 (2021); Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 238 (plurality opinion); Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 514.   \n\n8 \n \n* * * * * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the pe-\ntition for a writ of certiorari, the Court should grant the \npetition. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, Pub. L. No. 111\u2013148, 124 Stat. 119, health \ninsurance issuers and group health plans must cover \ncertain preventive services recommended by the Task \nForce without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on \npatients. 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1). The question presented \nis as follows:\nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appointments \nClause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7\u00a02, Cl. 2, and in declining \nto sever the statutory provision that it found to unduly \ninsulate the Task Force from the HHS Secretary\u2019s \nsupervision.\n\nii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nQUESTION PRESENTED .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nTABLE OF CONTENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . iv\nIDENTITY AND INTEREST OF AMICUS \n\t\nCURIAE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \n\t\nARGUMENT  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nARGUMENT .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nI. \t The inferior / superior distinction does \nnot turn exclusively on an officer\u2019s \n\t\nremovability  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nA. \t The distinction depends on \u201cwhere \nthe buck stops,\u201d not on removability \n\t\nalone .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nB. \t The Court should not make removability \n\t\nthe dispositive consideration .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . 10\nII. \t The \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d clause \n\t\ncannot salvage the statute .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . 12\n\niii\nTable of Contents\nPage\nIII. \tThe policy arguments of the medical \namici cannot overcome the constitutional \n\t\nmandate .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\nCONCLUSION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\niv\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES\nPage\nCases\nBiden v.

Among the most familiar is \nthe separation of governmental powers into legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches. Less apparent, but \nequally important, are provisions such as the Appointments \nClause, which helps implement the separation of powers \nprinciple by ensuring that legislative and executive \nauthority are not exercised by the same people, let alone \nby people insulated from democratic accountability. At its \ncore, \u201cthe principle of separation of powers is embedded \nin the Appointments Clause.\u201d Freytag v. C.I.R., 501 U.S. \n868, 882 (1991).\nUnfortunately, Congress has a strong incentive to \nfind ways to give away its power\u2014and therefore, its \nresponsibility\u2014to officials or agencies that are shielded \nfrom voter control. And when Congress enacted, and \nPresident Obama signed, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), they left much work to be \ndone by executive agencies, including the creation of rules \ngoverning insurance coverage for preventive healthcare \nservices and the assignment of financial responsibility for \n3.\u2002 https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA700.\npdf.\n\n3\nthose services. Congress entrusted these questions to the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (\u201cPSTF\u201d \nor \u201cTask Force\u201d), a group of unelected subject matter \nexperts whose independence from political pressure \nwas to be secured \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0299b-4(a)(6).\nCongress created the PSTF in 1984 as a panel of \nmedical specialty authorities with technical expertise \nin disease prevention. The Task Force works to \nimprove the public\u2019s health by making evidence-based \nrecommendations about clinical preventive services.4 It \nwas given no inherent authority. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299b-4(a). \nNevertheless, Section 2713 of the ACA requires private \ninsurers to cover the cost of all preventive services for \nwhich the Task Force assigns a grade of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d \n(meaning a high certainty that the net benefit is either \nsubstantial or moderate). Such services must be paid for \nby insurers with no cost-sharing (i.e., no deductibles or \nco-payments).5 In other words, the ACA transformed what \nhad previously been a powerless advisory body, created to \nmake recommendations based on its members\u2019 technical \nexpertise, into a government agency with law-making \npowers.\nBut the Constitution\u2014and specifically, the \nAppointments Clause\u2014forbids the government from \ngiving such authority to people who are not \u201caccountable \nto political force and the will of the people.\u201d Freytag, 501 \nU.S. at 884.\n4.\u2002 https://tinyurl.com/3a9ajkb9.\n5.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nus-preventive-services-task-force-ratings.\n\n4\nAt issue here is whether members of the PSTF \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be \nappointed through the Senate-confirmation process, or \nwhether they are \u201cinferior\u201d officers whose appointment \nCongress can entrust to the President alone, or to the \nheads of departments. U.S. Const. art. II \u00a7\u00a02. For many \nyears this Court has used a functional test to distinguish \nbetween superior and inferior officers. This test involved \nseveral factors including the degree of discretion the \nofficers exercise, the content of the work they do, and \ntheir removability. But the government here takes a \nformalistic approach to the question, arguing that officials \nwhose dictates are ipso facto the law of the land are not \nofficers of the United States, based exclusively on the fact \nthat they are removable by the Secretary. That, however, \nis contrary to the realistic or functional approach this \nCourt has taken for more than a century. The fact that \nan official is removable at will cannot alone determine the \n\u201csuperior\u201d / \u201cinferior\u201d classification. Instead, the scope of \nthat officer\u2019s powers is also an important factor.\nWhat\u2019s more, the whole purpose of the Task Force \nis to exercise independent judgment. It is logically \ncontradictory to assert that the Task Force is independent \nand unsupervised, but also subject to the political \nprocess through the Secretary. Yet that is in substance \nthe government\u2019s argument, when it contends that the \nphrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d in the ACA (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0 299b-4(a)(6)) cures the constitutional violation by \nincorporating the requirements of checks and balances \ninto the PSTF\u2019s structure. See, e.g., Pet. at 21. To interpret \nthe statute that way is to rob the Task Force of its very \nreason for being. The government cannot have it both \nways.\n\n5\nFinally, numerous medical group amici argued \nbelow that significant benefits to public health are at \nstake in this case. Certainly, improving public health is \na core purpose for the PSTF and the preventive health \nservice recommendations, and those amici are right that \nthe PSTF\u2019s work affects preventive healthcare services \nfor millions of Americans. \u201cBut this argument, which \nboils down to a policy judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot vitiate the \nconstitutional allocation of powers.\u201d Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 132\u201333 (2015) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring). Such arguments are properly addressed \nto Congress, to persuade it to restructure the PSTF in \na constitutional manner. They cannot, however, justify \ndiverting from the Constitution\u2019s mandates.\nARGUMENT\nI. \t The inferior / superior distinction does not turn \nexclusively on an officer\u2019s removability.\nA. \t The distinction depends on \u201cwhere the buck \nstops,\u201d not on removability alone.\nThe Appointments Clause requires Senate \nconfirmation for principal officers of the United States, \nsuch as diplomats and judges, but lets Congress give the \nresponsibility of appointing \u201cinferior officers\u201d (of which \nthe text provides no examples) to the President, or to the \nheads of departments, or to the courts alone. U.S. Const. \nart. II \u00a7\u00a02.\nThe original meaning of \u201cofficers\u201d included any \nperson with significant responsibility for enforcing \nstatutory duties. Jennifer Mascott, Who Are \u201cOfficers of \n\n6\nthe United States\u201d? 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, 471\u2013545 (2018). \nThis included even government employees engaged in \nministerial tasks. The distinction between \u201cprincipal\u201d and \n\u201cinferior,\u201d meanwhile, has long turned on the substance \nof that person\u2019s responsibilities. For example, in United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. (9 Otto) 508, 511\u201312 (1878), \nthis Court described the difference between principal and \ninferior officers by reference to their \u201ctenure, duration, \nemolument, and duties.\u201d\nA century later, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), \nreiterated the Court\u2019s substantive or functional approach \nto distinguishing inferior from principal when it held \nthat commissioners of the Federal Election Commission \n(FEC) were not constitutionally appointed. It said that \nthe question turned on whether the purported officer was \n\u201cexercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Id. at 126.\nSome cases have used a more formalistic analysis, \nhowever, suggesting that the decisive factor in \ndetermining whether an officer is inferior or superior is \nremovability. This has caused considerable confusion. See \nDamien M. Schiff & Oliver J. Dunford, Distinguishing \nBetween Inferior and Non-Inferior Officers Under the \nAppointments Clause\u2014A Question of \u201cSignificance,\u201d 74 \nRutgers U.L. Rev. 469, 506\u201307 (2022).\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010), for example, rightly \nwarned of the danger that \u201cthe Executive Branch, which \nnow wields vast power and touches almost every aspect \nof daily life, .\u00a0.\u00a0. may slip from the Executive\u2019s control, \nand thus from that of the people,\u201d id. at 499, but it \n\n7\ndecided the inferior/principal question based exclusively \non removability. Id. at 495\u201396. And Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651 (1997), seemingly treated removability \nthe only relevant factor\u2014declaring, for example, that \n\u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether \nhe has a superior.\u201d Id. at 662. Although Justice Souter \nhastened to add that \u201c[i]t does not follow .\u00a0.\u00a0. that if one is \nsubject to some supervision and control, one is an inferior \nofficer,\u201d no other justice joined his opinion. Id. at 667 \n(Souter, J., concurring).\nMore recently, however, the Court has appeared to \nreturn to the more holistic approach recommended in \nBuckley\u2014one that views removability not as decisive \nbut only indicative. Thus, United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1 (2021), answered the question of whether the \nAdministrative Patent Judges (APJ) serving on the Patent \nTrial and Appeal Board (PTAB) were inferior or principal \nofficers by considering factors besides mere removability. \nInstead, the question was whether the decisions of APJs \nwere subject to review by the Director. Id. at 26. This \nCourt said that \u201cregardless [of] whether the Government \nis correct that at-will removal by the Secretary would cure \nthe constitutional problem, review by the Director better \nreflects the structure of supervision within the PTO and \nthe nature of APJs\u2019 duties.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nThe lower court in Arthrex had declared that it was \nenough to declare the tenure provision of the act at issue \nunconstitutional, but this Court held otherwise. Mere \nremovability, it said, gave the Director no \u201cmeans of \ncountermanding the final decision already on the books.\u201d \nId. at 16. That meant that \u201c[i]n all the ways that matter to \nthe parties who appear before the PTAB, the buck stops \n\n8\nwith the APJs, not with the Secretary or Director.\u201d Id. \nat 17.\nThe same is true, of course, of the PSTF. Its \nmembers are appointed by the Secretary to four-year \nterms. New members are selected each year to replace \nthose completing their terms. Thus, although individual \nappointments are time-limited, the duties of the 16 \nmembers of the Task Force are continuing and ongoing.6 \nAnd their decisions are where the buck stops. Section 2713 \nof the ACA, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13 and embodied in \nregulation at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a02590.715\u20132713(a)(1)(i), mandates \nthat group health plans and health insurers offer group \nhealth insurance, provide coverage, and not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements for, items and services having \nan \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating in current recommendations of the \nPSTF.\nBut the PSTF\u2019s structure is even more defiant of the \nconstitutional order than was the PTAB in Arthrex. As the \ncourt below observed, the PSTF is \u201cnot part of HHS or any \nfederal agency,\u201d and therefore the decisions of its members \nare not automatically subject to secretarial oversight. Pet. \nApp. 81a. So, even more than in Arthrex, the buck stops \nnot with an official who is subject to Senate confirmation, \nbut with the \u201cvolunteers\u201d who serve on PSTF.\nNot only are the decisions of the PSTF members \neffectively final, but the nature and scope of those \ndecisions is significant. Since at least Germaine, and \ncertainly since Buckley, this Court has found that one \n6.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nabout-uspstf/current-members.\n\n9\nfactor in determining who is a superior or inferior officer \nis the substantive effect of that person\u2019s discretionary \nauthority. \u201cLesser functionaries\u201d carrying out minor \ntasks may not qualify, but anyone entrusted to \u201cexercis[e] \nsignificant authority pursuant to the laws\u201d is likely a \nprincipal officer. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126 & n.162. Arthrex \nrightly recognized that removability is not dispositive; the \nsubstantive impact of the officer\u2019s decision-making power \nis also key. Thus \u201ceven when a higher-ranking officer has \nsubstantial direction and supervision over other officers \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the latter are not inferior officers if they exercise \nsignificant authority\u2014most prominently, final decision-\nmaking authority\u2014on behalf of the Executive Branch.\u201d \nSchiff & Dunford, supra at 513.\nThe most recent list of recommendations includes 14 \nservices rated \u201cA\u201d and 40 rated \u201cB.\u201d7 According to a 2022 \nreport from the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning \nand Evaluation, 150 million people with private health \ninsurance can receive these preventive services without \ncost-sharing. Access to Preventive Services without Cost-\nSharing: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act (ASPE \nOffice of Health Policy Brief HP-2022-01, Jan. 11, 2022) \nat 1.8 The Task Force\u2019s ability to order health insurers to \ncover the cost, without cost-sharing, of over 50 preventive \nhealth services for nearly half the country\u2019s population is \ncertainly a significant power. And the fact that Congress \nexpressly designed the Task Force to be independent\u2014\nmandating that it \u201cshall be independent,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0299b-4(a)(6)\u2014means that its members exercise their \n7.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nrecommendation-topics/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations. \n8.\u2002 https://tinyurl.com/38vdp3r4.\n\n10\nauthority without meaningful oversight by responsible, \nSenate-confirmed superiors. On these issues, the buck \nstops with them.\nB. \t The Court should not make removability the \ndispositive consideration.\nIn Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018), this Court \nconsidered whether administrative law judges (ALJs) \nwith career appointments, chosen by the staff of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), were \nofficers who must be appointed in accordance with the \nAppointment Clause. Once again, the Court employed a \nfunctionalist, multi-factor analysis, not a formalistic test \nbased solely on removability. Echoing the significant-\nauthority test from Buckley, it said that ALJs not only \n\u201c[held] a continuing office established by law,\u201d but that \nthey also \u201cexercise .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . \u2019significant discretion\u2019 when \ncarrying out .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2019important functions.\u2019\u201d Id. at 247\u201348 \n(quoting Freytag, 501 U.S. at 878). Specifically, the ALJs \ncould receive evidence, examine witnesses, and regulate \nthe course of proceedings and the behavior of counsel, \ndecide motions, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and \neven enforce compliance with discovery orders. Id. at \n248. Their \u201cduties and powers\u201d were therefore significant \nenough that, combined with other considerations, they \nwere officers of the United States who must go through \nSenate confirmation. Id.\nThis consideration of the substantive duties and \npowers of the officer, rather than a single-minded focus \non removability, is crucial for at least three reasons. \nFirst, an officer who is theoretically removable may be \neffectively unremovable due to various circumstances. \n\n11\nTo make removability the determinative factor would \nenable Congress to vest officials with immense power\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n56: 20241021182145734_Braidwood20Brief20in20Support20of20Certiorari20PDFA.json (score: 0.370)\nNo. 24-316 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n_____________ \nXAVIER BECERRA, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN \nSERVICES, ET AL., PETITIONERS \n \nv. \n \nBRAIDWOOD MANAGEMENT, INC., ET AL., RESPONDENTS \n_____________ \nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  \n_____________ \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF CERTIORARI \n_____________ \nGENE P.

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

Becerra, No. 23-\n10326 (5th Cir.), ECF No. 159, at 30, available at \nhttp://bit.ly/40b9IFt [https://perma.cc/SYK3-FPBA] (\u201cAlthough \nthe existing Task Force members have not yet received an ap-\npointment consistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secre-\ntary has authority to appoint Task Force members and is in the \nprocess of providing them with a constitutional appointment.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n9\ncause the Task Force served as a purely advisory com-\nmittee before the ACA, its members did not wield \u201csig-\nnificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d9 and did not qualify as \u201cofficers of the United \nStates\u201d under Article II of the Constitution. See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126; see also Jennifer L. Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443 (2018). \n\n \n \n \n11 \nSenate\u2019s advice and consent, rather than \u201cinferior\u201d offic-\ners who can be appointed by a Head of Department. Pet. \nApp. 115a\u2013116a; see also U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2 (\u201c[B]ut \nthe Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \ninterior officers, as they think proper, in the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments.\u201d). The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, A & B \nRecommendations, https://bit.ly/3JnxC7m (last visited Feb. 9, \n2025). \n4 Assistant Sec\u2019y for Plan. and Eval., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human \nServices, Access to Preventive Services Without Cost-Sharing: \n\n3 \n \n \nThe United States petitioned for certiorari on the \nquestion of whether the structure of the Task Force \nviolates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution.  This Court granted the government\u2019s \npetition on January 10, 2025.   \nAs economists, amici know that invalidating or \notherwise calling into question the validity of the \nProvision will impose significant costs on individuals, the \nhealth care system, and the larger economy.  In the \nlower \ncourts, \nRespondents \nargued \n\u201c[t]here \nis \nconsiderable \ntension \nbetween \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ninsistence that these preventive-care services are \nvaluable and its simultaneous assumption that people \nwill lose coverage for those services or decline to pay for \nthem if co-pays are added.\u201d5  As we explain, economic \nprinciples rebut this assertion \u2014 there is no such \ntension.  \nAccordingly, Amici write to make three points in \nurging this Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nas to legality of the USPSTF.  First, the Provision rests \non a strong economic foundation.  From an economic \nperspective, optimal insurance design incentivizes high-\nvalue care and deters low-value care.  As we explain, \npreventive services are high value, producing significant \nhealth and economic benefits.  These services are \nprecisely the ones that society should want individuals \n \n \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3Js5bFv. \n5 Response to Motion for a Partial Stay of Final Judgment Pending \nAppeal at 15, ECF No. 66. \n\n4 \n \n \nto use because they generate better health outcomes \nover time at low cost.  Those benefits would be lost if \ninsurers and employers were allowed to drop high-value \nservices at their discretion or reimpose cost-sharing, \nparticularly given the substantial research showing that \ncost-sharing strongly deters individuals from obtaining \nservices regardless of their value.    \nSecond, requiring this coverage solves a market \nproblem.  In the U.S. health care system, individuals \nregularly move in and out of different insurance plans.  \nAs a result, no single insurer or group health plan has \nthe full economic incentive to provide coverage for \npreventive care because the cost-savings generated by \nthat care \u2014 for example, the lower cost of treating \ncancers detected earlier \u2014 typically accrue in the future, \noften to a different insurer or employer-sponsored group \nhealth plan.  This asymmetry belies Respondents\u2019 \ncontentions below that, if these services are in fact \nvaluable, insurers and employers will continue to \nprovide the current level of coverage or that consumers \ncan and will pay for these services in the Provision\u2019s \nabsence.6    \nThis problem is particularly acute given the large \nrole Medicare plays in our health insurance system.  \nMedicare guarantees coverage for most U.S. individuals \nwhen they turn 65.  Private insurers know that their \ncustomers are likely to switch to Medicare at that age, \nwhich makes insurers less likely to take on the \nimmediate costs of preventive care because the savings \n \n \n6 See id. \n\n5 \n \n \nare disproportionately realized as the person ages.  That \nin turn leaves Medicare \u2014 and ultimately the taxpayer \n\u2014 to bear the increased costs of an aging population in \npoorer health and with a pent-up demand for services.  \nRequiring private insurers and employer plans to cover \npreventive care helps correct the skewed incentives \ncreated by a fragmented market.   \nThird, and finally, the overall economy benefits from \ninvestment in prevention.  When preventive measures \nforestall disease or detect it earlier, individuals live \nlonger, \nmore \neconomically \nproductive \nlives.  \nLongstanding health economics research has quantified \nthe high economic value of many of the preventive \nservices covered through the Provision.  Without the \nProvision, utilization of preventive care will decrease as \nindividuals respond to increased cost-sharing, as they \npredictably and consistently do, by forgoing care.  That \ndecline in the usage of proven high-value care would \ntranslate into substantial economic loss in the form of \nlost lives and lost years of work. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Preventive Services Provision Rests on Sound \nEconomic Principles Specific to Preventive Care. \nThe ACA\u2019s Preventive Services Provision reflects \ndecades of health economics research regarding the \nadvantages and drawbacks of cost-sharing.  Insurers \nand employers impose cost-sharing to transfer some of \nthe economic burden posed by the generally high cost of \nhealth care services from the insurer or employer to the \nenrollee.  Cost-sharing comes in multiple forms: (1) a co-\npayment, a set amount charged to the consumer at the \n\n6 \n \n \npoint of service; (2) co-insurance, a percentage of the cost \nof a service for which the consumer is responsible; or (3) \na deductible, an annual dollar amount the consumer must \npay for health care services prior to insurance paying out \nclaims.  The cost-cutting effect of cost-sharing, from the \nperspective of the insurer or employer, is not only due to \nthe \nincreased \ndollar \namount \nthe \ninsured \nnow \ncontributes, but also the resulting decrease in health \ncare utilization and the corresponding reduction in total \nclaims the insurer or employer must pay.  Cost-sharing \nhas this depressive effect on utilization because it raises \nthe price of insured care for consumers.  \nStudies consistently demonstrate that individuals \nseek out fewer health care services, across the spectrum \nof care, in response to cost-sharing.  As the landmark \nRAND Health Insurance Experiment found in the \n1970s, enrollees in health plans with higher levels of \ncost-sharing spent less on health care because they \ninitiated fewer episodes of care.7  A recent survey found \nthat 60 percent of adults in employer plans who either \nhad high out-of-pocket costs or deductibles relative to \ntheir income reported not obtaining needed health care \ndue to cost.8  A study of a large self-insured employer\u2019s \nshift from a plan that offered free care to a high \n \n \n7 Amelia Haviland et al., Skin in the Game: How Consumer-\nDirected Plans Affect the Cost and Use of Health Care, RAND \nCorporation (2012), https://bit.ly/46e82eZ. \n8 Sara R. Collins & Avni Gupta, The State of Health Insurance \nCoverage in the U.S., Commonwealth Fund (Nov. 2024), \nhttps://bit.ly/42OQ57q.   \n\n7 \n \n \ndeductible plan found that enrollees reduced spending \nfor all types of care, including high-value services like \npreventive care.9  \nSome argue in favor of cost-sharing and its effects on \nthe basis that it deters insured consumers from over-\npurchasing health care services as a result of insurance \ncovering the cost of the service rather than the \nconsumers themselves.10  However, regardless of one\u2019s \nview of this argument when applied to health care \nservices in general, it is an ill-fit for the high-value \npreventive services covered by the Provision.  The \napplication of cost-sharing to these types of services \nleads patients, particularly those with tight budgets, to \nbehave in ways not in the best interest of their health \nand ability to lead long, economically productive lives.   \nTailored cost-sharing that varies based on the type \nof service provided reflects value-based insurance \ndesign (\u201cV-BID\u201d).  V-BID constitutes an approach to \nhealth insurance that aims to incentivize patients and \nproviders to seek out more valuable services in terms of \ntheir cost-effectiveness, i.e., the relationship between \nthe cost of the service and the medical benefit it \n \n \n9 Zarek C. Brot-Goldberg et al., What does a Deductible Do? The \nImpact of Cost-Sharing on Health Care Prices, Quantities, and \nSpending Dynamics, 132 Q. J. Econ. 1261 (2017).   \n10 John A.

V-BID has proven effective in \nshaping consumer behavior.  Studies have demonstrated \nthat reducing or eliminating cost-sharing for certain \nprescription drugs or treatments for specific diseases or \nchronic conditions is associated with desired changes in \ntargeted utilization.12  \nPreventive care provides the quintessential example \nof a category of health care services that requires \neconomic incentives to influence optimal consumer \nbehavior.  For the reasons set forth in this brief, \npreventive services provide substantial economic \nbenefits.  Consumers may fail to fully take these benefits \ninto account because these benefits largely accrue in the \nfuture.13  As the above studies demonstrate, consumers \n \n \n11 Am. Med.

Data from the \nFederal Reserve shows that in 2023, nearly four in ten \nadults with less than $25,000 in family income had one or \nmore bills that they could not pay in full that month, or \nwere one $400 financial setback away from being unable \nto pay their bills.14  Numerous studies have shown that \n\u201ceven relatively small levels of cost sharing, in the range \nof $1 to $5, are associated with reduced use of care, \nincluding necessary services.\u201d15  One study found that \n \n \ncentral finding of behavioral economics is that people tend to \nunderinvest in these sorts of activity, placing excessive weight on \ncurrent-period costs and underweighting next-period benefits.\u201d).

Rev. \n693 (1976) ........................................................................ 23 \n \n \n\n \n(1) \nINTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE \nStates have a vital interest in \u201cprotecting [the] sepa-\nration of powers by curtailing unlawful executive action.\u201d \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187 (5th Cir. 2015), \naff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 579 U.S. 547 (2016) \n(per curiam). States regularly file amicus briefs to vindi-\ncate that interest, with the \u201cultimate purpose\u201d of \u201cpro-\ntect[ing] the liberty and security of the governed.\u201d \nMetro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for Abatement \nof Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 272 (1991). \nStates have a special interest, moreover, in ensuring \nthat those who wield federal power are properly ap-\npointed. On its face, the Appointments Clause protects \nStates by ensuring that no officer can be appointed with-\nout the Senate\u2019s consent or, at a minimum, without legis-\nlation vesting the appointment \u201cin the President alone, \nin the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2; see also Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 660-61 (1997) (\u201cThe prescribed man-\nner of appointment for principal officers is also the de-\nfault manner of appointment for inferior officers.\u201d). Be-\ncause every State enjoys equal representation in the \nSenate, and because the difficulty of navigating bicamer-\nalism and presentment inherently benefits the States, \nthese structural safeguards help protect States from fed-\neral overreach. \nIn addition, a coalition of States has filed an amicus \nbrief in support of the federal government. Given the im-\nportance of the issues in this litigation, the Court should \nalso hear from States supporting Respondents.1       \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\u201c[T]he very definition of a Republic, is \u2018an Empire of \nLaws, and not of men.\u2019\u201d John Adams, Thoughts on Gov-\nernment (1776). This principle motivates the vertical \nseparation of powers: Congress lacks the States\u2019 \u201cbroad \nauthority to enact legislation for the public good\u2014what \n[courts] have often called a \u2018police power.\u2019\u201d Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 854 (2014) (quoting United \nStates v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995)). It also runs \nthrough the horizontal separation of powers: A federal \nofficial \u201c\u2018literally has no power to act\u2019 \u2026 unless and until \nCongress\u201d confers power to do so. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. \n289, 301 (2022) (quoting La. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, \n476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986)). \nHere, the federal government has amassed an ar-\nmada of amici. Almost all of them, however, advance pol-\nicy arguments why the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce is valuable\u2014not legal arguments why the appoint-\nment of Task Force members comports with the Consti-\ntution. States are mindful of such policy concerns and un-\nderstand why insurers offer coverage for preventive \ncare. In fact, mandates for preventive care often are not \nnecessary precisely because such care can reduce an in-\nsurer\u2019s costs. See, e.g., Greg Goth, Why Broad Preven-\ntive Care Coverage Is Here to Stay, SHRM (Dec. 2, \n2022), https://perma.cc/AX6Q-W8JU (\u201cEven without a \nmandate, employers are unlikely to impose cost-sharing \nfor preventive services.\u201d).  \nCourts, however, are not the forum for policy argu-\nments. Under the Constitution, those who wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d \nare officers who must be appointed consistent with the \nAppointments Clause. Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 \n(2018) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) \n\n3 \n \n(per curiam)). Every principal officer thus must be nom-\ninated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, \nand every inferior officer must be similarly appointed \nunless Congress by law vests their appointment \u201cin the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \nDepartments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  \nAlthough amici States agree with Respondents that \nTask Force members are principal officers, the Court \nneed not reach that issue because\u2014even if they were in-\nferior officers\u2014Congress has not vested their appoint-\nment \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in \nthe Heads of Departments.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the \u201cde-\nfault\u201d rule, Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660, of presidential \nnomination and senatorial confirmation controls. \u201cCalls \nto abandon\u201d separation-of-powers requirements based \non claimed \u201cnecessity are not unusual,\u201d of course, but a \nfederal \u201cjudiciary that licensed extraconstitutional gov-\nernment with each issue of comparable gravity would, in \nthe long run, be far worse.\u201d Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, \n561 U.S. 477, 501 (2010) (quoting New York v. United \nStates, 505 U.S. 144, 187-88 (1992)). \nNot only are Petitioners\u2019 amici\u2019s policy arguments ir-\nrelevant, moreover, they also are overstated. Nothing \nbars the President from nominating Task Force mem-\nbers for senatorial confirmation, which could be accom-\nplished via unanimous consent. And to the extent that the \nTask Force members\u2019 nominations may be controversial \nand so prompt greater debate in the Senate, that point \ncuts in favor of requiring their confirmation, not against \nit. \u201cThe Constitution\u2019s deliberative process was viewed \nby the Framers as a valuable feature, not something to \nbe lamented and evaded.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of \nAm. R.Rs., 575 U.S. 43, 61 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring) \n(citation omitted). \n\n4 \n \nThe federal government does not advance a persua-\nsive counterargument. It does not contend that Task \nForce members aren\u2019t officers. Rather, it argues that \nthey are inferior officers. That distinction is irrelevant to \nthis case. Under the Appointments Clause, the default \nrequirement that the President must nominate and the \nSenate must confirm applies until valid legislation \nchanges that default. Because Congress has not vested \nappointment \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of \nLaw, or in the Heads of Departments,\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nII, \u00a72, cl. 2, with respect to the Task Force, the only \nquestion the Court must answer is whether Task Force \nmembers are officers. Because the federal government \nconcedes (as it must) that they are, the Court need not \ndecide whether (i) they are principal officers and, (ii) if \nso, whether the provisions of statutory law that make \nthem principal officers can be severed as the federal gov-\nernment urges. In all events, severability would be espe-\ncially inappropriate here.  \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Need Not Decide Whether Task Force \nMembers Are Principal Officers. \nAlthough distinguishing between principal and infe-\nrior officers is sometimes necessary, the Court need not \ndo so here. Even if Task Force members are inferior of-\nficers, they still have not been properly appointed be-\ncause Congress has not by law departed from the default \nrule that the President nominates and the Senate con-\nfirms. If following the Constitution\u2019s language proves \ndifficult, Congress can amend the statutes to ensure that \nTask Force members are inferior officers whose appoint-\nment is vested in the President or a department head. \nAppeals to policy thus widely miss the mark.    \n\n5 \n \nA. The Appointments Clause safeguards liberty.  \n1.  Although the Bill of Rights helps protect liberty, \nthe Framers understood that \u201cmere parchment\u201d is not \nenough. The Federalist No. 73, at 441 (Alexander \nHamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). Rather than \nrelying on a list of rights, the Framers created the \nseparation of powers \u201cas the absolutely central \nguarantee of a just Government.\u201d Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 697 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). In so doing, \nthey \u201crecognized that, in the long term, structural \nprotections against abuse of power were critical to \npreserving liberty.\u201d Bowsher v.

LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 213 (2020) (quoting 30 Writings \nof George Washington 334 (J.

Of particular significance, the \n\n6 \n \nConstitution \u201cgive[s] Congress broad authority to \nestablish and organize the Executive Branch.\u201d Id. at 266 \n(Kagan, J., concurring in judgment in part and \ndissenting in part). Although Article II speaks to the \nappointment \nof \ninferior \nofficers \nby \n\u201cHeads \nof \nDepartments,\u201d for example, nowhere does it create any \nsuch departments. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. Thus, \n\u201c[a]lthough the Constitution contemplates\u201d federal \ndepartments and officers, \u201cit clearly requires that those \noffices \u2018shall be established by Law,\u2019\u201d meaning \u201can office \nthat Congress creates \u2018by statute.\u2019\u201d Trump v.

II, \u00a72, cl. 2; and then \nquoting Lucia, 585 U.S. at 254 (Thomas, J., concurring)).  \nThe Framers\u2019 decision to empower Congress to cre-\nate departments and almost all federal executive offices \nwas no accident. \u201cThe limitation on the President\u2019s \npower to create offices grew out of the Founders\u2019 expe-\nrience with the English monarchy,\u201d in which \u201c[t]he King \ncould wield significant power by both creating and filling \noffices as he saw fit\u201d\u2014thus allowing the Crown to \u201ccre-\nate a multitude of offices and then fill them with his sup-\nporters.\u201d Id. (citing, inter alia, Jennifer Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, \n492 (2018)). Abuses of this power so enraged the Colo-\nnists that they included the King\u2019s creation of a \u201cmulti-\ntude of New Offices\u201d in the Declaration of Independence \nitself. Id. at 646 (quoting The Declaration of Independ-\nence \u00b612 (U.S. 1776)).  \nCongress has long exercised authority to create and \nstructure federal departments. For example, in connec-\ntion with the famous Decision of 1789, the First Congress \ndetermined not only that the Department of Foreign Af-\nfairs would be headed by a Secretary, see An Act for \n\n7 \n \nestablishing an Executive Department, to be denomi-\nnated the Department of Foreign Affairs, Jul. 27, 1789, \nch. 4, 1 Stat. 28 \u00a71, but resolved that \u201c[h]e shall receive \nthe applications of all foreigners relative to his depart-\nment,\u201d and \u201cthe books, records, and other papers of the \nUnited States, that relate to this department, [should] be \ncommitted to his custody,\u201d id. \u00a71 n.(a); see also id. \u00a74 \n(\u201c[T]he Secretary \u2026 shall forthwith after his appoint-\nment, be entitled to have the custody and charge of all \nrecords, books and papers in the office.\u201d). Congress also \ndetermined that \u201cthere shall be in the said department, \nan inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal \nofficer,\u201d who would \u201cbe called the chief Clerk in the De-\npartment of Foreign Affairs,\u201d who, during the Secre-\ntary\u2019s \u201cvacancy,\u201d would \u201chave the charge and custody of \nall records, books and papers appertaining to the said de-\npartment.\u201d Id. \u00a72. \nOnce an office is created, the President\u2019s authority \nrespecting that office includes \u201ccontrolling those who \nexecute the laws.\u201d Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 492 \n(quoting 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789) (Joseph Gales ed., \n1834) (remarks of James Madison)). \u201cThe text and \nstructure of Article II provide the President with the \npower to control subordinates within the executive \nbranch.\u201d \nNeomi \nRao, \nRemoval: \nNecessary \nand \nSufficient for Presidential Control, 65 Ala. L. Rev. 1205, \n1215 (2014). Indeed, the President\u2019s authority to control \nthe Executive Branch includes a plenary removal power. \nSee, e.g., Seila L., 591 U.S. at 213-15; Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220, 250 (2021). Otherwise, the President could \nnot fulfill his duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.\u201d Seila L., 591 U.S. at 213 (quoting \nU.S. Const. art.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., No. 4:23-\nCV-24, 2023 WL 5963782 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2023); \nManis v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., No. 24-1367 (4th Cir.).  \nThis brief draws on that experience in support of the \nRespondents\u2019 position that the members of the U.S. \nPreventative Services Task Force function as \nprincipal officers without a proper appointment.  It \npresents a unique perspective tying together this \nCourt\u2019\u200as recent cases on officer status to demonstrate \nthat principal officer review has been consistently \nrequired for decisions by inferior officers that would \notherwise bind the Executive Branch.  This review \nrequirement was recently affirmed in United States v. \nArthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021).  This brief also points \nto Appointments Clause challenges to Executive \nBranch adjudications litigated by PLF in which lower \ncourts \nhave \nignored \nArthrex \nand \npermitted \nadjudications to proceed in the absence of principal \nofficer review.  \nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 23 \n(2021), established that only officers appointed as \nprincipal officers could make final, binding, and \nunreviewable adjudicative decisions for the Executive \nBranch.  This case provides the Court with an \nopportunity to affirm its holding in Arthrex and \nextend \nthat \nrule \nto \nall \nfinal, \nbinding, \nand \nunreviewable decisions of the Executive Branch.  For \ninferior officers making decisions that bind the \nExecutive Branch, principal officer review is the \n\n \n3 \nnecessary means to ensure that the chain of command \nestablished by the Appointments Clause is observed. \nArthrex considered the officer status of inferior \nofficer administrative patent judges (\u201cAPJ\u201d) who \nmade binding decisions on patentability, but were \nremoval protected and could not have their decisions \nreviewed by a principal officer.  To determine the \nAPJs\u2019 officer status, the Court evaluated whether they \nwere sufficiently directed and supervised by a \nprincipal \nofficer \ngiven \nthe \nnature \nof \ntheir \nresponsibilities. The Court concluded that, in \nadjudications, \u201c[o]nly an officer properly appointed to \na principal office may issue a final decision binding \nthe Executive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 23.  Because no \nprincipal officer had the ability to review APJs\u2019 \ndecisions, the APJs were not sufficiently supervised \nby a principal officer given their responsibilities. This \nsame logic can be extended to all binding decisions \nmade by inferior officers for the Executive Branch, \nwhich \ncannot \nbe \ncountermanded \nwithout \nthe \navailability of principal officer review. \nPetitioners emphasize the importance of at-will \nremoval as a supervisory tool. But when binding \ndecisions are at issue, the ability of a principal officer \nto remove an inferior officer at will is insufficient \nsupervision without principal officer review.  While \nremoval is an essential tool to ensure the faithful \nexecution of the laws, it does not sufficiently preserve \nthe Appointments Clause\u2019s chain of command when \nbinding decisions are involved.  That is so because \nremoval does not permit a principal officer to reverse \na final, binding decision of an inferior officer; it only \nauthorizes the termination of that inferior officer after \nthe fact.  So, removal is ultimately ineffective at \nensuring that the binding decisions of the Executive \n\n \n4 \nBranch are subject to the political accountability the \nAppointments Clause requires.  Indeed, Arthrex \nrejected the elimination of a removal restriction as \nsufficient oversight for APJs, instead leaving the \nremoval protection in place and removing the \nrestriction on principal officer review.  \nAt issue here are the members of the U.S. \nPreventative Services Task Force who make final, \nbinding, decisions for the Executive Branch as to the \npreventative services that private health insurers \nmust cover.  But Task Force members are not \nappointed as principal officers.2  And Congress did not \nprovide a means for the Secretary to substantively \nreview the Task Force\u2019s decisions. Arthrex effectively \ndecides \nthat \nthis \narrangement \nviolates \nthe \nAppointments Clause.  Like the APJ decisions, Task \nForce decisions are binding on the Executive Branch \nand non-reviewable.  As such, Arthrex requires that \nthe official making these decisions be appointed as a \nprincipal officer.  Since they are not, the Task Force \nmembers are unconstitutionally appointed. The U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit should be \naffirmed on this point. \nShould the Court decide that Arthrex does not \napply beyond Executive Branch adjudications, it \nshould still take this opportunity to clarify that final, \nbinding decisions in Executive Branch adjudications \nmust be made by a principal officer or subject to \nprincipal \nofficer \nreview. \n \nIn \npost-Arthrex \nAppointments Clause challenges to administrative \nadjudications, lower courts have cabined Arthrex to its \nfacts and relied on Edmond\u2019s consideration of removal \n \n2 Amicus does not take a position on whether Task Force \nmembers were properly appointed as inferior officers. \n\n \n5 \nand administrative oversight to uphold adjudication \nschemes that lack the dispositive requirement of \nprincipal officer review.  Lower courts\u2019 evasion of \nArthrex in adjudication cases should not be allowed to \ncontinue. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nDecisions binding the Executive Branch \nmust be made by a principal officer \nA. The Appointments Clause establishes a \nchain of command for Executive Branch \nofficers \nThe Appointments Clause\u200a sets out the means of \nappointment for Officers of the United States and in \ndoing so establishes a two-tiered chain of command. \nThe President is authorized to appoint \u201cOfficers of the \nUnited States\u201d with the \u201cAdvice and Consent of the \nSenate\u201d.  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  This is the \nexclusive method of appointment for principal \nofficers\u2014officers who wield substantial executive \npower with no superior other than the President\u2014and \nthe default method of appointment for all officers.  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 12.  The Appointments Clause \nprovides an alternative method of appointment for \ninferior officers\u2014less-powerful officers supervised by \nprincipal officers.  Id. at 12-13; Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997).  For inferior officers, \nCongress may \u201cvest the[ir] Appointment\u201d \u201cin the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads \nof Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. \nThe \u201cclear and effective chain of command\u201d \nestablished by the Appointments Clause provides \nlegitimacy to the exercise of Executive Power and \nensures \u201caccountability to the public.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 \n\n \n6 \nU.S. \nat \n11 \n(citation \nomitted). \n \nLegitimacy, \naccountability, and quality are all essential for the \nexercise of the significant authority for which all \nofficers are responsible.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 11-\n12. \nFor the chain of command to be maintained \u201cthe \nnature of [an officer\u2019s] responsibilities\u201d must be \n\u201cconsistent with [his] method of appointment.\u201d \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  To evaluate this consistency, \nthe \nCourt \nconsiders \nan \nofficer\u2019s \nmethod \nof \nappointment with his functions and with the \nsupervision over him by other officers.  See, e.g., id. at \n13-18.  \u201cAn inferior officer must be \u2018directed and \nsupervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 13. (quoting \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 663).  The requisite level of \nsupervision for an inferior officer is determined by the \ntype of responsibilities the officer carries out.  Ibid. \nB. Binding \ndecisions \nfor \nthe \nExecutive \nBranch made by inferior officers must be \nsubject to principal officer review \nThe officer-level function at issue in this case is \nthe issuance of decisions that bind the Executive \nBranch.  This type of decision was recently addressed \nin Arthrex in the context of Executive Branch \nadjudications. \n \nArthrex \nconcluded \nthat, \nin \nadjudications, \u201c[o]nly an officer properly appointed to \na principal office may issue a final decision binding \nthe Executive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 23.  The logic of \nArthrex extends to all binding decisions of the \nExecutive Branch, making Arthrex the relevant rubric \nfor evaluating the sufficiency of supervision for any \nofficer making such decisions.   \n\n \n7 \nArthrex considered the officer status of APJs in \nthe Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d).  Id. at 8.  \nAPJs were PTO adjudicators appointed as inferior \nofficers by the Secretary of Commerce and authorized \nto issue final, binding decisions for the Executive \nBranch in adversarial inter partes patent review \nproceedings.  Id. at 8-9.  APJs could only be removed \nfor cause.  Id. at 17.  And the PTO Director was \nstatutorily prohibited from reviewing the APJs\u2019 \npatentability decisions.  Id. at 14.  The question before \nthe Court was whether the APJs were sufficiently \nsupervised by the principal officer PTO Director to \nmake binding decisions on patent validity as inferior \nofficers.  Id. at 14-15.   \nTo analyze this question, the Court turned to \nEdmond, the source of the direction-and-supervision \ntest for determining whether an officer was a principal \nor inferior officer.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  Edmond \nconsidered the inferior officer status of Coast Guard \nCourt of Criminal Appeals judges by reviewing \nwhether:  (1) the judges were subject to procedural \nrules or other administrative oversight mechanisms \ncontrolled by a superior officer, (2) the judges were \nremovable at will, and (3) the judges\u2019 decisions were \nreviewed by a superior officer such that they could not \n\u201crender a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d  \n520 U.S. at 664-65.   \nAccording to the Court, the Court of Criminal \nAppeals judges were administratively overseen and \nremovable \u201cwithout cause\u201d by the Judge Advocate \nGeneral, and certain of their decisions were reviewed \nby the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which \nwas composed of principal officers.  Ibid.  This \narrangement provided sufficient supervision for the \n\n \n8 \njudges to be constitutionally appointed as inferior \nofficers.  Id. at 666.  Among the three considerations, \n\u201c[w]hat [was] significant\u201d for inferior officer status \nwas that the judges\u2019 decisions were reviewable by a \nprincipal officer.  Id. at 665. \nIn \nArthrex, \nthe \nCourt \napplied \nEdmond\u2019s \nconclusion that principal officer review was the \nparamount factor for determining inferior officer \nstatus, and made it a necessity for Executive Branch \nadjudications.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14-18.  Arthrex \nsingled out the availability of principal officer review \nfor the judges in Edmond as the key difference with \nthe APJs, noting that for APJs this \u201c\u2018significant\u2019\u201d \nfactor was \u201cabsent.\u201d  Id. at 14.  Therefore, because the \nAPJs\u2019 decisions were not reviewable by the PTO \nDirector, \nthe \nCourt \nheld \nthat \ntheir \nfinal \ndecisionmaking authority was inconsistent with their \nappointment as inferior officers. Id. at 14-15, 23.  \nThe logic of Arthrex extends beyond inter partes \nreview adjudications to all officers and government \nemployees functioning as officers who make final, \nbinding, and unreviewable decisions for the Executive \nBranch.3  After all, the key feature of adjudicative \ndecisions that drove the outcome in Arthrex\u2014their \nbinding nature on the Executive Branch\u2014is not \nlimited \nto \nadjudications. \n \nLegislative \nrules \npromulgated through the Administrative Procedure \nAct\u2019s \nnotice-and-comment \nrulemaking \nprocess \n \n3 Arthrex declined to establish an \u201c\u2018exclusive criterion\u2019 for \ndistinguishing between principal and inferior officers\u201d when \nevaluating officers \u201coutside the context of adjudication\u201d where \n\u201cdecisions by inferior officers do not bind the Executive Branch \nto exercise power in a particular manner.\u201d  Id. at 23 (emphasis \nadded). \n\n \n9 \nproduce rules that have the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d  \nPerez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) \n(citation omitted).  And the Executive Branch is bound \nby such rules, the same as the regulated party, until \nthe agency changes the rules through another round \nof notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See id. at 95.  The \nbinding effect of these non-adjudicative final decisions \nof the Executive Branch similarly necessitates they be \nmade by a principal officer.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n23.  \nThe historical analysis in Arthrex confirms that its \nlogic extends beyond adjudications.  In 1792, \nAlexander Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, \nannounced the necessity of the principal officer\u200a\u2019s \n\u201cright to judge and direct\u201d\u2014in this case the customs \nofficials executing his instructions\u2014to \u201censur[e] that \n\u2018the responsibility for a wrong construction rests with \nthe head of the department, when it proceeds from \nhim.\u2019\u201d  594 U.S. at 18-19.  Additionally, an \u201c[e]arly \ncongressional statute[]\u201d subjected the issuance of \nliquor licenses \u201c\u2018to the superintendence, control and \ndirection of the department of the treasury\u2019\u201d thereby \n\u201cempower[ing a] department head[] to supervise the \nwork of [his] subordinates.\u201d  Id. at 19 (citation \nomitted).  Both examples reflect an early focus on \nprincipal officer control of decisionmaking beyond \nadjudications.  \nC. Removal is insufficient supervision for an \ninferior officer who makes final, binding, \nand unreviewable decisions \nPetitioners emphasize at-will removal as the \n\u201cmost potent\u201d supervision mechanism for inferior \nofficers.  Pet. Br. at 20.  But while important, at-will \nremoval cannot replace principal officer review as a \n\n \n10 \nnecessary supervisory tool for an inferior officer to \nissue binding decisions.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 26 \n(Roberts, C.J., plurality opinion).  Principal officer \nreview ensures that the \u201cchain of command\u201d \nestablished by the Appointments Clause in these \ncircumstances is maintained by providing the \nprincipal officer a \u201cmeans of countermanding\u201d an \ninferior officer\u200a\u2019s decision.  Id. at 16, 18.  In contrast, \nremoval is a blunt instrument that can only be used \nafter the fact without effect on the inferior officer\u200a\u2019s \ndecisions.  See id. at 16-17. \nThis Court has consistently reasoned that \nremoval does not provide sufficient supervision for an \ninferior officer to make binding decisions without \nreview by a principal officer.  Edmond itself \n\u201crecognized\u201d removal as \u201ca powerful tool for control\u201d \nover the inferior officer judges.  520 U.S. at 664.  But \nthe Court acknowledged that this control was \u201cnot \ncomplete.\u201d  Ibid.  The Judge Advocated General with \nat-will removal power was prohibited from influencing \nthe judges\u2019 decisions through threats of removal and \n\u201cha[d] no power to reverse decisions of the court.\u201d  \nIbid.  So, Edmond went on to evaluate whether there \nwas a principal officer who had review authority.  Id. \nat 664-65. Only after the Court determined there was \ndid it conclude that the judges were properly \nappointed as inferior officers. Id. at 665-66. \nFree Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, \n485, 510 (2010), reapplied the relevance of principal \nofficer review to the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board that issued rules and conducted its \nown disciplinary proceedings.  There, the Court had \n\u201cno hesitation in concluding that under Edmond the \nBoard members [were] inferior officers\u201d based on the \nability of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n\n \n11 \n(i.e., principal officers) to remove them at will and \n\u201cgiven the Commission\u200a\u2019s other oversight authority.\u201d  \n561 U.S. at 510 (emphasis added).  That other \nauthority included the ability of the Commission to \napprove or alter the rules issued by and the sanctions \nimposed by the Board\u2014in other words, principal \nofficer review.  Id. at 486, 504. \nArthrex continued this line of precedent. In \nholding that the APJs were functioning without a \nproper \nappointment, \nthe \nCourt \nrepeatedly \nemphasized that the primary consideration for \ninferior officer status was whether they could issue \nbinding decisions without review by anyone in the \nExecutive Branch.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14; id. at 17 \n(APJ power \u201cconflicts with the design of the \nAppointments Clause\u201d because of \u201cthe insulation of \n[their] decisions from any executive review\u201d); id. at 23 \n(\u201c[T]he unreviewable authority wielded by APJs . . . is \nincompatible with their appointment by the Secretary \nto an inferior office.\u201d); id. at 27 (Roberts, C.J., plurality \nopinion) (\u201cThe Constitution [] forbids the enforcement \nof statutory restrictions on the Director that insulate \nthe decisions of APJs from his direction and \nsupervision.\u201d).  \nThe Court\u2019s remedy in Arthrex confirmed the \nnecessity of principal officer review for binding \ndecisions.  While below, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit decided to eliminate the removal \nrestriction on APJs, this Court disagreed and instead \neliminated the statutory restriction on principal \nofficer review.  Id. at 24-26 (Roberts, C.J., plurality \nopinion).  It adopted this remedy because \u201creview by \nthe \nDirector \nbetter \nreflects \nthe \nstructure \nof \nsupervision within the PTO and the nature of APJs\u2019 \nduties.\u201d  Id. at 26; see also id. at 27 (\u201c[T]he source of \n\n \n12 \nthe constitutional violation is the restraint on the \nreview authority of the Director.\u201d).  Notably, the Court \nleft the APJs\u2019 removal restriction in place.  Id. at 26.  \nThree of the dissenting Justices concurred in this \nremedy, agreeing with the majority that the \n\u201cstatutory scheme is defective only because the APJ\u200a\u2019s \ndecisions are not reviewable by the Director alone.\u201d  \nId. at 44 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part).  This remedy is all but conclusive that, \nwithout \nprincipal \nofficer \nreview, \nremoval \nis \ninsufficient supervision for an inferior officer making \nbinding decisions. \nII. Task Force members function as principal \nofficers without a proper appointment \nAt issue here is the application of Arthrex to the \nmembers of the Task Force.  The Task Force is nested \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services \nas part of the Public Health Service\u2019s Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (\u201cAHRQ\u201d).  Pet. Br. \nat 5.  The Task Force is \u201cconvene[d]\u201d by the Director \nof AHRQ, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1), who is appointed \nby the Secretary, id. \u00a7 299(a).  There is no statutory \nrestriction on members\u2019 removal.  See id. \u00a7 299b-4(a). \nThe Task Force is responsible for developing \nrecommendations for \u201cbest practice\u201d in clinical \npreventative services based on the \u201ceffectiveness, \nappropriateness, and cost-effectiveness\u201d of such \nservices.  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  These recommendations \nare \u201cpublished in the Guide to Clinical Preventative \nServices.\u201d  Ibid.  Congress also required that the Task \nForce members and their recommendations \u201cbe \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not subject \nto political pressure.  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n\n \n13 \nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Affordable Care \nAct, which established for health insurers minimum \ncoverage requirements for preventative services.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13.  Among the services health \ninsurers were required to cover were those given \u201ca \nrating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019\u201d by the Task Force, making Task \nForce recommendations binding decisions of the \nExecutive Branch for purposes of the coverage \nrequirement.  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  Congress also \nempowered the States to impose these coverage \nrequirements on health insurers and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to impose civil money \npenalties on plans that fail to meet them.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-22.  The Task Force recommendations are the \nlaw health insurers must follow and the Executive \nBranch must enforce until the Task Force undertakes \nanother review to update its recommendations.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2).  Congress granted the \nSecretary only a limited role in these decisions to \n\u201cestablish a minimal interval\u201d between the date of the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendation and its effective date for \nthe coverage mandate.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). \nThis arrangement violates the Appointments \nClause because Task Force members are making \nbinding decisions for the Executive Branch with \nneither a principal officer appointment nor the \navailability of principal officer review. See Arthrex, \n594 U.S. at 23. It is indisputable that Task Force \nmembers are not \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

For these \nconditions, early detection and preventive services, \nincluding those recommended by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force (\u201cUSPSTF\u201d or \u201cTask Force\u201d), are \ncritical.  Further, removal of financial barriers for such \npreventive services pursuant to the preventive care \nmandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct (\u201cACA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13, is one of the most \neffective tools amici have to ensure the health and well-\nbeing of their communities.  Amici write to explain the \nlegal errors of the lower court\u2019s decision and to provide \nunique insights, based on their direct experience \nworking \nwith \ndisproportionately \nvulnerable \ncommunities, how the outcome of this case will impact \naccess to critical preventive services such as diabetes \nscreening, cancer prevention measures, and numerous \nother preventive interventions recommended by the \nUSPSTF. \nThe Center for HIV Law and Policy (\u201cCHLP\u201d) is a \nnational, abolitionist legal and policy organization \nfighting to end stigma, discrimination, and violence \n \n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for amici curiae state that no \ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no \nperson or entity other than amici or their counsel has made a \nmonetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this \nbrief.  \n\n2 \n \nagainst people living with and vulnerable to human \nimmunodeficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d) and other stigmatized \nhealth conditions.

CHLP operates within and \naround criminal, legal, and public health systems at the \nstate and federal levels to craft policies that amplify the \npower of mobilizations for systemic change guided by \nracial, gender, and economic justice.  CHLP collaborates \nwith people living with HIV, organizers and base \nbuilders, \ndirect \nservice \nproviders, \nand \nnational \norganizations to identify, create, and share expertly \ncrafted, intersectional legal and policy resources and \nadvocacy strategies.  \nThe Afiya Center is a reproductive justice \norganization centered on transforming the lives of Black \nwomen and girls in Texas.  This case directly impacts \nAfiya Center\u2019s mission to advocate for comprehensive \nhealthcare access for Black communities in Texas, \nparticularly those affected by HIV.  The Afiya Center \nserves as a crucial support system for Black Texans \nliving with HIV, many of whom rely on preventive care \nservices mandated by the ACA.  The potential \nelimination of the requirement that health plans cover \npre-exposure prophylaxis (\u201cPrEP\u201d) medications without \ncost-sharing would have devastating consequences for \nthe community the Afiya Center serves.  Texas already \nfaces significant disparities in HIV prevention and \ntreatment, with Black individuals accounting for a \ndisproportionate number of new HIV diagnoses in the \nstate. \n\n3 \n \nWomen With A Vision (\u201cWWAV\u201d) is a Louisiana-\nbased organization working to improve the lives of \nmarginalized women, their families, and communities by \naddressing the social conditions that hinder their health \nand well-being.  WWAV accomplishes this through \nrelentless advocacy, health education, supportive \nservices, and community-based participatory research.  \nWWAV was founded in direct response to the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic, to ensure that its communities \nreceived the resources necessary to prevent the \ntransmission of HIV.

Central to its \nwork is ensuring access to lifesaving HIV prevention \ntools, particularly PrEP.  The USPSTF awarded PrEP \nan \u201cA\u201d rating based on its proven efficacy in preventing \nHIV transmission.

Under the ACA, \nCongress requires health insurance issuers and health \nplans to cover certain preventive services recommended \nby the Task Force without imposing any cost-sharing \nrequirements on patients.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision would jeopardize the ACA\u2019s \nguarantee of cost-free coverage for the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommended services\u2014a measure that ensures more \nthan 150 million Americans\u2019 access to life-saving \nhealthcare.   \nAmici submit that Congress\u2019s choice to empower the \nTask Force should be upheld.  The Task Force sits \nwithin the Public Health Service, over which the HHS \nSecretary exercises supervisory authority.  Moreover, \nthe HHS Secretary may remove Task Force members at \nwill, and these members have a limited mandate: issue \n \n20 Examining the United States Preventive Task Force, supra note \n3, at 14; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). \n\n10 \n \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nconcerning \npreventive health services.   \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, the Task \nForce\u2019s structure does not violate the Appointments \nClause of the Constitution, art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  Task Force \nmembers are removable at will, are supervised by \nsuperiors, and have narrow jurisdiction, limited duties, \nand limited tenure.  Under this Court\u2019s precedents, Task \nForce members are inferior officers who are subordinate \nto the HHS Secretary.  Upending the scheme that \nCongress \ncrafted \nwould \nhave \nsevere \npractical \nconsequences for millions of Americans who benefit from \nno-cost preventive services based on the Task Force\u2019s \nrecommendations.   \nFurther, amici write to emphasize the importance of \nTask Force recommendations and no-cost preventive \ncare on public health in America.  No-cost preventive \ncare reduces the incidence of many diseases and other \nhealth conditions\u2014from cardiovascular disease to \ndiabetes to HIV\u2014thereby improving quality of life and \nreducing premature death.  For example, one study \nestimates that if allowed to stand, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nruling in the first year alone \u201cwill result in more than \n2000 entirely preventable primary HIV infections \u2026 and \nmany more infections in other populations at high risk of \nHIV transmission.\u201d21  For the communities that amici \n \n21 A.

II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  The clause limits the \nexercise of certain kinds of governmental power to those \npersons appointed pursuant to the special procedures \nprovided for officers.  See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, \n125-26 (1976) (per curiam), superseded by statute as \nstated in McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, 540 U.S. \n93 (2003); OLC Opinion, Officers of the United States \nWithin the Meaning of the Appointments Clause (Apr. \n16, 2007). \nFor purposes of appointment, the Constitution \n\u201cdivides all its officers into two classes.\u201d  Morrison v. \nOlson, 487 U.S. 654, 670 (1988) (quoting United States v. \n\n12 \n \nGermaine, 99 U.S. 508, 509 (1878)).  \u201c[P]rincipal officers \nare selected by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.\u201d  Id.  While \u201c[g]enerally speaking, \nthe term \u2018inferior officer\u2019 connotes a relationship with \nsome higher ranking officer or officers below the \nPresident,\u201d \u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer \ndepends on whether he has a superior.\u201d  Edmond v. \nUnited States, 520 U.S. 651, 662 (1997).  Thus, \u201cinferior \nofficers\u201d are \u201cofficers whose work is directed and \nsupervised at some level by others who were appointed \nby Presidential nomination with the advice and consent \nof the Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663. \nThe Clause therefore establishes two tiers of \nofficers\u2014principal and inferior\u2014and provides different \nappointment processes for each.  As this Court has \nrepeatedly held, the Clause\u2019s delineation of principal and \ninferior officers is \u201camong the significant structural \nsafeguards of the constitutional scheme\u201d and is \n\u201cdesigned to preserve political accountability relative to \nimportant Government assignments.\u201d  Id. at 659, 663.  \nThough this Court has not \u201cset forth an exclusive \ncriterion for distinguishing between principal and \ninferior officers,\u201d id. at 661, its precedents set forth \n\u201cseveral factors\u201d that guide its analysis, including \nwhether the officer: (1) \u201cwas subject to removal by a \nhigher officer,\u201d (2) only performed \u201climited duties,\u201d (3) \nhas limited jurisdiction, and (4) limited tenure.  Id. \nIndeed, looking to these factors, this Court has held that \nthe independent counsel created by provisions of the \nEthics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 591-599, \nwas an inferior officer, Morrison, 487 U.S. at 695-97; that \njudges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals \n\n13 \n \nwere inferior officers, Edmond, 520 U.S. at 661; and that \nmembers of the Public Company Accounting Oversight \nBoard were inferior officers, Free Enterprise Fund v. \nPublic Co. Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, \n510 (2010).   \nHere, all four factors are met, confirming that the \nTask Force members are inferior officers for purposes of \nthe Appointments Clause.   \nA. The Task Force Members are Removable at \nWill and Subject to the HHS Secretary\u2019s Direct \nSupervision. \nThis Court\u2019s cases have recognized that the key \nthreshold question in determining whether an officer is \ninferior is whether the officer is removable at will.  In \nEdmond, this Court held that judges of the Coast Guard \nCourt of Criminal Appeals were inferior officers in part \nbecause they could be removed by the Judge Advocate \nGeneral \u201cwithout cause.\u201d 520 U.S. at 664.  This Court \nnoted that \u201c[t]he power to remove officers\u201d at will and \nwithout cause \u201cis a powerful tool for control\u201d of an \ninferior.  Id.; see also Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 537 F.3d 667, 707 (D.C. Cir. 2008) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201cEdmond was a \nrelatively easy case\u201d because \u201c[t]he officers were \nremovable at will\u201d), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, and \nremanded 561 U.S. 477 (2010).   \nIn Free Enterprise Fund, then-Judge Kavanaugh \nreasoned that \u201c[r]emovability at will carries with it the \ninherent power to direct and supervise,\u201d which connotes \nan officer\u2019s inferiority for purposes of the Appointments \nClause.  537 F.3d at 707.  In holding that members of the \n\n14 \n \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board were \ninferior officers, this Court relied heavily on the fact that \nthe \u201cstatutory restrictions on the Commission\u2019s power \nto remove Board members\u201d was \u201cunconstitutional and \nvoid,\u201d without which the Commission could \u201cremove \nBoard members at will.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund, 561 \nU.S. at 510.  Likewise, Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent in \nMorrison reasoned that if the independent counsel there \nhad been \u201cremovable at will by the Attorney General, \nthen she would [have been] subordinate to him and thus \nproperly designated as inferior.\u201d  487 U.S. at 716 (Scalia, \nJ., dissenting).   \nThe rule that emerges from this Court\u2019s precedents \ndictates that \u201cthe term \u2018inferior officer\u2019 connotes a \nrelationship with some higher-ranking officer or officers \nbelow the President.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662.  In \nother words, \u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer \ndepends on whether he has a superior.\u201d  Id.  Moreover, \nthis Court has repeatedly held that at-will removal is the \nsine qua non of inferior officer status.   \nApplying that framework here, Task Force members \nare inferior officers.  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged \nthat an \u201cofficer\u2019s removability\u201d is the \u201cmost important\u201d \n\u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  That factor is \nmet here.  As the Fifth Circuit acknowledged, \u201cthe HHS \nSecretary may remove members of the Task Force at \nwill.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a-19a (reasoning that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 229b-4(a)(6) cannot be construed to \u201cinhibit the HHS \nSecretary from removing the Task Force members at \nhis will\u201d); cf. Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 248 (2021) \n(\u201cWhen a statute does not limit the President\u2019s power to \nremove an agency head, we generally presume that the \n\n15 \n \nofficer serves at the President\u2019s pleasure.\u201d).  Moreover, \nas the Government emphasizes in its brief, the HHS \nSecretary has direct supervisory authority over the \nTask Force and can deny binding effect to their \npreventive services recommendations.  See Pet\u2019r Br. 26-\n30.  \nIn sum, that the HHS Secretary has the power to \n\u201ccontrol\u201d \nTask \nForce \nmembers \n\u201cby \nremoval\u201d \n\u201cestablishe[d] that the [members] here have the \nnecessary superior.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 667 (Souter, \nJ., concurring in part). \nB. The Other Three Factors Are Also Met. \nThis Court considers three other factors when \ndetermining whether an officer is inferior under the \nAppointments Clause. The Fifth Circuit overlooks these \nfactors, which are relevant indicia of inferiority.  The \nCourt in Edmond recognized that its prior cases did \u201cnot \nset forth an exclusive criterion for distinguishing \nbetween principal and inferior officers,\u201d but that its \ndecision in Morrison was guided by \u201cseveral factors: \nthat the [officer] was subject to removal by a higher \nofficer . . . that she performed only limited duties, that \nher jurisdiction was narrow, and that her tenure was \nlimited,\u201d 520 U.S. at 661 (citing Morrison, 487 U.S. at \n671-72).   \nAs discussed supra, the Task Force members are \nremovable at-will and supervised by the HHS \nSecretary.  The other three factors\u2014limited duties, \nnarrow jurisdiction, and limited tenure\u2014are also \nsatisfied.  We begin with narrow jurisdiction. \n \n\n16 \n \n1. \nNarrow Jurisdiction. \nThe Task Force has narrow jurisdiction.  Its \nmembers make recommendations regarding specific \ntypes of care for a specific subset of the healthcare \ncommunity subject to review of a specific set of clinical \npreventive best practice recommendations.  Its \n\u201crecommendations,\u201d plainly read, are mere suggestions \nor proposals for actions authorized to be taken only by \nthe HHS Secretary.  Finally, the Task Force has no \nauthority whatsoever to enforce its recommendations.  \nThat authority lies instead with the 50 states and the \nHHS Secretary. \nWhen deciding if an officer is inferior, the Court \nexamines whether an officer is \u201climited in jurisdiction.\u201d  \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 661.  In Edmond, this Court \nconcluded that the military judges at issue were not \n\u2018\u201climited in jurisdiction,\u2019 as used in Morrison to refer to \nthe fact that an independent counsel may investigate \nand prosecute only those individuals, and for only those \ncrimes, that are within the scope of jurisdiction granted \nby the special three judge appointing panel.\u201d  Id.  In \nMorrison, the Court concluded that \u201cthe Act itself [was] \nrestricted in applicability to certain federal officials \nsuspected of certain serious federal crimes,\u201d and \u201cc[ould] \nonly act within the scope of the jurisdiction\u201d granted by \n\u201cthe Special Division [of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit] pursuant to a request \nby the Attorney General.\u201d  487 U.S. at 672.  There, Title \nVI of the Ethics in Government Act granted the \nindependent counsel, (once requested by the Attorney \nGeneral and appointed by the Special Division), \u201cfull \npower and independent authority to exercise all \n\n17 \n \ninvestigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of \nthe Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and \nany other officer or employee of the Department of \nJustice\u201d\u2014with a minor exception for matters requiring \n\u201cpersonal action\u201d by the Attorney General alone.  Id. at \n660-63, 663 n.6 (emphasis added).  The scope of such \njurisdiction, upon consideration of the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s request, was specifically defined by the \nSpecial Division.  Id. at 661. \nLikewise, the Task Force is limited in jurisdiction.  \nFirst, Task Force members are limited in that they make \n\u201crecommendations\u201d for a specific type of care for a \nspecific subset of the healthcare community.  Initially \n\u201cconvene[d]\u201d only by the AHRQ Director, the Task \nForce \n\u201cshall \nreview\u201d \n\u201cscientific \nevidence\u201d \nand \n\u201cdevelop[]\u201d and \u201cupdat[e]\u201d \u201cprevious clinical preventive \nrecommendations\u201d \u201cfor the health care community.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  Upon being \u201cconvene[d]\u201d by the \nAHRQ Director, the ACA provides that the Task Force \nis \nrestricted \nto \nonly \n\u201cclinical \npreventive \nrecommendations,\u201d id. (emphasis added)\u2014as opposed to \na much broader range of care, which might include \ndiagnostic or therapeutic care for the management and \ntreatment of existing medical conditions.  Under Section \n299b-4(a)(1), \nthe \n\u201crecommendations\u201d \nare \nthen \n\u201cpublished in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services\u201d \nfor a specific group\u2014\u201cindividuals and organizations \ndelivering clinical services\u201d\u2014rather than a more \nexpansive group that might include pivotal non-clinical \nroles in the areas of hospital administration, research, \nand patient data management. \n\n18 \n \nSecond, the Act also limits the Task Force\u2019s scope of \nreview to a narrow set of \u201cclinical preventive best \npractice recommendations\u201d from specific groups, \nincluding \u201cfrom the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality,\u201d which retains authority to convene the \nTask Force. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  The relevant \nprovision provides that Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d \n\u201cshall consider clinical preventive best practice \nrecommendations from the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality, the National Institutes of Health, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nInstitute of Medicine, specialty medical associations, \npatient groups, and scientific societies.\u201d  Id. (emphasis \nadded).  Task Force recommendations, therefore, must \nconsider best practice recommendations from other \nfederal agencies such as the NIH and the CDC.22 \nFurther, the ACA requires the Task Force to make \n\u201crecommendations,\u201d which, plainly read, constrains its \nauthority.  A \u201crecommendation\u201d is defined as a \nsuggestion or proposal for a particular course of action.  \nKarsner v. Lothian, 532 F.3d 876, 886-87 (D.C. Cir. 2008) \n(\u201c\u2018Recommend\u2019 is defined as to suggest that (a particular \naction) should be done.\u201d (internal quotation marks and \n \n22 We briefly note that this provision also highlights the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s legally erroneous overreading of \u201cindependent and, to the \nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  Congress intended the Task Force to be independent \nonly insofar as its recommendations and free from political \ninfluence.  Mandating that the Task Force consider specific best \npractice recommendations from other federal agencies such as the \nNIH and the CDC, in addition to its members\u2019 removability at will \nand the direct supervision by the HHS Secretary, demonstrates \nthat the Task Force\u2019s role is quite constrained in scope. \n\n19 \n \ncitation omitted)); Utility Audit, Inc. v. Horace Mann \nServ. Corp., 383 F.3d 683, 687 (7th Cir. 2004) \n(\u201c\u2018[R]ecommendation\u2019 is defined as a suggestion that \nsomething is good or suitable for a particular job, while \n\u2018recommend\u2019 is defined as to suggest that (a particular \naction) should be done.\u201d (cleaned up)).  As the \nGovernment has explained, the HHS Secretary, and not \nthe Task Force, retains the sole authority to determine \nwhether and when certain recommendations become \nbinding on private parties.  Pet\u2019r Br. 26-30.  The Task \nForce, \ntherefore, \nmerely \nmakes \nsuggestions \nor \nproposals, while the HHS Secretary performs the \naffirmative action that gives the recommendations legal \neffect. \nThe use of \u201crecommendation\u201d elsewhere in the Act is \nconsistent with that interpretation.  Part B of \nSubchapter VII of the ACA, which amends the role of \nthe Task Force, further supports that the meaning of \n\u201crecommendation\u201d is a mere suggestion or proposal.  \nPart B mandates that the HHS Secretary act \u201cthrough \nthe \u2026 Task Force\u201d to \u201cconduct a series of studies \ndesigned to identify preventive interventions that can \nbe delivered in the primary care setting and that are \nmost valuable to older Americans.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4a(a).  It also stipulates that the HHS Secretary, once a \nyear, \u201cshall submit to Congress a report on the \nconclusions of the studies conducted . . . \u201ctogether with \nrecommendations \nfor \nsuch \nlegislation \nand \nadministrative actions as the Secretary considers \nappropriate.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4a(c) (emphasis added).  \nIn other words, as part of this annual report, the HHS \nSecretary, through the Task Force, provides its \n\n20 \n \nsuggestions or proposals to Congress about a separate \ncourse of action\u2014specifically \u201cfor such legislation and \nadministrative actions as the Secretary considers \nappropriate.\u201d  Id.  These \u201crecommendations\u201d further \nreflect Congress\u2019s intent that the Task Force\u2019s \njurisdiction be limited in scope. \nFinally, the Task Force has no investigative or \nprosecutorial authority to enforce its recommendations, \nwhich requires group health plans and individual health \nissuers to provide coverage with no cost-sharing for \ncertain \u201cevidence-based items or services\u201d in the Task \nForce\u2019s \u201ccurrent recommendations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13.  Enforcement authority for this provision, including \nthe potential imposition of civil penalties, lies with the \nstates and the HHS Secretary, not the Task Force.  42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-22(a)-(b) \n(explaining \nenforcement \nauthority of each state and the Secretary to enforce \nprovisions of Part A or Part D, including the imposition \nof penalties).  As argued by the Government, the Task \nForce also lacks the authority to determine whether and \nwhen their recommendations become binding.  Pet\u2019r Br. \n26-30.  Congress expressly placed that authority in the \nhands of the HHS Secretary.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b)(1) \n(\u201cThe Secretary shall establish a minimum interval \nbetween the date on which a recommendation . . . is \nissued and the plan year with respect to which the \nrequirement . . . is effective with respect to the service \ndescribed in such recommendation\u201d). \n2. \nCertain, Limited Duties. \nAs mentioned supra, the Task Force is authorized to \n\u201creview \nscientific \nevidence\u201d \nand \n\u201cdevelop[] \nrecommendations\u201d for specific types of care for specific \n\n21 \n \nindividuals and groups and, in doing so, must consider \nspecific best practice recommendations.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  The duties set forth in the ACA that \nfollow from this narrow jurisdiction are limited in scope. \nTo determine if an officer is inferior, the Court in \nEdmond wrote that it examined whether the officer had \n\u201cperformed only limited duties.\u201d  520 U.S. at 661.  In \nMorrison, the Court concluded that the independent \ncounsel had limited duties because her role, as compared \nto other prosecutors, was \u201crestricted primarily to \ninvestigation and, if appropriate, prosecution for certain \nfederal crimes.\u201d  487 U.S. at 671.  Though the statute \nthere delegated \u201cfull power and independent authority \nto exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions \nand powers of the Department of Justice,\u201d the Court \nemphasized that such authority \u201cdoes not include any \nauthority to formulate policy for the Government or the \nExecutive Branch, nor does it give [the independent \ncounsel] any administrative duties outside of those \nnecessary to operate her office.\u201d  Id. at 671-72 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  It further noted \nthat the statute \u201cspecifically provides that in policy \nmatters [the independent counsel] is to comply to the \nextent possible with the policies of the Department.\u201d  Id. \nat 672. \nTask Force duties align with the limited authority \nextended to its members.  For example, the statutory \nprovision establishing the Task Force requires that its \nduties \u201cshall include\u201d \u201cdevelopment of additional topic \nareas for new recommendations and interventions \nrelated to those topic areas,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2)(A), \nand \u201csubmission of yearly reports to Congress and \n\n22 \n \nrelated agencies identifying gaps in research, . . . and \nrecommending priority areas that deserve further \nexamination,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2)(F).  These duties \nare consistent with the limited jurisdiction of the Task \nForce to \u201cdevelop[]\u201d and \u201cupdat[e]\u201d \u201crecommendations\u201d \nregarding clinical preventive care.  \nFurthermore, the Task Force has a statutory duty to \ndevelop recommendations not unilaterally or arbitrarily, \nbut in coordination with the Federal Government\u2019s \nhealth policy and objectives, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2)(C) \n(duties \u201cshall include . . . improved integration with \nFederal Government health objectives and related \ntarget setting for health improvement\u201d), and by \n\u201ctak[ing] appropriate steps to coordinate its work with \nthe Community Preventive Services Task Force and the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(4).  And, as mentioned supra, the \nTask Force makes recommendations subject to specific \ntypes of care for specific subsets of the healthcare \ncommunity and must consider certain best practices \nrecommendations for clinical preventive care from other \nfederal entities such as the NIH and the CDC.  Thus, the \nTask Force \u201cdoes not [have] any authority to formulate \npolicy for the Government or the Executive Branch, nor \n. . . any administrative duties outside of those necessary \nto operate [its] office.\u201d  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 671-72. \n3. \nLimited Tenure. \nFinally, Task Force members are sufficiently limited \nin tenure.  They each serve a fixed four-year term and \nhave no ongoing duties beyond said term. The Task \nForce\u2019s tenure is even more limited than the \nindependent counsel in Morrison, who was statutorily \n\n23 \n \npermitted to serve under an indefinite term until the \nSpecial Division or the independent counsel herself \ndecided otherwise. \nAnother factor the Court has considered is whether \nan officer is \u201climited in tenure.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. at \n661.  In Morrison, the Court reasoned that there was \n\u201cconcededly no time limit on the appointment of a \nparticular [independent] counsel,\u201d but that the office \nwas nevertheless \u2018\u201ctemporary\u2019 in the sense that an \nindependent counsel is appointed essentially to \naccomplish a single task, and when that task is over the \noffice is terminated, either by the counsel herself or by \naction of the Special Division.\u201d  487 U.S. at 672.  \nThe independent counsel from Morrison had \u201cno \ntime limit on the appointment\u201d and was still deemed \n\u201climited in tenure.\u201d  Id.  However, Task Force members \nserve four-year terms, with annual turnover.  Moreover, \nTask Force members are removable at will, so their \nterms can be cut short at any time.  Neither \nRespondents nor the Fifth Circuit have pointed to \nanything in the ACA or any caselaw that would bar the \nHHS Secretary from removing a member of the Task \nForce before the end of their four-year term.  And there \nis no language in the ACA indicating that Task Force \nmembers maintain responsibilities beyond the end of \ntheir term.  In other words, Task Force members are \n\u201cappointed essentially to accomplish a single task, and \nwhen that task is over the office is terminated, . . . [with] \nno ongoing responsibilities that extend beyond the \naccomplishment of the mission . . . appointed for and \nauthorized by the [Act] to undertake.\u201d  Id.  \n\n24 \n \nTwo federal appellate decisions are persuasive on \nthis point.  Relying on Morrison, the Third Circuit has \nruled that Appeals Board members appointed by the \nHHS Secretary were inferior officers even where they \nserved \nterms \n\u201cnot \nrestricted \nin \nduration.\u201d  \nPennsylvania v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Hum. Servs., 80 \nF.3d 796, 803 (3d Cir. 1996).  Balancing the other factors, \nincluding that the HHS Secretary could \u201cremove a \nmember for cause or misconduct at any time\u201d and the \nAppeals Board\u2019s \u201cpowers and responsibilities [we]re \nlimited by regulation,\u201d the court found that the Board \nmembers were inferior officers.  Id. at 803-04.  The court \nspecifically rejected an argument that the Board \nmembers were principal officers because they \u201cwill \nserve indefinitely unless removed for misconduct.\u201d  Id. \nat 802.  And in Stanley v. Gonzales, a former federal \nbankruptcy trustee appointed by the Attorney General \nchallenged her subsequent removal as a violation of the \nAppointments Clause.  476 F.3d 653, 655 (9th Cir. 2007).  \nReasoning that her role was \u201climited geographically, \ntemporally, and topically\u201d and that she was \u201cinitially \nappointed to a five-year term,\u201d the Ninth Circuit ruled \nthat the Morrison factors meant that \u201c[i]f she was an \nofficer at all, she was most certainly an inferior officer.\u201d  \nId. at 659-60.  Here, Task Force members are removable \nat any time, are supervised by the HHS Secretary, and \nserve shorter terms than the officers deemed inferior in \nPennsylvania (indefinite) and Stanley (five years). \nIn sum, the three other factors relied upon to \ndetermine if an officer is inferior\u2014narrow jurisdiction, \nlimited duties, and limited tenure\u2014are satisfied and \ntherefore weigh in favor of concluding that Task Force \n\n25 \n \nmembers are inferior officers.  Accordingly, this Court \nshould reverse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s determination that \nTask Force members are not inferior officers.   \nII. \nThe Task Force Makes Critical, Evidence-\nBased Recommendations to Improve Health \nOutcomes Nationwide. \nCongress has ensured that the Task Force provides \nevidence-based recommendations that allow millions of \nAmericans to access critical preventive health care \nservices at no-cost.   \nA. The Task Force\u2019s Mandate Is Narrow, But \nCritical to Developing Objective and Evidence-\nBased \nPreventive \nCare \nServices \nRecommendations. \nCongress codified the Task Force by statute in the \nface of increasing \u201cpublic pressure to improve health \ncare quality\u201d in the United States.23  Escalating \ninstances of medical errors served as one cause of \n\u201cgrowing public concern,\u201d with a reputable study at the \ntime \u201cof more than 30,000 hospital patients in New York \nf[inding] that nearly 4[%] suffered serious injuries that \nwere related to the management of their illness rather \nthan the illness itself.\u201d24  Congress asked whether the \n \n23 Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Role in Health Care \nQuality Improvement: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Public \nHealth and Safety of the S. Comm. on Labor and Human \nResources, 105th Cong. 2 (1998) [hereinafter Hearing] (opening \nstatement of Sen. William H. Frist).  \n24 S. Rep. No. 106-82, at 12 (1999). \n\n26 \n \nFederal Government had \u201cthe ability \u2026 to make a \ndifference.\u201d25   \nCongressional hearings uncovered an overall \u201clack of \ninformation available to consumers. . . . to make \nappropriate choices\u201d about their care as one \u201cprimary\u201d \nbarrier to improved health care quality in the United \nStates.26  Despite the country\u2019s \u201cgrowing investment in \nbasic and biomedical research,\u201d Congress recognized \nthat any benefits would be forfeited if \u201cphysicians and \npatients [we]re unable to make the best use of the \nknowledge in everyday care.\u201d27  The answer: provide \n\u201cobjective, science-based information\u201d so that \u201cpatients \nand those who deliver care [have] the information they \nneed to make informed decisions regarding treatment \noptions.\u201d28  \nSet against this backdrop, it makes perfect sense that \nCongress structured the Task Force so that it could \nfocus on its limited mandate to develop objective, \nevidence-based recommendations on the effectiveness of \ndifferent preventive services.  It is further well within \nthe authority of Congress to ultimately determine that \nsuch research findings should be covered by insurers to \nencourage better preventive health outcomes for people \nacross the United States.  Cf. Mistretta v. United States, \n488 U.S. 361, 385 (1989) (\u201c[M]ere anomaly or innovation\u201d \n \n25 Hearing, supra note 23, at 2. \n26 S. Rep., supra note 24, at 9. \n27 Id. at 13. \n28 Id. at 12. \n\n27 \n \ndoes not violate the separation of powers).  This Court \nhas recognized that Congress has the authority to make \nthese judgments, and such judgments do not offend the \nPresident\u2019s removal power.  See, e.g., Morrison, 487 U.S. \nat 686 (reasoning that Congress could limit the \nPresident\u2019s power of removal through a for-cause \nprovision without offending the Constitution).  \nB. The Task Force\u2019s Recommendations Have Had \nan Immeasurable Impact on the Southern Black \nand Brown LGBTQ+ Communities Amici \nServe. \nAmericans have reaped the benefits of Congress\u2019s \ndecision to ensure that the Task Force\u2019s objective, \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \ninform \nwhich \npreventive services are covered by private insurers \nwithout cost-sharing.  People have increased access to \nlife-saving preventive care, and taxpayer dollars are not \nbeing spent to treat preventable conditions.29  Under the \ncurrent structure, the Task Force remains subject to the \nHHS Secretary\u2019s supervisory authority while properly \nfocused on developing recommendations that allow both \npatients and healthcare providers to better \u201cprevent \nunnecessary diseases and conditions, things like obesity \nand type 2 diabetes, heart disease, mental health \nconditions, and some forms of cancer.\u201d30  \n \n29 See generally Marquisha Jones & Jill Rosenthal, How the \nAffordable Care Act Improved Access to Preventive Health \nServices, \nCtr. \nfor \nAm. \nProgress \n(July \n10, \n2024), \nhttps://bit.ly/43h94ro. \n30 Prevention and Public Health: The Key to Transforming Our \nSickcare System: Hearing Before the S.

Historically and presently, Southerners face \ngreater risk of \u201ccertain chronic illnesses\u201d and are \ndisproportionately likely \u201cto experience worse health \noutcomes\u201d than the rest of the United States.31  Recent \nstudies have identified \u201ca high prevalence of chronic \ndisease\u201d in the South, recognizing that many such \nillnesses are leading causes of death nationwide despite \nbeing \u201cpreventable and treatable.\u201d32  Such illnesses \ninclude cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and, particularly \nfor Black and Brown Southerners, HIV.33   \n \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, 110th Cong. 2 (2008) (opening \nstatement of Senator Tom Harkin).   \n31 Samantha Artiga & Anthony Damico, Health and Health \nCoverage in the South: A Data Update, Kaiser Family Found., at 3 \n(Feb. 10, 2016), https://bit.ly/4gQkfdQ. \n32 Gabriel A.

To maintain a \nPrEP prescription, for example, patients not only have \nto secure medication, which, if uncovered, costs \nthousands of dollars per month, but also commit to \nperiodic doctor\u2019s visits and related preventive services \nincluding, among other things, HIV testing, STI \nscreening and counseling, and testing regarding their \n \nProphylaxis (PrEP) in Mississippi, 22 BMC Public Health 1604 \n(2022), https://bit.ly/4ieMXWP; see also Steven W.

Fairfax Dr., Suite 300 \nArlington, VA  22203 \n(202) 869-5210 \nPeggy.Little@NCLA.legal \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae \n \nMay 2, 2025 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS1 \n \nNCLA is a nonpartisan, nonprofit public-interest law firm. Professor Philip \nHamburger founded NCLA to challenge multiple constitutional defects in the \nmodern administrative state through original litigation, amicus curiae briefs, and \nother forms of advocacy. The \u201ccivil liberties\u201d of the organization\u2019s name include \nrights at least as old as the U.S. Constitution itself, such as jury trial, due process \nof law, and the right to be tried in front of impartial judges who provide their \nindependent judgments on the meaning of the law. Yet these selfsame civil rights \nare also very contemporary\u2014and in dire need of renewed vindication\u2014precisely \nbecause executive agencies and even the courts have neglected them for so long. \nNCLA aims to defend civil liberties\u2014primarily by asserting constitutional \nconstraints on the modern administrative state. Although Americans still enjoy \na shell of their Republic, a very different sort of government has developed within \nit\u2014a type, in fact, the Constitution was designed to prevent. This unconstitutional \nstate within the Constitution\u2019s United States is the focus of NCLA\u2019s concern. \nNCLA is particularly disturbed by the transformation of what was initially a \npurely advisory task force, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, into a \npowerful and wholly unaccountable \u201cagency\u201d unilaterally imposing mandatory \nmedical coverage obligations in the billions of dollars upon Americans and American \ninsurers. NCLA represents clients potentially affected by the new Question Presented \nand would have filed an amicus curiae brief at an earlier stage of these proceedings \nhad it been on notice that this question would be before the Court.  \nWhether these decisionmakers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d or \u201cinferior officers,\u201d \nCongress has not \u201cby Law\u201d vested the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services with authority to appoint them. Americans were thus wholly \nunrepresented in authorizing the appointments of the members of this task force who \nare accountable for the momentous and costly decisions by which they now bind \nmillions of Americans\u2014in violation of their core liberty of self-government. \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \n \n \nWhether Congress has \u201cby Law\u201d vested the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services with the authority to appoint members of the United \nStates Preventive Services Task Force. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. The briefs should \naddress this Court\u2019s decisions in United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385 (1868), and \nUnited States v. Smith, 124 U.S. 525 (1888). \n \n \n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored any part of this letter brief and no person or entity, other than NCLA \nand its counsel, paid for its preparation or submission.  Rule 37.6. All parties received advance notice \nof NCLA\u2019s intent to file this amicus letter brief. Rule 37.2(a). \n \n\n2 \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nTHE MAJOR UNBRIEFED IMPLICATIONS OF HARTWELL AND \nSMITH SHOULD BE FIRST ADDRESSED ON REMAND \n \nNeither Hartwell nor Smith was properly briefed or argued to this Court. In \nthis court, neither party even cited the cases in their opening briefs. Indeed, the \ngovernment raised Hartwell only on reply with respect to Petitioner\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d \nargument that even if \u201cthis Court concludes that Task Force members are \u2018inferior \nofficers,\u2019 Congress has not \u2018vested\u2019 the Secretary with power to appoint those \nmembers,\u201d an argument which the government concedes is distinct from the question \nof whether Task Force members are inferior officers. Pet. Rep. Br.16. The government \ncorrectly notes that the Fifth Circuit did not address that distinct issue, and this \nCourt did not grant certiorari on it. Pet. Rep. Br. 17. \n \nAlthough, according to the government, Hartwell supports its contention that \nCongress vested the Secretary with power to appoint Task Force members, that is a \nmisreading of the precedent. The government\u2019s tortuous argument goes like this: 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299(a)\u2019s provision \u201cthat \u2018[t]he Secretary shall carry out\u2019 the statutory \nprovisions governing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) by \n\u2018acting through the [AHRQ] Director,\u2019 who is himself appointed and removable at will \nby the Secretary,\u201d combined with the statutory provision \u201cthat \u2018[t]he Director shall \nconvene\u2019 the Task Force, which shall be \u2018composed of individuals of appropriate \nexpertise,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299(b)-4(a)(1),\u201d empowers \u201cthe Secretary to personally appoint \nTask Force members while acting through the AHRQ Director\u2014and at minimum, to \napprove (or reject) the Director\u2019s selections.\u201d Pet. Rep. Br. at 17. As made clear at oral \nargument, \u201cconvene\u201d is not a synonym for \u201cappoint.\u201d2 \n \nNeither statute provides for appointments of the Task Force members \u201cby \nLaw\u201d\u2014whether separately or combined. This loose daisy chain of appointments \npowers for other HHS subagencies cannot just casually loop in unnamed positions \nthat lack statutory appointment instructions. This is especially consequential when \npersons in what initially were \u201cadvisory\u201d roles have now assumed the constitutional \n\u201csignificant authority\u201d of \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, \n126 (1976) and unilaterally decide what preventive services must be covered by \ninsurers without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on patients. \n \nHartwell \n \nHartwell cannot carry the weight the government places on it, nor can Smith.  \nBoth cases involved embezzlement statutes that imposed penalties on specified \n \n2 See Justice Thomas at Tr. pp. 5-8, 34; Justice Gorsuch pp. 63-64.  \n\n3 \n \npersons entrusted with public monies\u2014so the Court in both cases had to strictly \nconstrue the statutes under the canon of lenity.  Mr. Hartwell, a clerk in the office of \nan assistant treasurer was convicted under an 1846 penalty statute that expressly \ndefined those persons \u201cintended to be brought within its scope\u201d to include 1) \u201cAll \nofficers and other persons charged by this act \u2026 with the safe-keeping of the public \nmoney\u201d 2) \u201cany officer or agent of the United States, and all persons participating in \nsuch act\u201d and 3) \u201call persons charged with the safe-keeping, transfer or disbursement \nof the public money.\u201d The Hartwell majority accordingly posed the question presented \nas: \u201cWas the defendant an \u201cofficer or person \u2018charged with the safekeeping of the \npublic money\u2019 within the meaning of the act?\u201d (emphasis in original). And it answered \nthe question by saying, \u201cWe think he was both.\u201d 73 U.S. 393. Accordingly, the case \nrested on two holdings, and whether Hartwell was an officer or not was not necessary \nto the Court\u2019s decision that the embezzlement statute applied to him. \n \nWhile it is true that the majority also proceeded to find that that this clerk was \nan \u201cofficer\u201d because he was appointed by the assistant treasurer \u201cwith the \napprobation of the Secretary of the Treasury,\u201d it relied upon a specific provision in \nthe General Appropriation Act of July 23, 1866 to find that he was an officer. That \nprovision was cited as 14 Stat. at Large, 200 but actually appears at 14 Stat. at Large \n202. (Appended at Ex. A). It provided an appropriation \u201c[f]or salaries of the clerks \u2026 \nin the office of assistant treasurer at Boston\u201d and, among other things, \u201cauthorized\u201d \nthe assistant treasurer \u201cto appoint, with the approbation of the Secretary of the \nTreasury \u2026 one chief clerk\u201d and 15 additional clerks, at 8 different salary levels \nranging from $3000/year to $800/year, one porter at $700/year and a watchman at \n$600/year. In a single sentence, Hartwell held this \u201capprobation\u201d by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury sufficient to satisfy the Appointments Clause, thus elevating these 18 \nemployees to the status of \u201cofficers of the United States.\u201d \n \nThree justices dissented, finding that Mr. Hartwell could not, by order of the \nassistant treasurer by whom he was appointed, \u201cbe placed \u2026 [under a duty] imposed \non him by some act of Congress.\u201d The dissent specifically objected to the holding that \nhe was an \u201cofficer,\u201d pointing out that under the 1846 statute he was appointed by the \nassistant treasurer alone, and that \u201cby an act passed long since [in 1866], and which \ncan have no effect on the construction of this one, the assent of the Secretary of the \nTreasury is required.\u201d The dissent viewed the penalties to apply \u201cexclusively to the \nlegal custodians of the public money and not to their clerks.\u201d \n \nFrom this, the government argues that \u201c[u]nder Hartwell, Congress properly \nvests the appointment power in a head of a department where, as here, it gives that \ndepartment head ultimate authority over the appointment\u2014even if a subordinate \nofficer also plays a role in the appointment process.\u201d Pet. Rep. Br. 17.\u201d The \ngovernment even cites Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477 at 512 n.13 (2010) \n(FEF) to say that this Court \u201cha[s] previously found that the department head\u2019s mere \n\n4 \n \napproval of a subordinate\u2019s appointment satisfies the Appointments Clause.\u201d Id. \n \nNot quite. The FEF Court in fact recites this proposition, but notes that these \nare \u201cprecedents that petitioners do not ask us to revisit.\u201d Id. This Court\u2019s order of \nApril 25 is precisely an invitation to revisit these holdings. \n \nSmith \n \nSmith is even less illuminating about the questions presented in this case. \nSmith, also an embezzlement case (Oh, those faithless 19th century clerks!), held that \na clerk in the office of the collector of the customs could not be charged under the \nstatutes of the United States that imposed penalties upon \u201cofficers\u201d: \n \nA clerk of the collector is not an \u201cofficer of the United States\u201d \u2026 . An \nofficer of the United States can only be appointed by the president, by \nand with the advice and consent of the senate, or by a court of law, or \nthe head of a department. A person in the service of the government who \ndoes not derive his position from one of these sources is not an officer of \nthe United States. 124 U.S. 525, 531-2. \n \nSmith distinguishes Hartwell by stating that Mr. Hartwell\u2019s appointment by the \nassistant treasurer \u201ccould only be made with the approbation of the secretary of the \ntreasury,\u201d 124 U.S. at 532, referring to that \u201capprobation\u201d as a \u201cfact\u201d which \u201cin the \nopinion of the [Hartwell] court rendered his appointment one by the head of the \ndepartment within the constitutional provision.\u201d The unanimous Smith decision also \ndistinguished Hartwell by noting that the Secretary [of the Treasury] \u201cis not invested \nwith the selection of the clerks of the collector [of customs]; nor is their selection in \nany way dependent upon his approbation.\u201d 124 U.S. at 533. \n \nAcknowledging that the indictment had averred that Mr. Smith\u2019s appointment \nhad such \u201capprobation,\u201d the court held that \u201cas no law required this approbation, the \naverment cannot exert any influence on the mind of the court.\u201d Id. Indeed, it held \nthat because the Constitution \u201cdeclares that \u2018the congress may by law vest the \nappointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in \nthe courts of law, or in the heads of departments[,]\u2019 [t]here must be, therefore, a law \nauthorizing the head of department to appoint clerks of the collector before his \napprobation of their appointment can be required.  No such law is in existence.\u201d  124 \nU.S. at 533. \n \nThe government has argued, despite Smith, that the same daisy chain of \n\u201cappointment by approbation\u201d applies to inspectors of the customs office. See Pet. \nRep. Br. 17-18 n. 1 (\u201cThat method of appointing inferior officers traces back to the \nFounding era. See Act of Mar. 2, 1799, ch. 22, \u00a7 21, 1 Stat. 642 (1799) (authorizing \n\n5 \n \ncustoms officers to appoint customs inspectors \u201cwith the approbation of the principal \nofficer of the treasury department)\u201d); 4 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 164 (1843) (concluding that \ncustoms inspectors were \u201cinferior officers\u201d whose appointment was vested in the \nTreasury Secretary\u201d)). But opinions of the Attorney General are not law.3 Moreover, \nSmith holds that a proper appointment requires a predicate law for the head of \ndepartment to appoint the official as well as a law providing for approbation of the \nsubordinate\u2019s appointment, both of which are missing here. \n \nBecause the majority\u2019s holding that Mr. Hartwell was an \u201cofficer\u201d was not \nnecessary to its decision\u2014he was liable whether an officer or a person\u2014Hartwell is \nan exceedingly slender reed upon which to erect the Task Force\u2019s legitimacy. The \ncontext of the cases matters, too. Neither Smith nor Hartwell involved questions of \nthe legitimacy of either clerk\u2019s appointment to exercise executive powers and \nauthority to influence the lives of Americans, but instead the more technical question \nof their personal exposure to criminal statutes. For this Court to render a decision \nthat relies on these out-of-context cases that antedate modern Appointments Clause \njurisprudence, and to do so as a matter of \u201cfirst view\u201d not final review, without a lower \ncourt record and consideration based upon robust briefing, would depart from settled \npractice and precedent of this court. The Supreme Court is \u201ca court of final review \nand not first view,\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.S. 103, 110 (2001), \nand ordinarily \u201cdo[es] not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.\u201d NCAA \nv. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470 (1999). To do so on this cursory record risks setting \nbinding precedent with unknown implications across the wide terrain of far-flung \nadministrative agencies and law. \n \nMoreover, this Court should revisit Hartwell in an appropriate, fully briefed \ncase because its alternate holding that mere \u201capprobation\u201d by a head of department \nsatisfies the Appointments Clause is both substantively and intuitively incorrect. On \nits facts, Hartwell\u2019s reading of an appropriations statute swept eight levels of Boston \nclerks, a porter and a watchman into the class of \u201cofficers of the United States,\u201d a \nstatus that might well have come as a surprise to the watchman and porter and some \nor all of the eight tiers of assistant and subordinate clerks. These counter-intuitive \npromotions, moreover, were not necessary to the holding and thus Hartwell\u2019s putative \nsignificance is both misleading and erroneous. \n \nThe government\u2019s deployment of this ancient, ill-considered, outlier case to \nlegitimize the far more shocking and consequential elevation of members of a \n \n3 See McElroy v. U.S. ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U.S. 281, 285-86 (1960) (an 1872 opinion of the Attorney \nGeneral is \u201centitled to some weight\u201d but such opinions \u201cdo not have the force of judicial decisions.\u201d);   \nLewis Pub. Co. v. Morgan, 229 U.S. 288, 311 (1913) (opinion of the Attorney General was not \u201cadequate \nto control or modify the conclusion we have reached as to the meaning of the provision.\u201d); Schick v. \nReed, 419 U.S. 256, 275 n.12 (1974) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u201cA legal opinion from the Attorney \nGeneral \u2026 hardly bears the force of law.\u201d). \n\n6 \n \nvolunteer advisory council into \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d through verbal \nlegerdemain where \u201capprobation\u201d equals \u201cappointment\u201d and \u201cconvene\u201d is good enough \nto mean both, eviscerates the whole purpose of the Appointments Clause by diluting \nthe accountability of heads of departments. These early cases predate the Court\u2019s \nmodern Appointments Clause formalism and are not invoked in such cases as Lucia \nv. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018) and Seila Law, LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020).  The \nAppointments Clause exists to ensure that the people are governed by officials who \nare answerable to the public. NFIB v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 126 (2022) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cThe question before us is not how to respond to the \npandemic, but who holds the power to do so. \u2026 [W]e do not impugn the intentions \nbehind the agency\u2019s mandate. Instead, we only discharge our duty to enforce the law\u2019s \ndemands when it comes to the question who may govern the lives of 84 million \nAmericans.\u201d). \n \nII. \nNO STATUTE VESTS AUTHORITY IN ANYONE TO APPOINT \nMEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE AS OFFICERS OF THE UNITED \nSTATES, EITHER \u201cPRINCIPAL\u201d OR \u201cINFERIOR\u201d \n \nSo, what do Hartwell and Smith teach us? That in the first instance, a statute \nproperly passed by Congress through bicameralism and presentment must first vest \nthe authority to appoint inferior officers of the United States in someone, whether a \nhead of department, a court of law, or the President. Inferior officers cannot just \nspring up as the transformed members of an advisory task force that later morph into \npersons holding constitutional status and authority\u2014without the Constitution\u2019s \nrequired appointments process being followed to ensure accountability. \n \nThis is not only NCLA\u2019s view of the principal teaching to be drawn from these \ncases, but also the conclusion of two scholars who recently published a thoughtful \nanalysis of this new aspect of the case sub judice. In their trenchant and timely \nassessment, Professors Josh Blackman and Seth Barrett Tillman challenge whether \nthe 1966 Reorganization Plan, cited by the government as ostensible statutory \nauthority for vesting powers in the Secretary of HHS to appoint Task Force members, \nis even a \u201claw\u201d at all.4 See U.S. v. Maurice. 26 F. Cas. 1211, 1214-15 (C.C. D. Va. 1823) \n(No. 15,747) (Marshall, C.J.). \n \nThe professors also reviewed the statutes the government cites and came away \nempty-handed on authority for members of the Task Force to operate as lawful \n\u201cofficers of the United States.\u201d Noting that \u201cthis litigation has focused closely on \nwhether the task force members are \u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers, Blackman and \n \n4 See Josh Blackman and Seth Barrett Tillman, The Supreme Court\u2019s Order for Supplemental Briefing \nin Kennedy v. Braidwood and the Reorganization Plan of 1966, THE VOLOKH CONSPIRACY, April 28, \n2025, available at http://bit.ly/3YruL52. \n\n7 \n \nTillman conclude that the request for supplemental briefing: \n \n\u201cshift[s] focus to whether any of the appointments of Task Force \nmembers \u2026 by the Secretary were supported by some statute. \nIndeed, the Court\u2019s focus on Hartwell and Smith may suggest the \nCourt believes only express statutory authority is permissible to \nvalidate an exercise of the appointment power by an inferior \nofficer. \n \n\u201cIf the positions of Task Force members are not filled consistent \nwith the Appointments Clause and Inferior Office Appointments \nClause, that is, if members are not appointed under the authority \nof a statute, then the purported officeholders are not officers of \nthe United States of any stripe, principal or inferior. At most, they \nwould be \u2018employees.\u2019 And, as a general matter, we do not think \nemployees can exercise the \u2018significant authority\u2019 of an officer of \nthe United States. \u2026 Such employees certainly cannot be vested \nwith any sort of \u2018independence\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis principal officers and the \nPresident. Here, and elsewhere, so much turns on whether a \nperson is or is not an officer of the United States.\u201d \n \nAccordingly, if the Court decides this issue on the merits without \nremand, it should hold that no statute vests authority in anyone to appoint \nmembers of the Task Force, much less in a head of department, the judiciary, \nor the President. Hence, the Task Force members lack constitutionally \nrequired appointments necessary to authorize their exercise of unilateral \n\u201csignificant authority\u201d to mandate preventive health care that must be covered \nby insurers without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on patients. \nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nPhilip Hamburger \nMark Chenoweth  \nMargaret A.

After the passage of the \nAffordable \nCare \nAct \n(\u201cACA\u201d), \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations became a critical first step in \nensuring effective interventions are covered by health \ninsurance. A wholesale invalidation of the coverage \nrequirement for Task Force\u2019s recommendations would \nstrike a critical, unnecessary and costly blow to the \nbattle to end HIV, hepatitis and other infectious \ndiseases. \nThis brief details the impact of HIV and \nhepatitis in the U.S., emphasizing that these are \ninfectious diseases spread by viruses which can and \nwill spread to any person unless prevented from doing \nso. Removing access to evidence-based preventive \nmeasures will have a devastating impact, not only on \nthose at risk for acquiring HIV and hepatitis, but also \nthe population at-large. \nWe then contend that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision relied on a fundamental misreading of the \nTask Force\u2019s enabling statute and a lack of \nunderstanding of how the executive branch has \nalready carried out its oversight function over the \nrecommendations of the Task Force. If properly \nunderstood, the Fifth Circuit could not have found \nthat the members of the Task Force were principal \nofficers in violation of the Appointments Clause. They \nare, in fact, inferior officers whose independence is \n\n4 \nsolely limited to the evidence-based process by which \nthey make their recommendations. For these reasons, \nwe urge this Court to reverse the lower court\u2019s \ndecisions \ninvalidating \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nHIV and Hepatitis Affect Millions of \nAmericans of All Demographics, and \nWeakening Bipartisan Efforts to End \nTheir Transmission Will Have \nCatastrophic Consequences. \nThe fight against HIV/AIDS is one of the most \nsignificant public health battles of the modern era. \nFor decades, false assumptions about how the virus \nspread and who was at risk impeded efforts to prevent \ntransmission and provide treatment. The devastating \ntoll of this delay is evident in the 700,000 American \nlives lost and the 1.2 million people still living with \nHIV.

These collective efforts have \nproduced scientific advancements in screening, \ntreatment and prevention of this disease and \nsimultaneously expanded access to the same.  \nThese \nadvancements \nhave fundamentally \nchanged the trajectory of HIV, with the evolution of \n\n5 \nroutine screening to enable early detection to the \nadvent of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) which \npromises nearly 100% effectiveness in the prevention \nof HIV and is the central object of Respondents\u2019 \ncomplaint. Today, we are closer than ever to ending \nHIV\u2019s painful 44-year ordeal. \nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(\u201cACA\u201d) requires that insurers cover Task Force-\nrecommended preventive services without cost-\nsharing. The Task Force, which has existed since \n1984, \nmade \nevidence-based \npreventive \ncare \nrecommendations before the enactment of the ACA. \nCongress \nincorporated \nthe \nTask \nForce\u2019s \nrecommendations into the ACA to ensure essential \npreventive services were covered. This requirement \nassures access to HIV screening and PrEP for millions \nof Americans at risk of acquiring HIV.

Id. This is \nunacceptable in our modern era. Without continued \naccess to the no-cost prevention assured under the \nACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation \nwill witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV \nresurges. \nViral hepatitis stands alongside HIV/AIDS as \none of our nation\u2019s most critical and under-addressed \npublic health challenges.

Hepatitis, an inflammation of the \nliver, affects Americans from all walks of life. Like \nHIV, hepatitis affects individuals of all ages, genders \nand ethnicities, though it disproportionately impacts \nthose with underlying health conditions. Viral \nHepatitis \nBasics, \nCDC \n(July \n30, \n2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/f7x2abrm. HBV and HCV are \nleading causes of liver disease, affecting millions of \nAmericans and often remaining asymptomatic until \nlife-threatening complications, such as cirrhosis, liver \nfailure or cancer, arise. Id. \nIn the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began \ndistinguishing different strains of hepatitis. The \ndiscovery of HBV, and identification of an HBV \nantigen, paved the way for development of a safe and \neffective HBV vaccine. Id. Widespread attention to \nHBV in subsequent decades culminated in significant \ndeclines \nin \nnew \ninfections \namong \nvaccinated \npopulations. Said A.

Erin E. Conners, et al., \nScreening and Testing for Hepatitis B Virus Infection: \nCDC Recommendations \u2014 United States, 2023, 72 \nMMWR 1,1 (2023). While there is no cure for HBV, \nantiviral therapies can help suppress the virus, \nreduce liver damage and lower the risk of \ntransmission. Hans L.

Building \non this earlier research, HCV was discovered in 1989. \nChristian Trepo, A Brief History of Hepatitis \nMilestones, 34 LIVER INT\u2019L 29, 29 (2014). \nInitially, few treatment options existed, and \nmany individuals infected with the virus were \ndiagnosed only after considerable liver damage had \nalready occurred. Advances in screening technology \nand more effective therapies in the 1990s and 2000s \nmade it possible to detect hepatitis sooner and \nmanage its progression. By the 2010s, direct-acting \nantiviral treatments for HCV emerged, offering cure \nrates of approximately 95 percent when administered \nearly, a remarkable achievement that transformed \nthe clinical outlook for HCV-infected patients. Viral \nHepatitis \nBasics, \nCDC \n(July \n30, \n2024), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/f7x2abrm. While a vaccine exists \nfor HBV, there is no vaccine to prevent HCV, making \nearly detection and treatment the only effective \nmeans of preventing its devastating complications.  \nDespite these advancements, as of 2020, \napproximately 880,000 U.S. adults are living with \n\n19 \nchronic HBV, and an estimated 14,000 new infections \noccur each year. Id. Since 2012, HCV has led to more \ndeaths than all other reportable infectious diseases \n(except COVID-19) combined. Approximately 15-30% \nof individuals living with HIV in the United States \nare co-infected with HCV. David H.

Id. \nThe indispensable role of early detection \nparallels the experience with HIV, where routine \ntesting has been essential to achieving significant \nreductions in morbidity and mortality. For both HIV \nand hepatitis, widespread screening, coupled with \nprompt and appropriate therapeutic interventions, \nnot only saves lives but also yields significant cost \nsavings for both the health care system and affected \nindividuals. \n\n20 \nD. \nThe \nViability \nof \nthe \nACA \nFramework Is Dependent on Its \nPreventive \nServices \nCoverage \nRequirement. \nCongress passed the ACA \u201cin order to improve \nhealth insurance markets.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. \nv. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 521-22 (2012). The ACA\u2019s \nstructure has been referred to as a \u201cthree-legged \nstool\u201d: (1) the individual mandate and minimum \nessential coverage; (2) guaranteed issue; and (3) \nsubsidies to ensure access. Sabrina Corlette, et al., \nThe ACA\u2019s Effect on the Individual Insurance Market, \n39 HEALTH AFFAIRS 436, 437 (2020). The first leg of \nthe stool was intended to promote good health \noutcomes and reduce health care costs by ensuring \nthat the vast majority of Americans receive high \nquality health insurance that includes first-dollar \ncoverage of preventive care. \nThe ACA intended for the Task Force to \nrecommend those preventive services that were so \nessential to the public\u2019s health that they should be \navailable without cost-sharing for Americans with \ninsurance \ncoverage. \nFor \nexample, \nunder \nthis \nframework, the Task Force undertook a rigorous \nevaluation of HIV testing, PrEP and hepatitis \npreventive services, awarding Grade A and Grade B \nratings \non \nsuch \nservices \nand \ninterventions. \nSubsequent health insurer coverage has allowed for \nAmericans to access such services and interventions \nwithout cost-sharing.  \nIf the Court were to whittle away the first leg \nof the ACA\u2019s stool by voiding the only mechanism the \n\n21 \nACA has contemplated to mandate most preventive \nservices be available without cost-sharing, fewer \npeople will have access to preventive services, \nincluding PrEP and screenings for HIV and hepatitis. \nThis will undermine the ACA\u2019s strategy to balance \nrisk pools by ensuring a floor of covered benefits and \na strengthened primary care ecosystem. It would \nuproot the intentional design of the ACA and may \nbegin to destabilize the insurance market, as plans\u2019 \nrisk pools will be sicker, and, therefore, costlier. \nStripping the Task Force of its role will result \nin dire consequences for the insurance market and \nalso for public health. The first-dollar coverage of \npreventive services is imperative in promoting access \nto PrEP and screenings for HIV and hepatitis. When \npatients are forced to bear the cost of preventive \nservices, they are less likely to utilize such services; \nin fact, research has demonstrated that a copayment \nas low as $5 will lower utilization. Brian Schilling, \nHitting the Copay Sweet Spot, THE COMMONWEALTH \nFUND, https://tinyurl.com/ywuh826f (last visited Feb. \n24, 2025). \nEliminating cost-free PrEP coverage \nwould also undermine decades of progress in HIV \nprevention. \nRecent \nresearch \nunderscores \nthe \ndevastating consequences of introducing financial \nbarriers to essential preventive care. A 2024 study \nfound that even a small increase in out-of-pocket costs \nfrom $0 to $10 doubled PrEP abandonment rates, \nwhile costs exceeding $500 resulted in abandonment \nrates of over 40%. Lorraine T. Dean, et al., Estimating \nthe Impact of Out-of-Pocket Cost Changes on \nAbandonment of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, 43 \nHEALTH AFFAIRS 36, 37 (2024). Alarmingly, HIV \ndiagnoses were two to three times higher among \n\n22 \nindividuals who abandoned PrEP prescriptions \ncompared to those who filled them. Another study \nfrom the Yale School of Public Health, conducted in \nresponse to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling in Braidwood, \nestimates that for every 10% reduction in PrEP \ncoverage, the U.S. could see more than 1,100 \nadditional HIV infections annually\u2014a lower-bound \nestimate given the limited study population. A. David \nPaltiel, et al., Increased HIV Transmissions with \nReduced Insurance Coverage for HIV Pre-Exposure \nProphylaxis: Potential Consequences of Braidwood \nManagement v. Becerra 4 (Oxford Univ. Press 2023). \nThis data suggests that any rollback of mandatory \ncoverage will force some current PrEP users to \ndiscontinue treatment, placing them at immediate \nrisk of acquiring or transmitting HIV. \nAccess to Task Force-recommended HIV and \nhepatitis screening without cost-sharing is a critical \nlifeline for all Americans. Full coverage of screening \nenables individuals who might otherwise never \npursue testing to discover their serostatus early and \nreceive timely, effective treatment. Imposing cost \nbarriers \nwould \ndeter \nmany \nfrom \nundergoing \nscreening, \njeopardizing \nearly \ndetection \nand \nundermining broader public health efforts to stop \ntransmission of these viruses. Rolling back these \nmeasures would risk a resurgence of undetected \nhepatitis \ninfections, \nleading \nto \nincreased \nhospitalizations and costly liver transplants. \nSimilarly, full coverage of PrEP products \nfosters continuous and widespread use of these life-\nsaving drugs, thereby enhancing its effectiveness and \nreducing HIV transmission rates. Introducing out-of-\n\n23 \npocket costs for PrEP would undercut its widespread \nuse, affecting far more than individual health \noutcomes. It would lead to a cascade of public health \nchallenges, such as delayed diagnoses, new infections \nand the emergence of treatment-resistant strains, \nthat are difficult to reverse. Early HIV Diagnosis and \nTreatment Important for Better Long-term Health \nOutcomes, \nHIV.GOV \n(Nov. \n2, \n2022), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4z2mxdvm. \nEndorsing the Respondents\u2019 misguided logic \nand permitting the rollback of first-dollar PrEP \ncoverage would perpetuate the harmful stigma \nassociated \nwith \nHIV \nand \ndirectly \nundermine \nbipartisan public health efforts to combat these \ndiseases, triggering a significant backslide in our \ncountry\u2019s efforts to end the HIV epidemic, erasing \ndecades of progress and placing countless lives at \nunnecessary risk. \nII. \nTask Force Members are Inferior \nOfficers Whose Recommendations \nMust Be Approved by Principal \nOfficers Under the Affordable Care \nAct. \nThe design of the ACA entails a two-part \nprocess in order to execute the preventive services \ncoverage mandate: 1) that the independent Task \nForce would use evidence-based criteria to determine \nwhether a preventive service met the clinical \nthreshold for a Grade A or Grade B rating and 2) that \nfederal agency officials make policy decisions \nconcerning insurance coverage requirements with \nrespect to Task Force recommendations. \n\n24 \nThis hierarchy establishes that principal \nofficers supervise the determination of insurance \ncoverage requirement. The Task Force takes no part \nin the second step, rendering it no more than a \ncollection of inferior officers for constitutional \npurposes.  \nUnder Morrison, the court found that the \nIndependent Counsel Act of 1978 was constitutional, \ndespite the fact that the entity at issue was referred \nto as \u201cindependent,\u201d due to several factors, including \nwhether it has the \u201cauthority to formulate policy for \nthe Government or the Executive Branch.\u201d Morrison \nv. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671 (1988). Similarly, the Task \nForce statute entrusts seasoned experts to apply their \nindividual expertise in making evidence-based \ndeterminations \nto \nrecommend \npreventive \ncare \nservices, but only to formulate recommendations. Use \nof the word \u201cindependent\u201d within the statute refers to \nand preserves the evidence-based scientific process, \nallowing the members of the Task Force to \nindependently apply their expertise to formulate \nrecommendations. \nEven if this were not true, the inquiry into \nwhether an officer is inferior must go beyond the \nlanguage of the statute to look at the practical nature \nof how the role is carried out. Morrison, 487 U.S. at \n672-73 (finding that \u201cindependent counsel\u201d were \nnevertheless \ninferior \nofficers). \nHere, \nmyriad \nindicators show that the Task Force\u2019s role is carried \nout in a manner consistent with that of inferior \nofficers. \n\n25 \nThe \nTask \nForce \nhas \ncarried \nout \nits \nresponsibilities since 1984 and has long been \nunderstood as an independent body. Procedure \nManual, \nUSPSTF \n(Apr. \n2023), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/2mmfc98v. \nHowever, \nits \nindependence and freedom from political influence \ndoes not equate a lack of political accountability for \nits recommendations. Instead, only its process of \nreviewing evidence and making recommendations for \nclinical preventive services are cordoned off by the \nenabling statute. This process and its resulting \nrecommendations are distinct from and only serve to \ninform the policymaking function delegated to the \nexecutive branch under health insurance law. \nSimilarly, freedom from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d is \nnot freedom from oversight or accountability. Rather, \nit is further evidence that this provision is meant to \nprotect \nthe \nintegrity \nof \nthe \nevidence-based \nrecommendation process. Otherwise, the output \u2014 \nthe recommendations themselves \u2014 might be \ninfluenced to conform to political whims rather than \nevidence. \nThe word \u201cindependent\u201d also does not foreclose \noversight \nof \nthe \nutilization \nof \nTask \nForce \nrecommendations by the Secretary of HHS, who \nretains sole authority to accept any recommendation \nfor purposes of determining those services which \nhealth insurers must cover. \nThis degree of oversight is sufficient for our \npurposes, as the Appointments Clause does not \nrequire that an inferior officer\u2019s superior be involved \nin every level of decision making, just direction and \n\n26 \nsupervision at \u201csome level.\u201d Edmond v. United States, \n520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997). Such is the case here, where \nsuperiors are involved not in the evidence review and \nrecommendation processes, but in the subsequent \npolicymaking utilized to effectuate the ACA\u2019s \ncoverage requirement. \nA.  \nTask Force Members are Inferior \nOfficers Who Develop Evidence-\nBased \nRecommendations, \nNot \nPolicy. \nSince 1989, the Task Force has published its \nGuide to Clinical Preventive Services. Guide to \nClinical Preventive Services: An Assessment of the \nEffectiveness of 169 Interventions, USPSTF (1989). \nSince at least 1996, this guide has included the \nexplicit statement that its recommendations \u201care \nindependent of the U.S. Government. They should not \nbe construed as an official position of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (\u201cAHRQ\u201d) or the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\u201d \nGuide to Clinical Preventive Services, USPSTF (1996). \nThe Task Force\u2019s distance from policymaking \nhas been consistently demonstrated by the executive \nbranch, even predating the passage of the ACA. In \n2009, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius rejected a \nTask Force recommendation that women ages 40-49 \nnot receive mammograms, stressing that the \nrecommendation \nwas \nissued \nby \n\u201can \noutside \nindependent panel of doctors and scientists who . . . \ndo not set federal policy and . . . don\u2019t determine what \nservices are covered by the federal government.\u201d Rob \nStein & Dan Eggen, White House Backs Off Cancer \n\n27 \nTest Guidelines, WASH. POST (Nov. 19, 2009), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3c8h8zue.  \nThus, its \u201cindependent charge to focus on the \nscience of prevention\u201d long preceded the ACA and \nremained intact following its enactment. Gregory \nCurfman & Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, US Preventive \nServices Task Force Challenged in Federal Court, 329 \nJAMA 1743, 1743 (2023). In carrying out this charge, \nthe Task Force engages in a substantial and complex \nundertaking. Its evidence review process prior to \nissuing its recommendations is notable in its \nthoroughness and consistency, entailing at least eight \ndistinct steps, including: \n1. \nConsideration \nof \ntopics \nsubmitted \nfor \nits \nconsideration \nby \nthe \ngeneral public; \n2. \nDevelopment of a research \nplan; \n3. \nReceipt \nand \nreview \nof \npublic comments on the \nresearch plan; \n4. \nReview of peer-reviewed \nevidence; \n5. \nDevelopment of a draft \nrecommendation; \n6. \nReceipt \nand \nreview \nof \npublic comments on the \ndraft recommendation; \n7. \nFinalization \nof \nthe \nrecommendation; and \n\n28 \n8. \nVote \non \nthe \nrecommendation.3 \n \nNone of these steps involve promulgating a regulation \nor mandating a course of action. This process and the \nresulting recommendations are distinct from and only \nserve to inform the policymaking function delegated \nto the executive branch under health insurance law. \nWhen amending the enabling statute and \nadopting the ACA\u2019s requirement to cover Task Force \nrecommendations, Congress was presumably aware \nof these processes given the Task Force\u2019s existence for \n26 years prior to the ACA\u2019s enactment. In doing so, it \ncordoned off as independent its process of reviewing \nevidence and making recommendations for clinical \npreventive services. \nIn reinforcing this independence, Congress and \nthe executive branch did not push the Task Force \nacross the threshold into a policymaking function. \nInstead, the Task Force has explicitly distanced itself \nfrom the complexities of determining insurance \ncoverage requirements and is solely a body to provide \nrecommendations based on the most current scientific \nand medical literature.

Rather, that role is \nreserved under Title XXVII of the Public Health \nService Act (PHSA) to three agencies \u2013 the United \nStates Departments of Health and Human Services, \nLabor, and Treasury \u2013 known as \u201cthe tri-agencies.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg, et seq. This has been the case since \nthe enactment of the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which \nestablished Title XXVII. Thus, when Congress \nenacted the ACA and its preventive services coverage \nframework, \nit \namended \na \npreexisting \nhealth \ninsurance regulatory framework administered by the \ntri-agencies. \n \nThis oversight function alone satisfies the \nrequired Appointments Clause analysis as, once \nrecommendations are made, politically accountable \nofficials are free to circumscribe the recommendations \nin the course of implementing the ACA\u2019s preventive \nservices coverage requirement. \nStated plainly, if the Secretary of HHS \ndetermines he does not wish to cover a Task Force-\nrecommended item or service, he maintains the \ndiscretion to override the recommendations for \npurposes of determining which of those must be \ncovered by health insurers. \n\n30 \nIn carrying out their responsibilities to \neffectuate insurance coverage under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n300gg-13, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1185d, and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9815, \nthe tri-agencies promulgated implementing rules. 45 \nCFR \u00a7 147.130; 29 CFR \u00a7 2590.715-2713; 26 CFR \u00a7 \n54.9815-2713. The very first subsection of these rules \ndelineate a policy that requires group health plans or \nhealth insurance issuers to cover A- and B-rated Task \nForce \nrecommendations \nwithout \ncost-sharing \nrequirements. 45 CFR \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(i); 29 CFR \u00a7 \n2590.715-2713(a)(1)(i); \n26 \nCFR \n\u00a7 \n54.9815-\n2713(a)(1)(i). For the sake of expediency, the tri-\nagencies issued this policy via an interim final rule. \n75 Fed. Reg. 41726 (July 19, 2010). It was \nsubsequently codified following notice and comment \nrulemaking. 80 Fed. Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015). The \ntri-agencies also explicitly stated the timeline for \nimplementation of such Task Force recommendations \nand did not link that timing to any additional action \nundertaken by the tri-agencies. In other words, the \ntri-agencies \ndecided, \nusing \ntheir \nrulemaking \nauthority, to make the Task Force\u2019s Grade A and \nGrade B ratings self-effectuating with respect to \nmandatory first-dollar coverage, while still allowing \nfor the tri-agencies to review and accept the \nrecommendations as evidenced in the below list of \nactions. 45 CFR \u00a7 147.130(b)(1); 29 CFR \u00a7 2590.715-\n2713(b)(1); 26 CFR \u00a7 54.9815-2713(b)(1). \nThe \ntri-agencies \nwere \nnot \nthoughtlessly \ndeferential, reflexively outsourcing the responsibility \nof \ndetermining \nhealth \ninsurance \ncoverage \nrequirements to the Task Force.

Furthermore, the Court should \nrecognize Congress\u2019s intention on the face of the \nstatute to preserve political independence and \navoidance of political influence with respect to its \nrecommendation process, which is altogether distinct \nfrom the subsequent policy-making role retained by \npolitically accountable principle. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nRichard H.

Collectively representing millions of \npeople across all 50 states, amici advocate for federal \npolicies that increase access to and utilization of life-\nsaving preventive-care measures such as cancer \nscreenings, tobacco-cessation programs, and medic-\nations that reduce the risk of HIV and AIDS. \nAmici submit this brief to explain that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act provisions that \nguarantee patients\u2019 access to cost-free coverage for \npreventive-care measures recommended by the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force are both lawful and \ncritically important for public health. This Court\u2019s \nprecedents establish that Congress may incorporate \nthe evidence-based findings of disinterested expert \nbodies like the Task Force into law without \nimplicating the Appointments Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. Amici have a strong interest in defend-\ning Congress\u2019s decision to follow such a course here, \ngiven the vital role that the cost-free coverage that \nCongress mandated for recommended preventive \nservices plays in protecting the health of millions of \n \n1 This brief was not written in any part by counsel for a party. \nNo one other than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. \n\n \n2 \nAmericans who may otherwise be deterred from \naccessing life-saving care. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe parties to this case debate the wrong question: \nwhether members of the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force (Task Force) are inferior or principal \nofficers of the United States within the meaning of the \nAppointments Clause. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, \nthe proper answer to the first question presented in \nthis case\u2014whether the structure of the Task Force \nviolates the Appointments Clause\u2014is no, because the \nmedical experts who periodically take part in the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations about clinical preventive-\nhealth services are not officers of the United States at \nall, and the Appointments Clause says nothing about \nhow they may or must be appointed.  \nSince its inception in 1984, the Task Force has had \none central task: to make expert recommendations to \nthe medical community about which preventive-care \nmeasures have been reliably shown to promote patient \nhealth. These evidence-based recommendations cover \ndozens of potentially life-saving clinical services. In \n2010, Congress endorsed the recommendations\u2019 \nreliability by incorporating them into the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Pub. L. No. \n111-148, 124 Stat. 119, and requiring covered insurers \nto provide cost-free coverage for the recommended \nservices. Even after the ACA\u2019s passage, the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations are directed to the medical \ncommunity and are based solely on scientific evidence, \nnot on policy considerations about insurance coverage. \nCongress\u2019s decision to tie the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s clinical \nrecommendations did not convert the Task Force\u2019s \n\n \n3 \nmembers into federal officers subject to the Appoint-\nments Clause. To begin with, a member of the Task \nForce\u2014which is convened periodically on a volunteer \nbasis for a limited factfinding purpose\u2014does not hold \na federal \u201coffice\u201d in the first place. And either way, the \nTask Force does not have significant authority to \nexecute or apply federal law. As this Court\u2019s decisions \nhave long recognized, disinterested experts whom \nCongress has empowered to make discrete, empirical \njudgments on matters within their professional \nexpertise do not perform the enforcement or \npolicymaking duties that implicate the Appointments \nClause\u2014even where those judgments trigger legal \nconsequences. In holding that the Task Force\u2019s \nmembers are improperly appointed federal officers, \nthe decision below departed from this longstanding \nprinciple and cast constitutional doubt on numerous \nother legal provisions that incorporate the work of \nexpert professional bodies into federal law.  \nAffirming the erroneous decision below would \nvitiate Congress\u2019s sound judgment about how best to \nprotect public health. In enacting the ACA\u2019s \npreventive-care provisions, Congress recognized that \nearly diagnosis and treatment of serious medical \nconditions can dramatically improve health outcomes \nand can save money and lives. In the years since the \nACA\u2019s enactment, millions of Americans have come to \nrely on cost-free access to a wide range of preventive \nservices, including medications that reduce the risk of \nheart attack and stroke, screenings that can reduce \nthe risk of dying from lung cancer, and counseling that \ncan promote healthy pregnancies. Research shows \nthat the imposition of cost-sharing requirements for \nthese and other preventive services would sharply \nreduce the rate at which patients access them, thus \n\n \n4 \nreviving the public-health risks that Congress \npermissibly (and wisely) sought to address in the \nACA. Because the Constitution does not require such \na disruptive result, this Court should reverse. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Task Force is an expert body of health-\ncare professionals that has offered objective, \nevidence-based \nrecommendations \nto \nthe \nmedical community for over forty years. \n \nA. The Task Force originated in 1984 as a \ntemporary 20-member expert body convened within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nby \nthe \nPublic \nHealth \nService \nto \n\u201cdevelop[] \nrecommendations for clinicians on the appropriate use \nof preventive interventions, based on a systematic \nreview of evidence of clinical effectiveness.\u201d Task \nForce, Guide to Clinical Preventive Services: Report of \nthe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Overview (2d \ned. 1996), https://tinyurl.com/admzts59. In 1989, the \nfirst Task Force published its \u201ccomprehensive \nrecommendations\u201d regarding \u201cpreventive services for \n60 topic areas affecting patients from infancy to old \nage.\u201d Id. The following year, the Task Force was \nreconstituted as a 10-member body composed of family \nphysicians, internists, pediatricians, obstetrician-\ngynecologists, and methodologists, and was directed to \nupdate the recommendations based on the most recent \nscientific evidence. Id. The Task Force\u2019s second \niteration finished its work in 1996, and a third \niteration \nwas \nconvened \nin \n1998 \nto \nmake \nrecommendations on a rolling basis. See Task Force, \nProcedure Manual at 1 (May 2021) (Task Force, \nProcedure Manual), https://tinyurl.com/24nfkf9p.  \n\n \n5 \nIn 1999, the Task Force received congressional \nimprimatur with the passage of the Healthcare \nResearch and Quality Act, Pub. L. No. 106-129, 113 \nStat. 1653 (1999 Act). See Task Force, Procedure \nManual, app. I, at 56. The 1999 Act established the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) \nwithin the Public Health Service, see 1999 Act, \u00a7 2(a), \n113 Stat. at 1653, and it empowered the AHRQ \nDirector to \u201cperiodically convene a Preventive \nServices Task Force \u2026 composed of individuals with \nappropriate expertise\u201d to \u201creview the scientific \nevidence related to the effectiveness, appropriateness, \nand cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive services \nfor the purpose of developing recommendations for the \nhealth care community, and updating previous \nclinical preventive recommendations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2(a), 113 \nStat. at 1659, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The AHRQ has continuously main-\ntained the Task Force as a standing body since 2001. \nSee Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2. Today, the \nTask Force consists of 16 volunteer members who \nserve on a rotating basis for staggered terms. Id. at i, \n2. Members are \u201cnationally recognized experts in \nprevention, evidence-based medicine, and primary \ncare who are also skilled in the critical evaluation of \nresearch and the implementation of evidence-based \nrecommendations in clinical practice.\u201d Id. at 2.  \nThe Task Force\u2019s clinical recommendations derive \nfrom a rigorous 4-step process that incorporates input \nfrom federal health agencies, partner organizations \nrepresenting primary care clinicians and other \nstakeholders, and the general public. See id. at 7\u201312. \nFirst, the Task Force selects a preventive-care topic to \nprioritize based on factors such as \u201cthe topic\u2019s \nimportance for public health\u201d and \u201cthe potential \n\n \n6 \nimpact of [a] recommendation.\u201d Task Force, USPSTF: \nWho We Are & How We Work, at 3 (2022) (Task Force, \nWho We Are), https://tinyurl.com/22e9ewek. Second, \nthe Task Force partners with \u201can academic or \nresearch organization with expertise in conducting \nsystematic evidence reviews\u201d to draft a research plan, \nwhich the Task Force finalizes after a 4-week public \ncomment period. Id. Third, the partner organization\u2019s \nresearchers \u201cgather, review, and analyze evidence on \nthe \n[selected] \ntopic \nfrom \nhigh-quality \nstudies \npublished in peer-reviewed scientific journals,\u201d after \nwhich the Task Force assesses the findings, creates a \ndraft recommendation, and opens the draft to public \ncomment. Id. Last, the Task Force finalizes the \nrecommendation based on the evidence review and \npublic comments and assigns the recommendation a \nletter grade to indicate its strength. Id. \nTask Force recommendations now \u201ccover more \nthan 80 preventive service topics for people across the \nlifespan\u2014from vision screening in young children, to \nheart disease prevention in adults, to colorectal cancer \nscreening in older adults.\u201d Id. at 1. While \u201cpolicy-\nmakers, managed care organizations, public and \nprivate payers, quality improvement organizations, \nresearch institutions, and patients\u201d all draw insights \nfrom the Task Force\u2019s work, \u201cthe main audience for \nTask Force recommendations is the primary care \nclinician.\u201d Task Force, Procedure Manual at 2; see also \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (defining the recommend-\nations\u2019 main audience as \u201cindividuals and organi-\nzations delivering clinical services\u201d). \nB. In the 2010 ACA, Congress incorporated some \nof the Task Force\u2019s expert recommendations into \nfederal law. Recognizing that preventive care plays a \ncritical role in promoting public health, see infra at pp. \n\n \n7 \n15\u201317, Congress required that insurers cover certain \npreventive services without passing on any portion of \nthe cost to the patient. Among the services included \nwithin this coverage requirement are all \u201cevidence-\nbased items or services\u201d that hold an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d grade \nfrom the Task Force. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). An \n\u201cA\u201d grade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net \nbenefit\u201d of a given service \u201cis substantial,\u201d while a \u201cB\u201d \ngrade represents \u201chigh certainty that the net benefit \nis moderate or \u2026 moderate certainty that the net \nbenefit is moderate to substantial.\u201d Task Force, Grade \nDefinitions (June 2018), https://tinyurl.com/3mcx\n9hsu. \nAlthough the Task Force\u2019s clinical recommend-\nations can trigger the ACA\u2019s coverage requirement, \nCongress directed that the recommendations remain \n\u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nAccordingly, and consistent with its longstanding \nmission of \u201cprovid[ing] primary care clinicians and \ntheir patients with information about the benefits and \nharms of a wide range of preventive services so that \ntogether they can make informed health care \ndecisions that are best for each patient,\u201d Task Force, \nWho We Are at 1, the Task Force continues to base its \nrecommendations on scientific and medical evidence, \nnot on insurance coverage considerations, id. at 6. As \nthe Task Force has explained, \u201c[c]overage decisions \nare determined by payors and policymakers.\u201d Id.; see \nTask Force, USPSTF: An Overview (2021), https:// \ntinyurl.com/mryspuua (\u201cAlthough the [ACA] created a \nlink between [Task Force] recommendations and \ninsurance coverage requirements, the Task Force \nmakes its recommendations based solely on the \nscientific evidence.\u201d). \n\n \n8 \nII.  The ACA\u2019s incorporation of Task Force \nrecommendations does not convert Task \nForce members into federal officers subject \nto the Appointments Clause. \nThe Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution \nsets out the methods for validly installing \u201cOfficers of \nthe United States,\u201d including any \u201cinferior Officers.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. Respondents here argue \nthat the structure of the Task Force violates the \nAppointments Clause. In the court of appeals, \nhowever, neither the parties nor the court addressed \nthe threshold question whether the Task Force \nmembers are federal \u201cofficers\u201d who are subject to the \nAppointments Clause in the first place, as the parties \n\u201cdispute[d] only whether Task Force members are \n\u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018inferior\u2019 officers.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. The \ncourt then held that the Task Force members are \n\u201cprincipal officers of the United States who have not \nbeen validly appointed under \u2026 [the] Constitution,\u201d \nid. at 2a, and enjoined Petitioners from requiring \nRespondents to comply with the ACA\u2019s directive to \nprovide cost-free coverage for preventive services that \nthe Task Force has recommended since the ACA\u2019s \nenactment or will recommend in the future, see id. at \n47a. But despite the parties\u2019 agreement below, this \nCourt should address the threshold question, \nencompassed in the first question presented, whether \nTask Force members are officers at all. They are not. \nNot every person who occupies a role set out in a \nfederal statute is an officer of the United States. The \nconcept of an office \u201cembraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties\u201d that are \u201ccontinuing \nand permanent, not occasional or temporary.\u201d United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511\u201312 (1878). And \neven where a person occupies a federal position that \n\n \n9 \ndoes hold these characteristics, that person is not \nsubject to the Appointments Clause\u2019s requirements if \nthe person\u2019s statutory duties entail \u201cappropriate \nlegislative functions\u201d or objective expert factfinding, \nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 128 (1976) (per curiam), \nrather than \u201csignificant authority\u201d to execute or \nenforce federal law, id. at 126. Here, Task Force \nmembers are not federal officers, both because they do \nnot hold federal offices and, in any event, because \ntheir circumscribed factfinding roles would not bring \nthem within the ambit of the Appointments Clause. \nA. Nearly 150 years ago, this Court held in a pair \nof cases that a person who periodically performs \nspecific tasks that aid the government is not an officer \nsubject to the Appointments Clause. See Auffmordt v. \nHedden, 137 U.S. 310, 326\u201328 (1890); Germaine, 99 \nU.S. at 512. In reaching this holding, Germaine and \nAuffmordt relied on the definition of a \u201cpublic officer\u201d \nin this Court\u2019s seminal decision in United States v. \nHartwell, 73 U.S. 385 (1868). There, the Court \nequated an \u201cofficer\u201d with one who holds an \u201coffice,\u201d \nand went on to say: \u201cAn office is a public station, or \nemployment, conferred by the appointment of \ngovernment. The term embraces the ideas of tenure, \nduration, emolument, and duties.\u201d Id. at 393. \nApplying that understanding of the term, Germaine \nand Auffmordt held the Appointments Clause \ninapplicable to persons who performed work to aid the \ngovernment but were not appointed to employment as \nholders of public offices with the characteristics of \ncontinuing tenure, duration, emoluments, or duties. \nTask Force members do not hold federal offices. \nThe members are all professionals who volunteer to \nperform occasional factfinding work as part of the \nTask Force outside of their regular employment with \n\n \n10 \nuniversities, hospitals, and other workplaces. See \nTask \nForce, \nOur \nMembers, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/\n2v2r92pm (linking to the biographies of the current \nTask Force members). They convene as the Task Force \njust three times per year, see Task Force, Procedure \nManual at 2, with the limited purpose of making \nclinical recommendations to healthcare providers \nbased on \u201cscientific evidence related to the effective-\nness, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness of \nclinical preventive services,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  \nThe Task Force\u2019s duties \u201care not continuing and \npermanent, and they are occasional and intermittent.\u201d \nGermaine, 99 U.S. at 512. The Task Force is \u201conly to \nact when called on by [AHRQ].\u201d Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (calling on the AHRQ Director to \n\u201cconvene\u201d the Task Force). The Task Force \u201cis \nrequired to keep no place of business for the public \nuse\u201d and its members \u201cgive[ ] no bond and take[ ] no \noath.\u201d Germaine, 99 U.S. at 512. Meanwhile, \u201c[n]o \nregular \nappropriation \nis \nmade \nto \npay \n[the] \ncompensation\u201d of the Task Force, which consists of \nvolunteers. Id. A Task Force member is \u201cremovable \u2026 \nat [the] pleasure\u201d of the HHS Secretary, and \u201c[t]here \nis no penalty for his absence from duty or refusal to \nperform.\u201d Id. Consequently, the Task Force members \ndo not occupy federal offices. \nThis conclusion follows even though the role of the \nTask Force is set out in a federal statute. In Germaine, \ncivil surgeons appointed by the Commissioner of \nPensions were not federal officers even though a \nstatute empowered the Commissioner to hire them for \n\u201cthe periodical examination of pensioners\u201d and \nprovided that they \u201cshall be paid\u201d for their services. \nId. at 508 (emphasis omitted). And in Auffmordt, \nmerchant appraisers appointed by the Secretary of the \n\n \n11 \nTreasury were not federal officers even though their \nduties (which determined the amounts of import \nduties owed by those who brought goods into the \nUnited States) were established by federal statute, \ntoo. 137 U.S. at 312. What mattered instead was that \nneither a civil surgeon nor a merchant appraiser was \n\u201ca \u2018person employed\u2019\u201d in the federal government but \nrather was \u201can expert\u201d who had \u201cno general functions, \nnor any employment which has any duration as to \ntime, or which extends over any case further than as \nhe [was] selected to act.\u201d Id. at 326\u201327.  \nPut simply, without a federal office to hold, neither \nthe surgeons nor the appraisers could plausibly be \nfederal officers, inferior or principal. The same is true \nof the Task Force members. \nB. Task Force members are not federal officers for \nthe additional reason that they lack \u201csignificant \nauthority\u201d to execute or enforce federal law. Buckley, \n424 U.S. at 126. Although this standard \u201cis no doubt \nframed in general terms,\u201d Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, \n245 (2018), this Court has held that the Appointments \nClause is not implicated where Congress provides for \na federal worker who performs \u201cappropriate legis-\nlative functions,\u201d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 128, or who is \n\u201can expert, selected as such,\u201d to bring his or her \n\u201cspecial knowledge\u201d to bear conclusively on empirical \nmatters affecting private citizens\u2019 rights and duties. \nAuffmordt, 137 U.S. at 326\u201327. With respect to the \nTask Force, Congress has done exactly what this \nCourt\u2019s precedents permit: It has charged the Task \nForce\u2014a group of volunteer experts\u2014with evaluating \nthe body of contemporary scientific literature and \nmaking disinterested, evidence-based recommenda-\ntions for healthcare providers regarding effective \npreventive measures. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). In \n\n \n12 \nmaking those factual judgments about clinical best \npractices, Task Force members do not wield \nsignificant federal authority. \nThis conclusion finds strong support in this Court\u2019s \nAuffmordt decision. That case addressed a statute \nthat empowered merchant appraisers to assess the \nvalue of imported goods under certain circumstances \nfor purposes of calculating the amount of customs \nduties owed on the goods. See 137 U.S. at 312. \nAlthough the statute \u201cma[de] the decision of the \nappraisers final,\u201d id. at 329, the Court held that the \nappraisers were not officers, but \u201cexpert assistant[s] \nto aid in ascertaining the value of the goods.\u201d Id. at \n327. In so holding, the Court emphasized the \ncircumscribed \u201cduties and discretion,\u201d Freytag v. \nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 881 (1991), of the \nappraisers, who were \u201cselected for [their] special \nknowledge in regard to the character and value of the \nparticular goods in question\u201d and had \u201cno general \nfunctions\u201d or power \u201cto act except as [they] may be \ndesignated\u201d to discharge the narrow responsibilities of \nan expert factfinder. Auffmordt, 137 U.S. at 327; see \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 22 (2021) \n(suggesting that members of ad hoc adjudicatory \nbodies authorized by early federal patent statutes \n\u201cmay not have even [held] offices\u201d for purposes of the \nAppointments Clause because they \u201cassembled to \nresolve a single issue\u201d and held \u201climited power\u201d \ndespite making \u201cfinal decisions\u201d on discrete matters \nwithin their expert authority). \nTask Force members\u2019 statutory duties resemble \nthose of Auffmordt\u2019s appraisers far more closely than \nthey resemble the duties of functionaries whom this \nCourt has held to be officers. Like the appraisers, Task \nForce members are required to draw on their profess-\n\n \n13 \nional expertise to make discrete factual determin-\nations on specific empirical matters. Unlike the \nadministrative law judges and special trial judges \nheld to be officers in Lucia and Freytag, Task Force \nmembers do not wield quasi-judicial authority by \n\u201cpresiding over adversarial hearings,\u201d Lucia, 585 U.S. \nat 247, in which they \u201ctake testimony, conduct trials, \nrule on the admissibility of evidence, and have the \npower to enforce compliance with discovery orders,\u201d \nid. (quoting Freytag, 501 U.S. at 881\u201382). And unlike \nthe Federal Election Commission\u2014whose members \nwere held to be officers in Buckley\u2014the Task Force \nhas no power to \u201cformulate general policy,\u201d create \nlegal safe harbors by issuing advisory opinions on \nregulated parties\u2019 legal compliance, make discretion-\nary exceptions to congressional mandates, or perform \n\u201cdirect and wide ranging\u201d enforcement activities. \nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 110\u201311 (citation omitted). \nThat Congress has now tied the scope of insurers\u2019 \ncoverage obligations to the Task Force\u2019s factual \njudgments about clinical efficacy\u2014just as Congress \ntied the amount of importers\u2019 customs duties to \nmerchant appraisers\u2019 factual judgments about the \nvalue of the importers\u2019 goods\u2014does not change the \nnature of the Task Force\u2019s functions. Both before and \nafter the ACA\u2019s enactment, the Task Force conducted \nthe same expert assessment of scientific evidence, \napplying \nthe \nsame \ncriteria \nto \nmake \nclinical \nrecommendations to healthcare providers through the \nsame multi-step process. The Task Force makes no \nlegal or policy judgments about whether particular \nforms of care should be provided without charge to \ninsured patients, issues no directives to insurers (or, \nindeed, to anyone), and plays no role in enforcing any \n\n \n14 \nlegal obligations that Congress may attach to its \nrecommendations. \nRather, recognizing that the Task Force\u2019s expert \ndeterminations on factual matters had yielded \nreliable results over the two decades leading up to the \nACA\u2019s enactment, Congress decided that insurers \nmust cover preventive services that the Task Force \ndetermines are medically effective. Incorporation of \nan expert body\u2019s work into federal law is common-\nplace. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 8003(c)(1)(A)(i) (requiring \n\u201ceach public pool and spa in the United States\u201d to \ncomply with certain privately promulgated \u201cperform-\nance standard[s], or any successor standard\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1395i-3(d)(4)(A) (requiring \u201cskilled nursing \nfacilit[ies]\u201d to comply with \u201caccepted professional \nstandards and principles\u201d); id. \u00a7 7385s-2(b) (directing \ncertain \u201cminimum impairment rating[s]\u201d for workers\u2019 \ncompensation purposes to \u201cbe determined in accord-\nance with\u201d American Medical Association standards); \n20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.601(b) (defining \u201cdisability\u201d for \nworkers\u2019 compensation purposes by incorporating \nstandards from \u201cthe most currently revised edition\u201d of \nan American Medical Association publication); 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 707.60(c)(2)(ii) (providing that a chemical \nsubstance is \u201cconsidered to be a known or potential \nhuman carcinogen\u201d for regulatory purposes if it holds \na certain classification from the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s International Agency for Research on \nCancer); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 393.108(b) (providing that the \n\u201cmanufacturer\u2019s markings\u201d are dispositive as to the \nlawful \u201cworking load limit[]\u201d of a tiedown used to \nsecure cargo). \nAffirming the court of appeals\u2019 holding that the \nTask Force members are federal officers would thus \ncall into question the validity of any number of \n\n \n15 \nexisting legal requirements. Going forward, moreover, \nCongress would be foreclosed from relying on the \nempirical judgments of expert professional bodies \nunless it dramatically expanded the federal workforce \nby creating officer roles for those bodies\u2019 members. As \nthis Court has long recognized, the Constitution does \nnot require this destabilizing result. The Court should \nhold that Task Force members are not federal officers. \nIII.  Affirming the holding below would thwart \nan important and effective congressional \neffort to protect public health. \nBeyond undermining longstanding precedent and \nsowing jurisprudential disruption, affirming the lower \ncourt\u2019s \nconstitutional \nholding \nwould \nimperil \nCongress\u2019s critical efforts to protect the health\u2014and \npotentially the lives\u2014of millions of Americans. \nCongress has made the sound decision that Americans \nshould have cost-free access to preventive-care \nmeasures that expert clinicians have recognized as \nhaving a demonstrated track record of efficacy in \nimproving clinical outcomes. Affirming the decision \nbelow would strip that access from millions of citizens \nand create precisely the public-health risks that \nCongress has acted decisively to prevent. \nEven before the ACA, the medical community had \nlong recognized an important role for \u201c[h]igh-quality \npreventive care\u201d in \u201chelp[ing] Americans stay healthy, \navoid or delay the onset of disease, lead productive \nlives, and reduce costs.\u201d Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid \nServs., Background: The Affordable Care Act\u2019s New \nRules on Preventive Care (July 14, 2010) (CMS, \nBackground), https://tinyurl.com/yefyrsek.

Due to the new law, approximately 76 \nmillion Americans became eligible for expanded \ncoverage for preventive services.

Since then, vast numbers of \npeople have relied on the guarantee of cost-free \ncoverage for preventive services, with about 60 \npercent of insured Americans\u2014roughly 100 million \npeople\u2014utilizing such services in 2018.

This result would put \nmillions of patients at risk of losing cost-free access to \ncritical care and compromise clinical efforts to control \ncancer, reduce the spread of disease, and address \nother public-health concerns.

To take an example based on \njust one of the many services threatened by the \ndecision below, if insurers could pass on to patients \ncharges for receiving life-saving statins, research \nsuggests that many patients would discontinue use, \ndespite the health risks.

The Fifth Circuit nonetheless erroneously held \nthat Task Force members are principal officers who \nmust be appointed by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate.  And the court compounded its \nerror by then declining to sever the lone provision that, \nin its view, insulated the Task Force from secretarial \nsupervision.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision defies this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, declares an important federal stat-\nutory provision unconstitutional, and jeopardizes health-\ncare protections enjoyed by millions of Americans un-\nder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n(ACA), Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119.  \n\n2 \n \nAlthough respondents defend the judgment below on \nthe merits, they \u201cagree with the Solicitor General that \nthe Court should grant the petition for certiorari\u201d be-\ncause \u201c[t]he court of appeals determined that a key pro-\nvision of the Affordable Care Act violates Article II\u2019s \nAppointments Clause.\u201d  Br. in Support of Cert. 1.

Respondents Agree That The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision \nWarrants This Court\u2019s Review \nThe petition demonstrates (at 27-33) that the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision warrants review.  That decision held \nthat \u201cconstitutional problems  * * *  inhere in the Task \nForce\u2019s\u201d structure, Pet. App. 30a, and \u201cwhen a lower \ncourt has invalidated a federal statute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \n\u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant review, Iancu v. Brunetti, \n588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019).  The court of appeals\u2019 decision \nalso threatens to upend a key part of the ACA that pro-\nvides preventive-services coverage without cost- \nsharing for millions of Americans.   \nRespondents\u2019 brief supporting certiorari correctly \nrecognizes that the court of appeals declared unconsti-\ntutional \u201ca key provision of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d \nand that \u201cthis Court\u2019s usual practice\u201d in such circum-\nstances \u201cis to grant certiorari without awaiting a circuit \nsplit.\u201d  Br. in Support of Cert. 1; see id. at 19-20.  While \nrespondents characterize (id. at 2) our arguments about \nthe practical consequences of the decision below as \n\u201cdire predictions,\u201d they never explain how or why those \narguments are incorrect.  And numerous amici agree \nwith our assessment of the practical stakes.  See Amer-\nican Pub. Health Ass\u2019n Amici Br. 5-14; American Can-\ncer Soc\u2019y Amici Br. 20-28; 35 Health Care Access Orgs. \nAmici Br. 23-30; Illinois Amici Br. 4-19.  In any event, \n\n3 \n \nrespondents acknowledge (Br. in Support of Cert. 2) \nthat any \u201cdisagreements\u201d about the consequences of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision do not \u201caffect the certworthi-\nness of this case.\u201d \nThe petition further demonstrates (at 30-31) that ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, a future plaintiff with Article \nIII standing could sue in the Fifth Circuit and obtain a \nuniversal remedy as the default under circuit prece-\ndent, thus rendering the Task Force preventive- \nservices scheme inoperative nationwide.  Respondents \nlikewise recognize (Br. in Support of Cert. 22) that risk \nand agree that this Court should \u201cgrant certiorari be-\nfore allowing\u201d a lower court to grant such a universal \nremedy.1  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Wrong \nRespondents also contend (Br. in Support of Cert. \n24-34) that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct.  A \ncomplete discussion of the merits can await the full \nbriefing and argument that both parties agree is war-\nranted.  But respondents\u2019 discussion of the merits offers \nno persuasive defense of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  \n \n1 Respondents propose (Br. in Support of Cert. i) to split the pe-\ntition\u2019s question presented into two separate questions\u2014with one \naddressing the Appointments Clause and the other addressing sev-\nerability.  Respondents\u2019 proposal is unnecessary because the Ap-\npointments Clause and severability issues are both already ex-\npressly included in the petition\u2019s question presented, see Pet. i, and \ndividing them into two questions would neither alter the issues be-\nfore the Court nor otherwise aid the Court\u2019s consideration of the \ncase.  But to the extent the Court prefers respondents\u2019 formulation, \nit should grant certiorari on both of respondents\u2019 questions pre-\nsented to ensure that both the Appointments Clause and severabil-\nity issues are properly before the Court.       \n\n4 \n \n1. Task Force members are inferior officers because \nthe Secretary may remove them at will; and to the ex-\ntent further means of secretarial oversight were re-\nquired, the Secretary also has the authority to \u201csuper-\nvis[e] and direct[]\u201d the Public Health Service, 42 U.S.C. \n202, which includes the Task Force.  See also Reorgan-\nization Plan No. 3 of 1966 (Reorganization Plan), \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), \n2, 80 Stat. 1610.  Respondents do not dispute that the \nSecretary may remove Task Force members at will.  \nNor do they cite any case in which an official who was \nremovable at will by a principal officer was herself a \nprincipal officer.  Instead, they seek to downplay (Br. in \nSupport of Cert. 27) removability as \u201cmerely one factor\u201d \nin the inferior-officer analysis.  But even the Fifth Cir-\ncuit recognized that \u201can officer\u2019s removability\u201d is \u201cthe \nmost important\u201d \u201challmark[] of inferiority.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  And beyond removability, respondents entirely ig-\nnore the Secretary\u2019s additional express authority to su-\npervise and direct the Public Health Service. \nRespondents contend (Br. in Support of Cert. 27) \nthat Task Force members\u2019 recommendations are \u201cnot \nsubject to review or reversal\u201d by the HHS Secretary \nbecause 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(6) requires that those rec-\nommendations \u201cbe independent and, to the extent prac-\nticable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d  As the certi-\norari petition explains (at 19-20), however, the statutory \nreference to independence and freedom from political \npressure simply requires that Task Force members \nmake unbiased and evidence-based recommendations, \neven while those recommendations remain subject to \nsecretarial review.  Respondents do not explain why such \na scheme is unconstitutional\u2014particularly given that \nadministrative law judges and immigration judges, who \noperate under similar structures and exercise their \n\n5 \n \nindependent judgment, properly serve as inferior offic-\ners.  Pet. 20.     \nRespondents also insist (Br. in Support of Cert. 31) \nthat Task Force members must be principal officers be-\ncause the Secretary cannot \u201cdirect\u201d their recommenda-\ntions in the first instance.  That argument cannot be \nsquared with Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651 \n(1997), where this Court held that judges of the Coast \nGuard Court of Criminal Appeals were inferior officers \neven though no superior could \u201cattempt to influence (by \nthreat of removal or otherwise) the outcome of individ-\nual proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 664.  \u201cWhat [wa]s significant\u201d \nin Edmond\u2014and what is significant here\u2014was that the \nofficials at issue had \u201cno power to render a final decision \non behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so \nby\u201d a principal officer.  Id. at 665.  Cf. Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52, 135 (1926) (explaining that while \n\u201cthe President can not in a particular case properly in-\nfluence or control\u201d certain \u201cquasi judicial\u201d decisions of \nexecutive officers, \u201che may consider the decision after \nits rendition as a reason for removing the officer\u201d).       \n \nRespondents further argue (Br. in Support of Cert. \n29) that even if the government\u2019s interpretation of Sec-\ntion 299b-4(a)(6) is correct, an Appointments Clause \nproblem still exists because \u201cCongress has not \u2018vested\u2019 \nSecretary Becerra with appointment authority over the \nTask Force.\u201d  The Fifth Circuit did not embrace that \nargument, and for good reason.  Multiple statutory pro-\nvisions empower the Secretary to appoint Task Force \nmembers.  First, the Secretary may appoint Task Force \nmembers when \u201cacting through the Director\u201d of the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), \n42 U.S.C. 299(a), who normally convenes the Task \nForce, 42 U.S.C. 299b-4(a)(1).  See United States v. \n\n6 \n \nHartwell, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 385, 393-394 (1868) (holding \nthat a similar statutory provision properly vested ap-\npointment authority in a principal officer).  Second, the \nSecretary may appoint Task Force members when per-\nforming \u201call functions of the Public Health Service\u201d and \nits \u201cofficers\u201d\u2014including the AHRQ Director\u2014and when \n\u201cmak[ing] such provisions as he shall deem appropriate \nauthorizing the performance of any of the functions  \n* * *  of the Public Health Service.\u201d  Reorganization \nPlan, \u00a7\u00a7 1(a), 2, 80 Stat. 1610.  And even if the Secre-\ntary\u2019s appointment authority were ambiguous, this \nCourt should adopt the government\u2019s \u201creasonable inter-\npretation\u201d recognizing such authority over respond-\nents\u2019 suggestion that Congress impermissibly and con-\nclusively vested appointment authority of inferior offic-\ners (Task Force members) in a different inferior officer \n(the AHRQ Director).  Edmond, 520 U.S. at 658; see \nibid. (applying the constitutional-avoidance canon to \nhold that Congress vested appointment of inferior offic-\ners in a principal officer).     \n2. Assuming this Court were to conclude that Task \nForce members are unconstitutionally insulated from \nsecretarial direction and supervision, it should sever \nSection 299b-4(a)(6) to cure the constitutional defect.  \nThat approach follows directly from this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1 (2021).  See \nPet. 22-27.  Respondents hardly grapple with Arthrex\u2014\nlet alone show why its logic should not control the sev-\nerability analysis here.   \nInstead, respondents argue (Br. in Support of Cert. \n33) that severing Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not cure \nthe constitutional defect because the Secretary would \nstill lack the \u201cability to review or countermand [the \nTask Force\u2019s] decisions not to adopt an \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 \n\n7 \n \nrecommendation.\u201d  But the Secretary\u2019s lack of review \nover Task Force inaction does not violate the Constitu-\ntion.  If the Task Force determines that an item or ser-\nvice should not receive an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating, then no \nhealth plan is required to cover it under 42 U.S.C. \n300gg-13(a)(1), and there is thus no exercise of federal \nauthority over any private party.   \nFinally, respondents object (Br. in Support of Cert. \n33-34) to the entire enterprise of severability.  But this \nCourt has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c\u200a\u2018when confront-\ning a constitutional flaw in a statute, [it] tr[ies] to limit \nthe solution to the problem\u2019 by disregarding the \u2018prob-\nlematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 23 (quoting Ayotte v. Planned \nParenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 328-329 \n(2006)).  And the Court has consistently applied that ap-\nproach in separation of powers cases after identifying a \nconstitutional defect.  See id. at 23-27; Seila Law LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 234-238 (2020) (plurality opin-\nion); Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Over-\nsight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 508-510 (2010).  To the extent \nthe Court believes that the Task Force\u2019s current struc-\nture is unconstitutional, it should follow the same course \nhere.2   \n \n \n2 Respondents briefly suggest (Br. in Support of Cert. 34) that \nsevering Section 299b-4(a)(6) would not \u201credress [their] Article III \ninjuries.\u201d  But the Court should adhere to its normal practice of find-\ning the defective provision severable and then remanding for con-\nsideration of the proper relief (if any) that should be provided to the \nplaintiffs.  See Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 259-260 (2021); Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 238 (plurality opinion); Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. \nat 514.   \n\n8 \n \n* * * * * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the pe-\ntition for a writ of certiorari, the Court should grant the \npetition. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, Pub. L. No. 111\u2013148, 124 Stat. 119, health \ninsurance issuers and group health plans must cover \ncertain preventive services recommended by the Task \nForce without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on \npatients. 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13(a)(1). The question presented \nis as follows:\nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nthe structure of the Task Force violates the Appointments \nClause, U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7\u00a02, Cl. 2, and in declining \nto sever the statutory provision that it found to unduly \ninsulate the Task Force from the HHS Secretary\u2019s \nsupervision.\n\nii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nQUESTION PRESENTED .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nTABLE OF CONTENTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . iv\nIDENTITY AND INTEREST OF AMICUS \n\t\nCURIAE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \n\t\nARGUMENT  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\nARGUMENT .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nI. \t The inferior / superior distinction does \nnot turn exclusively on an officer\u2019s \n\t\nremovability  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nA. \t The distinction depends on \u201cwhere \nthe buck stops,\u201d not on removability \n\t\nalone .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5\nB. \t The Court should not make removability \n\t\nthe dispositive consideration .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . 10\nII. \t The \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d clause \n\t\ncannot salvage the statute .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . 12\n\niii\nTable of Contents\nPage\nIII. \tThe policy arguments of the medical \namici cannot overcome the constitutional \n\t\nmandate .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\nCONCLUSION .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\niv\nTABLE OF CITED AUTHORITIES\nPage\nCases\nBiden v.

Among the most familiar is \nthe separation of governmental powers into legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches. Less apparent, but \nequally important, are provisions such as the Appointments \nClause, which helps implement the separation of powers \nprinciple by ensuring that legislative and executive \nauthority are not exercised by the same people, let alone \nby people insulated from democratic accountability. At its \ncore, \u201cthe principle of separation of powers is embedded \nin the Appointments Clause.\u201d Freytag v. C.I.R., 501 U.S. \n868, 882 (1991).\nUnfortunately, Congress has a strong incentive to \nfind ways to give away its power\u2014and therefore, its \nresponsibility\u2014to officials or agencies that are shielded \nfrom voter control. And when Congress enacted, and \nPresident Obama signed, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), they left much work to be \ndone by executive agencies, including the creation of rules \ngoverning insurance coverage for preventive healthcare \nservices and the assignment of financial responsibility for \n3.\u2002 https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA700.\npdf.\n\n3\nthose services. Congress entrusted these questions to the \nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force (\u201cPSTF\u201d \nor \u201cTask Force\u201d), a group of unelected subject matter \nexperts whose independence from political pressure \nwas to be secured \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0299b-4(a)(6).\nCongress created the PSTF in 1984 as a panel of \nmedical specialty authorities with technical expertise \nin disease prevention. The Task Force works to \nimprove the public\u2019s health by making evidence-based \nrecommendations about clinical preventive services.4 It \nwas given no inherent authority. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299b-4(a). \nNevertheless, Section 2713 of the ACA requires private \ninsurers to cover the cost of all preventive services for \nwhich the Task Force assigns a grade of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d \n(meaning a high certainty that the net benefit is either \nsubstantial or moderate). Such services must be paid for \nby insurers with no cost-sharing (i.e., no deductibles or \nco-payments).5 In other words, the ACA transformed what \nhad previously been a powerless advisory body, created to \nmake recommendations based on its members\u2019 technical \nexpertise, into a government agency with law-making \npowers.\nBut the Constitution\u2014and specifically, the \nAppointments Clause\u2014forbids the government from \ngiving such authority to people who are not \u201caccountable \nto political force and the will of the people.\u201d Freytag, 501 \nU.S. at 884.\n4.\u2002 https://tinyurl.com/3a9ajkb9.\n5.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nus-preventive-services-task-force-ratings.\n\n4\nAt issue here is whether members of the PSTF \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be \nappointed through the Senate-confirmation process, or \nwhether they are \u201cinferior\u201d officers whose appointment \nCongress can entrust to the President alone, or to the \nheads of departments. U.S. Const. art. II \u00a7\u00a02. For many \nyears this Court has used a functional test to distinguish \nbetween superior and inferior officers. This test involved \nseveral factors including the degree of discretion the \nofficers exercise, the content of the work they do, and \ntheir removability. But the government here takes a \nformalistic approach to the question, arguing that officials \nwhose dictates are ipso facto the law of the land are not \nofficers of the United States, based exclusively on the fact \nthat they are removable by the Secretary. That, however, \nis contrary to the realistic or functional approach this \nCourt has taken for more than a century. The fact that \nan official is removable at will cannot alone determine the \n\u201csuperior\u201d / \u201cinferior\u201d classification. Instead, the scope of \nthat officer\u2019s powers is also an important factor.\nWhat\u2019s more, the whole purpose of the Task Force \nis to exercise independent judgment. It is logically \ncontradictory to assert that the Task Force is independent \nand unsupervised, but also subject to the political \nprocess through the Secretary. Yet that is in substance \nthe government\u2019s argument, when it contends that the \nphrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d in the ACA (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0 299b-4(a)(6)) cures the constitutional violation by \nincorporating the requirements of checks and balances \ninto the PSTF\u2019s structure. See, e.g., Pet. at 21. To interpret \nthe statute that way is to rob the Task Force of its very \nreason for being. The government cannot have it both \nways.\n\n5\nFinally, numerous medical group amici argued \nbelow that significant benefits to public health are at \nstake in this case. Certainly, improving public health is \na core purpose for the PSTF and the preventive health \nservice recommendations, and those amici are right that \nthe PSTF\u2019s work affects preventive healthcare services \nfor millions of Americans. \u201cBut this argument, which \nboils down to a policy judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot vitiate the \nconstitutional allocation of powers.\u201d Perez v. Mortg. \nBankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 132\u201333 (2015) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring). Such arguments are properly addressed \nto Congress, to persuade it to restructure the PSTF in \na constitutional manner. They cannot, however, justify \ndiverting from the Constitution\u2019s mandates.\nARGUMENT\nI. \t The inferior / superior distinction does not turn \nexclusively on an officer\u2019s removability.\nA. \t The distinction depends on \u201cwhere the buck \nstops,\u201d not on removability alone.\nThe Appointments Clause requires Senate \nconfirmation for principal officers of the United States, \nsuch as diplomats and judges, but lets Congress give the \nresponsibility of appointing \u201cinferior officers\u201d (of which \nthe text provides no examples) to the President, or to the \nheads of departments, or to the courts alone. U.S. Const. \nart. II \u00a7\u00a02.\nThe original meaning of \u201cofficers\u201d included any \nperson with significant responsibility for enforcing \nstatutory duties. Jennifer Mascott, Who Are \u201cOfficers of \n\n6\nthe United States\u201d? 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, 471\u2013545 (2018). \nThis included even government employees engaged in \nministerial tasks. The distinction between \u201cprincipal\u201d and \n\u201cinferior,\u201d meanwhile, has long turned on the substance \nof that person\u2019s responsibilities. For example, in United \nStates v. Germaine, 99 U.S. (9 Otto) 508, 511\u201312 (1878), \nthis Court described the difference between principal and \ninferior officers by reference to their \u201ctenure, duration, \nemolument, and duties.\u201d\nA century later, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), \nreiterated the Court\u2019s substantive or functional approach \nto distinguishing inferior from principal when it held \nthat commissioners of the Federal Election Commission \n(FEC) were not constitutionally appointed. It said that \nthe question turned on whether the purported officer was \n\u201cexercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Id. at 126.\nSome cases have used a more formalistic analysis, \nhowever, suggesting that the decisive factor in \ndetermining whether an officer is inferior or superior is \nremovability. This has caused considerable confusion. See \nDamien M. Schiff & Oliver J. Dunford, Distinguishing \nBetween Inferior and Non-Inferior Officers Under the \nAppointments Clause\u2014A Question of \u201cSignificance,\u201d 74 \nRutgers U.L. Rev. 469, 506\u201307 (2022).\nFree Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010), for example, rightly \nwarned of the danger that \u201cthe Executive Branch, which \nnow wields vast power and touches almost every aspect \nof daily life, .\u00a0.\u00a0. may slip from the Executive\u2019s control, \nand thus from that of the people,\u201d id. at 499, but it \n\n7\ndecided the inferior/principal question based exclusively \non removability. Id. at 495\u201396. And Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651 (1997), seemingly treated removability \nthe only relevant factor\u2014declaring, for example, that \n\u201c[w]hether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether \nhe has a superior.\u201d Id. at 662. Although Justice Souter \nhastened to add that \u201c[i]t does not follow .\u00a0.\u00a0. that if one is \nsubject to some supervision and control, one is an inferior \nofficer,\u201d no other justice joined his opinion. Id. at 667 \n(Souter, J., concurring).\nMore recently, however, the Court has appeared to \nreturn to the more holistic approach recommended in \nBuckley\u2014one that views removability not as decisive \nbut only indicative. Thus, United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1 (2021), answered the question of whether the \nAdministrative Patent Judges (APJ) serving on the Patent \nTrial and Appeal Board (PTAB) were inferior or principal \nofficers by considering factors besides mere removability. \nInstead, the question was whether the decisions of APJs \nwere subject to review by the Director. Id. at 26. This \nCourt said that \u201cregardless [of] whether the Government \nis correct that at-will removal by the Secretary would cure \nthe constitutional problem, review by the Director better \nreflects the structure of supervision within the PTO and \nthe nature of APJs\u2019 duties.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\nThe lower court in Arthrex had declared that it was \nenough to declare the tenure provision of the act at issue \nunconstitutional, but this Court held otherwise. Mere \nremovability, it said, gave the Director no \u201cmeans of \ncountermanding the final decision already on the books.\u201d \nId. at 16. That meant that \u201c[i]n all the ways that matter to \nthe parties who appear before the PTAB, the buck stops \n\n8\nwith the APJs, not with the Secretary or Director.\u201d Id. \nat 17.\nThe same is true, of course, of the PSTF. Its \nmembers are appointed by the Secretary to four-year \nterms. New members are selected each year to replace \nthose completing their terms. Thus, although individual \nappointments are time-limited, the duties of the 16 \nmembers of the Task Force are continuing and ongoing.6 \nAnd their decisions are where the buck stops. Section 2713 \nof the ACA, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13 and embodied in \nregulation at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a02590.715\u20132713(a)(1)(i), mandates \nthat group health plans and health insurers offer group \nhealth insurance, provide coverage, and not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements for, items and services having \nan \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d rating in current recommendations of the \nPSTF.\nBut the PSTF\u2019s structure is even more defiant of the \nconstitutional order than was the PTAB in Arthrex. As the \ncourt below observed, the PSTF is \u201cnot part of HHS or any \nfederal agency,\u201d and therefore the decisions of its members \nare not automatically subject to secretarial oversight. Pet. \nApp. 81a. So, even more than in Arthrex, the buck stops \nnot with an official who is subject to Senate confirmation, \nbut with the \u201cvolunteers\u201d who serve on PSTF.\nNot only are the decisions of the PSTF members \neffectively final, but the nature and scope of those \ndecisions is significant. Since at least Germaine, and \ncertainly since Buckley, this Court has found that one \n6.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nabout-uspstf/current-members.\n\n9\nfactor in determining who is a superior or inferior officer \nis the substantive effect of that person\u2019s discretionary \nauthority. \u201cLesser functionaries\u201d carrying out minor \ntasks may not qualify, but anyone entrusted to \u201cexercis[e] \nsignificant authority pursuant to the laws\u201d is likely a \nprincipal officer. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126 & n.162. Arthrex \nrightly recognized that removability is not dispositive; the \nsubstantive impact of the officer\u2019s decision-making power \nis also key. Thus \u201ceven when a higher-ranking officer has \nsubstantial direction and supervision over other officers \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the latter are not inferior officers if they exercise \nsignificant authority\u2014most prominently, final decision-\nmaking authority\u2014on behalf of the Executive Branch.\u201d \nSchiff & Dunford, supra at 513.\nThe most recent list of recommendations includes 14 \nservices rated \u201cA\u201d and 40 rated \u201cB.\u201d7 According to a 2022 \nreport from the HHS Assistant Secretary for Planning \nand Evaluation, 150 million people with private health \ninsurance can receive these preventive services without \ncost-sharing. Access to Preventive Services without Cost-\nSharing: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act (ASPE \nOffice of Health Policy Brief HP-2022-01, Jan. 11, 2022) \nat 1.8 The Task Force\u2019s ability to order health insurers to \ncover the cost, without cost-sharing, of over 50 preventive \nhealth services for nearly half the country\u2019s population is \ncertainly a significant power. And the fact that Congress \nexpressly designed the Task Force to be independent\u2014\nmandating that it \u201cshall be independent,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a0299b-4(a)(6)\u2014means that its members exercise their \n7.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nrecommendation-topics/uspstf-a-and-b-recommendations. \n8.\u2002 https://tinyurl.com/38vdp3r4.\n\n10\nauthority without meaningful oversight by responsible, \nSenate-confirmed superiors. On these issues, the buck \nstops with them.\nB. \t The Court should not make removability the \ndispositive consideration.\nIn Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237 (2018), this Court \nconsidered whether administrative law judges (ALJs) \nwith career appointments, chosen by the staff of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), were \nofficers who must be appointed in accordance with the \nAppointment Clause. Once again, the Court employed a \nfunctionalist, multi-factor analysis, not a formalistic test \nbased solely on removability. Echoing the significant-\nauthority test from Buckley, it said that ALJs not only \n\u201c[held] a continuing office established by law,\u201d but that \nthey also \u201cexercise .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . \u2019significant discretion\u2019 when \ncarrying out .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u2019important functions.\u2019\u201d Id. at 247\u201348 \n(quoting Freytag, 501 U.S. at 878). Specifically, the ALJs \ncould receive evidence, examine witnesses, and regulate \nthe course of proceedings and the behavior of counsel, \ndecide motions, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and \neven enforce compliance with discovery orders. Id. at \n248. Their \u201cduties and powers\u201d were therefore significant \nenough that, combined with other considerations, they \nwere officers of the United States who must go through \nSenate confirmation. Id.\nThis consideration of the substantive duties and \npowers of the officer, rather than a single-minded focus \non removability, is crucial for at least three reasons. \nFirst, an officer who is theoretically removable may be \neffectively unremovable due to various circumstances. \n\n11\nTo make removability the determinative factor would \nenable Congress to vest officials with immense powers \nand to insulate them from any meaningful oversight by \nincluding some provision for removability that is nothing \nbut window-dressing.\nSecond, the powers an official exercises may be wide \nand various, and that official may be the final decision-\nmaker on many matters\u2014but still be removable by an \nofficial whose authority is not \u201csuperior\u201d on those subjects. \nBy analogy, a police chief might be \u201cremovable\u201d by the \ncity council, but nevertheless be the ultimate authority \nin charge of running the police department; the city \ncouncil\u2019s binary choice whether to remove her does not \nnecessarily imply any real control over her decisions as \nlong as she remains chief. Thus, despite the fact that the \nchief is removable by the council, she remains the point \nat which \u201cthe buck stops\u201d for all practical purposes\u2014and \nis thus a principal officer.\nThird, and relatedly, merely removing an official has \nonly prospective effects; it does not nullify decisions that \nthe official made before being removed. Thus, even if the \nSecretary were to remove Task Force members, neither \nhe nor the President has any power to override or modify \nthe Task Force\u2019s work: i.e., its mandates to insurers to \ncover certain preventive care services. All they could \ndo is hope that those members\u2019 replacements are more \naligned with their own policy views. But that is not control \nor accountability in any meaningful sense.\nThe government has argued in this case that \n\u201cremovability of an officer\u201d is \u201cstrong and likely dispositive \nevidence of inferior-officer status.\u201d Pet. at 15. But such \n\n12\na myopic analysis would overlook situations in which an \nofficer (like the police chief) has authority over a range of \naction and is, in fact, the ultimate decision-maker, due to \nthe theoretical removability of that official. It would also \nmake it impossible to decide cases in which an agency is \nstructured to establish some illusory form of removability \nmerely to evade the constitutional mandate. Because the \nConstitution deals with substance, not shadows\u2014with \nthings, not names, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. \nv. President & Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, \n230 (2023)\u2014that cannot be the rule.\nII. \tThe \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d clause cannot \nsalvage the statute.\nThe statute reads, \u201c[all] members of the Task Force \nconvened under this subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent and, to the \nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0299b-4(a)(6). In the courts below, the government \nhas tried to use the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d \nto salvage the statute\u2019s constitutionality. It has argued \nthat the phrase applies both to the word that precedes \nit (\u201cindependent\u201d), and to the phrase that follows it \n(\u201cnot subject to political pressure\u201d). The government \nasserts that this bi-directional application of the phrase \nwould result in the Secretary having sufficient approval \nauthority over the Task Force recommendations as well \nas the removal and reorganization of the PSTF itself. \nBy that reading, the Task Force is not independent, and \ntherefore no issue with the Appointments Clause exists.\nThat reading of the phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d \nis ungrammatical, nonsensical, and inconsistent with the \ncanons of statutory construction.\n\n13\nFirst, it is ungrammatical. The ordinary speaker of \nEnglish would express the government\u2019s version of this \nphrase as \u201cto the extent practicable, shall be independent \nand not subject to political pressure.\u201d But that is \nmanifestly not what the statute says. The statute applies \nthe qualifier only after the word \u201cand\u201d and a comma: \n\u201cshall be independent and, to the extent practicable, \nnot subject to political pressure.\u201d This word and comma \nwould play no role in the statute under the government\u2019s \nreading. But of course, in construing statutes, courts \u201cgive \neffect, if possible, to every word Congress used,\u201d Reiter \nv. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979), and \u201cheed \nthe commands of [the statute\u2019s] punctuation.\u201d U.S. Nat. \nBank of Oregon v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 \nU.S. 439, 454 (1993). Congress\u2019 use of terms connected by \na conjunction and comma indicates the establishment of \ntwo distinct requirements for the PSTF. Congress meant \nfor the members of the PSTF and their recommendations \nfirst to be \u201cindependent,\u201d and then, second and separately, \nto be not subject to political influence \u201cto the extent \npracticable.\u201d\nOver 100 provisions of the U.S. Code use the phrase \n\u201cand to the extent practicable,\u201d and in every one of these \ninstances, the qualifier is understood only to apply to what \nfollows, not what precedes. To cite just three examples:\n\u2022 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06448(a)(1), which requires the president \nto publish certain matters in the Federal Register, \nrequires publication of \u201c[a]ny designation of a country of \nparticular concern for religious freedom under section \n6442(b)(1) of this title, together with, when applicable and \nto the extent practicable, the identities of the officials or \nentities determined to be responsible for the violations \n\n14\nunder section 6442(b)(2) of this title\u201d (emphasis added). \nHere, the qualifier applies only to the publication of the \nidentities of officials or entities\u2014not to the designation of \na country of particular concern, which must be published \nin any event.\n\u2022 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a06318(b)(1), which requires that certain \nschool policies be given to parents in writing, says: \u201cParents \nshall be notified of the policy in an understandable and \nuniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided \nin a language the parents can understand\u201d (emphasis \nadded). Plainly the practicability qualifier applies only to \nthe language requirement\u2014whereas the requirements \nof understandability and uniformity apply to every case \nwithout any such qualification.\n\u2022 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 1256(e)(1), which governs grants \nfor certain pollution control programs, prohibits the \nAdministrator of the EPA from giving such grants \nto states that fail to implement certain monitoring \nprocedures. It bars funding if a state fails to provide for \n\u201cthe establishment and operation of appropriate devices, \nmethods, systems, and procedures necessary to monitor \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. the quality of navigable waters and to the extent \npracticable, ground waters including biological monitoring \n.\u00a0.\u00a0. .\u201d (emphasis added). Once again, the qualifier plainly \napplies only to the groundwater monitoring. It does not \napply to the navigable-water monitoring, which is required \nin all events, not just when practicable.\nIn other words, it appears that \u201cand to the extent \npracticable\u201d is never used in the U.S. Code in the \nbidirectional manner that the government proposes here.\n\n15\nNot only is the government\u2019s reading ungrammatical; \nit is also nonsensical. The statute attempts to preserve \nboth the PSTF\u2019s independence and its immunity \nfrom political pressure. Laying aside the question of \nwhether the second goal is legitimate at all, these are \ntwo significantly different things. The Task Force\u2019s \nmembers are supposed to be experts who exercise their \n\u201cindependent\u201d judgment. But the \u201cindependent\u201d judgment \nof any experts will be based in a significant measure \non outside recommendations, analysis, arguments, \netc.\u2014everything from advocacy by interested parties to \npublications in peer-reviewed medical literature. That \nis just what \u201cindependent\u201d judgment means. By way of \nanalogy, a judge exercises her \u201cindependent\u201d judgment \neven though she reads the parties\u2019 briefs and listens to \ntheir advocacy. These are types of influences (or, so to \nspeak, \u201cpressures\u201d) that Congress expected to be brought \nto bear on the PSTF members, and to which it had no \nobjection.\nPolitical influence, by contrast, it sought to avoid. \nAgain, aside from the question of whether such insulation \nis proper, Congress implicitly acknowledged that some \nexternal influences, with an array of motivations and on a \nbroad spectrum of scientific objectivity, play an appropriate \nrole in affecting the PSTF\u2019s recommendations\u2014but that \nother influences (namely, \u201cpolitical\u201d influences) should not. \nThe Task Force should be \u201cindependent\u201d in the sense \nof listening to certain types of arguments (presumably, \nscientific ones)\u2014but, separately, it should not listen to, or \nbe forced to listen to, other types of argument (namely, \n\u201cpolitical\u201d ones).\n\n16\nThat understanding is incompatible with the \ngovernment\u2019s proposed reading of the statute. Its \nreading would transform the phrase into: \u201cto the extent \npracticable, shall be independent .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d etc. But Congress \ndid not want the PSTF to be independent (i.e., to exercise \nscientific objectivity) only \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d \nIt wanted the PSTF to do so in all events. It would be \nnonsensical to suggest that Congress wanted the PSTF \nto compromise its scientific independence to any degree. \nThat, however, is the result to which the government\u2019s \ngrammar would lead.\nCongress applied common rules of grammar when it \nplaced that qualifying phrase \u201cto the extent practicable\u201d \nprior to \u201cnot subject to political pressure.\u201d It sought only \nto modify what came after the qualifier and not what \ncame before.\nFurther evidence for this reading comes from the \nplacement of the word \u201cshall.\u201d Its location in the text \nimmediately before specifying the independence of the \nTask Force indicates mandatory intent on the part of the \ndrafters. The phrase reads: \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \nThus, the independence provision is mandatory\u2014whereas \nthe qualifying phrase merely expresses a directional and \naspirational goal.\nAll of this makes sense in a broader perspective, too. \nThe entire point of the PSTF statute is to render that Task \nForce as autonomous as possible. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0299b-4. \nAs used in the statute, \u201cindependent\u201d means not subject \nto control, restriction, modification or limitation from an \noutside source. From its inception, the statute provided \n\n17\nthat the members of the PSTF would establish their own \nrecommendations.\nThe whole point of the Task Force is to act without \npolitical oversight or control. Its members reach a \ncollective decision on those recommendations based upon \ntheir subject matter expertise as healthcare professionals. \nThey are not required by statute to seek the opinion, \ncounsel or guidance of others. The work they produce is \nnot subject to appeal or review. The Task Force precisely \nembodies Congress\u2019s choice to adopt a technocratic \napproach whereby \u201cexperts\u201d oversee the operation of \npublic health without effective public control.\nWhat one scholar said of Medicare applies equally \nhere: \u201ca hidden rationing problem has developed where \nMedicare considers the cost of new treatments when \ndeciding whether to cover them, but does so in an \nundemocratic way that is not transparent nor subject to \ndirect public response.\u201d Jacqueline Fox, The Hidden Role \nof Cost: Medicare Decisions, Transparency and Public \nTrust, 79 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1, 4 (2010). It is no secret that \nthe ACA was the product of a \u201cbelief that bureaucrats \nmight more effectively govern the country than the \nAmerican people.\u201d Perez, 575 U.S. at 129 n.6 (Thomas, \nJ., concurring).\nThe government has posited that although Task \nForce members are independent, they are protected from \npolitical influence only \u201cto the extent practicable,\u201d and that \nthis phrase makes them subordinate to the Secretary\u2014\ntherefore, there is no issue with the Appointments Clause. \nBut as the court below held, such a reading would allow \nthe exception to \u201cswallow the rule.\u201d Pet. App. 106a.\n\n18\nPerhaps more importantly, it would also nullify \nthe mandate that the PSTF be independent. The Task \nForce simply cannot be \u201cindependent\u201d while at the same \ntime being subject to management at the hands of the \nSecretary. The government cannot have it both ways.\nIII. The policy arguments of the medical amici cannot \novercome the constitutional mandate.\nIn their amicus brief to the Fifth Circuit, 28 \nmedical groups argued that the circuit court\u2019s ruling \nwould jeopardize access to, and coverage of, preventive \nhealthcare services for millions, and potentially threaten \npositive trends in public health. To be sure, these amici \nare subject-matter experts who know firsthand the value \nof preventive health services. Their daily work revolves \naround making it possible for patients to live longer and \nhealthier lives.\nAmici explained that preventive services include \nthose aimed at early detection and treatment and those \nthat encourage healthier lifestyles.9 Indeed, preventive \nhealthcare services \u201cavoid acute illness, identify and \ntreat chronic conditions, prevent cancer or lead to earlier \ndetection.\u201d Access to Preventive Services without Cost-\nSharing: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act, U.S. \nDep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs. at 1 (Jan. 11, 2022).10 \n\u201cWhen provided appropriately, these services can identify \ndiseases at earlier stages when they are more treatable \n9.\u2002 Brief Amicus Curiae of AMA, et al. (Doc. 204-2), Section \n1, at 6, 18.\n10.\u2002 https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/786fa\n55a84e7e3833961933124d70dd2/preventive-services-ib-2022.pdf.\n\n19\nor may reduce a person\u2019s risk for developing a disease.\u201d \nEleventh Annual Report to Congress on High-Priority \nEvidence Gaps for Clinical Preventive Services, 5 (U.S. \nPreventive Servs. Task Force 2021).11 Therefore, it is \nnot surprising that preventive services reduce overall \nspending on healthcare because they \u201creduce the amount \nof undiagnosed or untreated conditions,\u201d making less \ninvasive treatment an option. Robert Brent Dixon & Attila \nJ. Hertelendy, Interrelation of Preventive Care Benefits \n& Shared Costs Under the Affordable Care Act, 3 Int\u2019l J. \nHealth Pol\u2019y & Mgmt. 145, 146 (2014).12\nThe full measure of benefits from preventive health \nservices can only be achieved if patients receive those \nservices. Unfortunately, it is also true that the costs \nassociated with receiving preventive services may impair \nthe public\u2019s ability to access care. Amanda Borsky, et al., \nFew Americans Receive All High-Priority, Appropriate \nClinical Preventive Services, 37 Health Affs. 925, 927 \n(2018). Indeed, it is well documented \u201cthat out-of-pocket \npayments can be a barrier to the use of recommended \npreventive services, and reductions in cost sharing were \nfound to be associated with increased use of preventive \nservices.\u201d Christine Leopold, et al., The Impact of the \nAffordable Care Act on Cancer Survivorship, 23 Cancer \nJ. 181, 184 (2017).\n11.\u2002 https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/\nsites/default/files/inline-files/2021-uspstf-annual-report-to-\ncongress.pdf.\n12.\u2002 https://www.ijhpm.com/article_2873_82e924a0ee21074a\n1a60025d3990d1d4.pdf.\n\n20\nThe medical group amici are right about this. But \nnone of it changes the mandates of the Constitution. \nThe Appointments Clause exists for good reason: to \nensure that the people are governed by officials who are \nmeaningfully answerable to the public. Cf. Nat\u2019l Fed. of \nIndep. Bus. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 126 (2022) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cThe question before us is not \nhow to respond to the pandemic, but who holds the power \nto do so..\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [W]e do not impugn the intentions behind the \nagency\u2019s mandate. Instead, we only discharge our duty to \nenforce the law\u2019s demands when it comes to the question \nwho may govern the lives of 84 million Americans.\u201d). Every \ngeneration is tempted by the notion that if government \npower were given over to an individual or group who is \nmade immune from \u201cpolitical pressure,\u201d such \u201cexperts\u201d \ncan solve political problems \u201ccorrectly\u201d or \u201cobjectively\u201d\u2014\nwhatever that might mean. For example, one prominent \nadvocate of the ACA defended its creation of undemocratic \nadministrative agencies like the PSTF on the grounds that \nthey could serve as \u201cthe Platonic Guardian[s] of our health \ncare system.\u201d Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, The Independent \nMedicare Advisory Board, 11 Yale J. Health Pol\u2019y, L. & \nEthics 21, 31 (2011).13 But this is always a utopian delusion, \nwith potentially disastrous consequences.\nFirst, the Constitution\u2019s authors expressly rejected \nany notion of \u201cPlatonic guardians.\u201d Indeed, they spurned \nthe idea of being governed by \u201ca will in the community \n13.\u2002 Jost was referring to the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard (IPAB), another agency created in the ACA and given \npower to limit expenditures for certain treatments\u2014while being \neffectively protected from any Congressional control. See Coons v. \nLew, 762 F.3d 891, 895\u201396 (9th Cir. 2014). In all relevant respects, \nit is similar to the PSTF.\n\n21\nindependent of the majority,\u201d because such an independent \nentity could impose \u201cunjust\u201d legislation without any \ncheck by the people. The Federalist No. 51, at 351 (James \nMadison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961).14 As Thomas \nJefferson said, \u201cSometimes it is said that man can not be \ntrusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be \ntrusted with the government of others? Or have we found \nangels in the forms of kings to govern him?\u201d Jefferson: \nWritings 493 (Merrill Peterson, ed., 1984).\nSecond, the idea that any government entity will be \nimmune from political pressures is fantastical. As scholars \nin the \u201cpublic choice\u201d tradition have shown, any time a \ngovernment entity has authority to redistribute wealth or \nopportunities from one sector of the populace to another, \nthat power has an economic value, and pressure groups in \nthe society will therefore expend effort to obtain that value \n14.\u2002 Plato proposed that political power should reside \u201c[o]nly \nin the hands of the select few or of the enlightened individual,\u201d \nStatesman 297c, in Plato: The Collected Dialogues 1067 (Edith \nHamilton & Huntington Cairns eds., 1961), and thus imagined a \nsociety overseen by Guardians who would (among other things) \ngovern the \u201cart of medicine\u201d by laws which \u201cwill care for the \nbodies and souls of such of your citizens as are truly wellborn, but \nthose who are not, such as are defective in body, they will suffer \nto die, and those who are evil-natured and incurable in soul [the \nGuardians] will themselves put to death.\u201d Republic 409e\u2013410a, \nin id. at 654. \u201cThis,\u201d the argument goes, \u201chas been shown to be \nthe best thing for the sufferers themselves and for the state.\u201d Id. \nat 410a. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams called these ideas \n\u201cshock[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. disgust[ing]\u201d \u201cunintelligible .\u00a0.\u00a0. nonsense\u201d produced \nby a \u201cfoggy mind.\u201d Compare Letter from Jefferson to Adams, \nJuly 5, 1814, in The Adams-Jefferson Letters 432-33 (Lester J. \nCappon, ed., 1987), with Letter from Adams to Jefferson, July 16, \n1814, in id. at 437.\n\n22\nthrough lobbying of various kinds. See generally James \nBuchanan & Gordon Tullock, The Calculus of Consent \n(1962). As long as the government is run by human beings, \nand makes decisions that grant concentrated benefits \nto some particular beneficiaries, it will be subjected to \npolitical influences of one sort or another. Attempting \nto insulate it from public control only pushes political \ninfluence into the shadows, where it can be less guarded \nagainst.\nIn fact, the amici who warn that this Court\u2019s decision \nmay jeopardize millions of Americans\u2019 health aptly \nillustrate the Appointments Clause problem: the Task \nForce is made up of principal officers precisely to the extent \nit exercises significant power, as detailed in the preceding \nsections. To say otherwise\u2014that the Court should enforce \nthe separation of powers less scrupulously when doing \nso might have considerable effects in the real world\u2014\nwould eviscerate not only the Appointments Clause, but \nother safeguards, like the major questions doctrine. See, \ne.g., Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S.\u00a0Ct. 2355, 2374 (2023) (\u201cA \ndecision of such magnitude and consequence on a matter \nof earnest and profound debate across the country must \nrest with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to \na clear delegation from that representative body.\u201d (citation \nomitted, alterations adopted)).\nIn the particular case of preventative medicine, the \nrisks of undemocratic control might seem minor. But \nthe across-the-board prohibition on unaccountable rule \nimplemented by the principle of separation-of-powers \nand the requirements of the Appointments Clause was \nintended to prevent the establishment of precedents \n\n23\nthat could be used again in the future. As this Court \nobserved in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656 (1972), \n\u201cthe Constitution recognizes higher values than speed \nand efficiency. .\u00a0.\u00a0. [It was] designed to protect the fragile \nvalues of a vulnerable citizenry from the overbearing \nconcern for efficiency and efficacy that may characterize \npraiseworthy government officials no less, and perhaps \nmore, than mediocre ones.\u201d In any particular instance, \nit might seem easier or more effective to disregard \nthe constitutional rule. But if the difficulty of obeying \nthe Constitution were justification for ignoring it, then \n\u201cthe people may well despair of ever being able to set a \nboundary to the powers of the government.\u201d Oakley v. \nAspinwall, 3 N.Y. 547, 568 (1850).\nCONCLUSION\nClarity and actionable guidance are particularly \nimportant here precisely because of the effect on public \nhealth resulting from the \u201crecommendations\u201d\u2014i.e., \nmandates\u2014of the PSTF. Regardless of the medical \narguments, no policy argument can prevail over the \nrequirements of the Appointments Clause. The Court \nshould dismiss the tortured reading of the statutory text \nadvocated by the government and find that members of \nthe Task Force are principal officers. It should also make \nclear that the distinction between principal and inferior \nofficers turns not exclusively on removability, but also on \nthe substantive significance of the decisions falling within \ntheir authority.\n\n24\nThe judgment should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted, \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae Goldwater Institute\nTimothy Sandefur\nCounsel of Record\nJohn Thorpe\nScharf-Norton Center for \nConstitutional Litigation \nat the Goldwater Institute\n500 East Coronado Road\nPhoenix, AZ  85004\n(602) 462-5000\nlitigation@goldwaterinstitute.org",

It also empowers the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force to dictate and decree the preventive \ncare that private insurance must cover. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). A separate statute requires that the \nTask Force members and their preventive-care coverage \nedicts be \u201cindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \nThe court of appeals held that the Task Force mem-\nbers are \u201cprincipal officers\u201d who must be appointed by \nthe president with Senate confirmation. The court of ap-\npeals reached this conclusion because of the powers that \nthe Task Force wields under the Affordable Care Act, \nand because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) shields the Task \nForce from direction or supervision by others. And be-\ncause the Task Force members were not appointed in \nconformity with Article II, the court of appeals enjoined \nSecretary Becerra from enforcing the Task Force\u2019s pre-\nventive-care coverage mandates against the plaintiffs. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Did the court of appeals correctly hold that \nthe Task Force members are \u201cprincipal offic-\ners\u201d who must be appointed by the president \nwith Senate confirmation? \n2. Did the court of appeals correctly refuse the \ndefendants\u2019 request to \u201csever,\u201d i.e., nullify, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) and allow Secretary Be-\ncerra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s \npreventive-care coverage decisions? \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestions presented ............................................................. i \nTable of contents .................................................................. ii \nAppendix .............................................................................. iii \nTable of authorities ............................................................. iv \nOpinions below ....................................................................... 2 \nJurisdiction ............................................................................. 3 \nConstitutional and statutory provisions involved ............. 3 \nStatement ............................................................................... 3 \nI.

Pet. App. 1a\u201326a. And when \na lower court holds an Act of Congress unconstitutional, \nthis Court\u2019s usual practice is to grant certiorari without \nawaiting a circuit split\u2014especially when the contested \nlegislation is as significant as the Affordable Care Act. \nSee, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business \nv. Sebelius, 565 U.S. 1033 (2011); California v. Texas, 140 \nS. Ct. 1262 (2020); see also Pet. at 27\u201328 (citing authori-\n\n \n \n \n2\nties). The Solicitor General is also correct to observe that \na denial of certiorari will open the door for a new plaintiff \nto sue within the fifth circuit and obtain a nationwide \nremedy that will vacate all agency actions taken to im-\nplement the preventive-care coverage mandates recom-\nmended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nsince March 23, 2010. See Pet. at 30\u201331. The respondents \nbelieve that this Court should weigh in on the constitu-\ntionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appoint-\nments of the Task Force members before that happens. \nThe respondents disagree with the Solicitor Gen-\neral\u2019s criticisms of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, as well \nas her dire predictions of what might happen if the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling is allowed to stand. But none of those \ndisagreements affect the certworthiness of this case. The \npetition satisfies this Court\u2019s criteria for certiorari and \npresents an issue of exceptional importance. And there \nare no vehicle problems that might counsel in favor of \nwaiting for a different case. The Court should grant the \npetition. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals is reported at 104 \nF.4th 930 and reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201348a. The opin-\nions of the district court are reported at 666 F. Supp. 3d \n613 and 627 F. Supp. 3d 624 and reproduced at Pet. App. \n49a\u201384a and Pet. App. 85a\u2013136a.1 \n \n1. Throughout this brief, we will use \u201cPet. App.\u201d to refer to the \nappendix to the petition filed by the Solicitor General. We will \nuse \u201cApp.\u201d to refer to the appendix attached to the respondents\u2019 \nbrief in support of certiorari. \n\n \n \n \n3\nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on June \n21, 2024. The Solicitor General timely petitioned for cer-\ntiorari on September 19, 2024. This Court has jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nINVOLVED \nThe relevant constitutional and statutory provisions \nappear in the appendix to the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. \nPet. App. 137a\u2013143a. \nSTATEMENT \nThe Affordable Care Act requires most private \nhealth insurers to cover certain forms of preventive care \nwithout any cost-sharing arrangements such as deducti-\nbles, co-pays, or out-of-pocket expenses. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a) (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).2 The statute does \nnot specify or delineate the preventive care that private \ninsurers must cover. Instead, the statute delegates this \nauthority to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \n(the Task Force), the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-\ntion Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and \nServices Administration (HRSA)\u2014and it empowers \nthese bodies to unilaterally determine the \u201cpreventive \n \n2. The Affordable Care Act exempts \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans from \nthese preventive-care coverage requirement. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 18011; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140. Short-term limited-duration insur-\nance plans are also exempt from these coverage mandates. See \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Short-Term, Lim-\nited-Duration Insurance, 83 Fed. Reg. 38,212 (2018).  \n\n \n \n \n4\ncare\u201d that should be covered and impose their compulso-\nry-coverage edicts on private insurers. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13 (Pet. App. 142a\u2013143a).  \nSection 300gg-13(a) contains four subsections that \nconfer these powers on the Task Force, ACIP, and \nHRSA. The statute reads as follows:  \nA group health plan and a health insurance is-\nsuer offering group or individual health insur-\nance coverage shall, at a minimum provide cov-\nerage for and shall not impose any cost sharing \nrequirements for\u2014 \n(1) evidence-based items or services that have \nin effect a rating of \u2018\u2018A\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018B\u2019\u2019 in the current \nrecommendations of the United States Preven-\ntive Services Task Force; \n(2) immunizations that have in effect a recom-\nmendation from the Advisory Committee on \nImmunization Practices of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention with respect to \nthe individual involved; and3 \n(3) with respect to infants, children, and ado-\nlescents, evidence-informed preventive care \nand screenings provided for in the comprehen-\nsive guidelines supported by the Health Re-\nsources and Services Administration.4  \n \n3. So in original. The word \u201cand\u201d probably should not appear. \n4. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n5\n(4) with respect to women, such additional pre-\nventive care and screenings not described in \nparagraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by the Health Resources \nand Services Administration for purposes of \nthis paragraph.5 \n(5) for the purposes of this chapter, and for the \npurposes of any other provision of law, the cur-\nrent recommendations of the United States \nPreventive Service Task Force regarding \nbreast cancer screening, mammography, and \nprevention shall be considered the most cur-\nrent other than those issued in or around No-\nvember 2009. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a).  \nThe \u201crecommendations\u201d and \u201cguidelines\u201d issued by \nthe Task Force, ACIP, and HRSA do not immediately \ncompel private insurers to cover the relevant care or \nservices. Instead, the ACA requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish a \u201cminimum in-\nterval\u201d of at least one year between the issuance of a \n\u201crecommendation\u201d or \u201cguideline\u201d and the plan year in \nwhich it becomes binding on private insurers:  \n(1) In general \nThe Secretary shall establish a minimum in-\nterval between the date on which a recommen-\ndation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or \n \n5. So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon. \n\n \n \n \n6\na guideline under subsection (a)(3) is issued \nand the plan year with respect to which the re-\nquirement described in subsection (a) is effec-\ntive with respect to the service described in \nsuch recommendation or guideline. \n(2) Minimum \nThe interval described in paragraph (1) shall \nnot be less than 1 year. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). The \u201cminimum interval\u201d re-\nquirement does not apply to HRSA\u2019s guidelines regard-\ning preventive care and screenings for women. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). \nSince the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment, these en-\ntities have issued numerous decrees that force health-\ninsurance issuers and self-insured plans to cover certain \nforms of preventive care without cost-sharing. In 2011, \nfor example, the Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration issued a highly controversial pronouncement \nthat compels private insurance to cover all FDA-\napproved contraceptive methods, including contraceptive \nmethods that some regard as abortifacients\u2014and to do \nso without requiring the beneficiary to pay anything in \ncopays or out-of-pocket expenses, and without allowing \nthe expenses to count toward an annual deductible. See \nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 733 \n(2014). In June of 2019, the U.S. Preventive Services \nTask Force issued an equally controversial diktat that \nrequires all private insurers to cover pre-exposure \nprophylaxis (PrEP) drugs such as Truvada and Descovy \nstarting in 2021. These drugs, like contraception, must \n\n \n \n \n7\nbe covered without any cost-sharing arrangements and \nmust be funded entirely by premiums paid by others, \nwithout any marginal costs imposed on the beneficiary.  \nI. \nTHE U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE \nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was created \nin 1984, and the statute governing the Task Force is codi-\nfied at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a) (Pet. App. 138a\u2013141a). The \nTask Force\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201creview the scien-\ntific evidence related to the effectiveness, appropriate-\nness, and cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive ser-\nvices for the purpose of developing recommendations for \nthe health care community, and updating previous clini-\ncal preventive recommendations.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(1); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2) (listing other \n\u201cduties\u201d of the Task Force).  \nThe statute governing the Task Force requires the \nDirector of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ) to \u201cconvene\u201d an \u201cindependent Preven-\ntive Services Task Force\u201d for these purposes. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute requires that the Task Force \nbe \u201ccomposed of individuals with appropriate expertise.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The statute also guarantees the \nindependence of the Task Force and its recommenda-\ntions by specifying that:  \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \n\n \n \n \n8\nAlthough the statute does not specify the number of \nTask Force members and is silent about their tenure, \nthere are currently 16 Task Force members and each of \nthem has been appointed to a four-year term.6 Until \nJune of 2023, Task Force members were appointed by \nthe Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ).7 In response to this lawsuit, however, \nthe Task Force members received new appointments \nfrom Secretary Becerra in an effort to blunt the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 Appointments Clause challenge to 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).8 \nBefore the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the \nTask Force performed only advisory functions, and its \n\u201crecommendations\u201d had no binding legal force. And be-\n \n6. See http://bit.ly/48cdU9X [https://perma.cc/7DJS-5VAF]; see al-\nso Pet. at 4. \n7.

See Walter \nDellinger, Constitutional Limitations on Federal Gov-\nernment Participation in Binding Arbitration, 19 U.S. \nOp. Off. Legal Counsel 208, 216 (1995) (\u201c[T]he members \nof a commission that has purely advisory functions need \nnot be officers of the United States because they possess \nno enforcement authority or power to bind the Govern-\nment.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut the Task Force no longer acts in a \u201cpurely advisory\u201d \nrole now that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the \nTask Force to unilaterally dictate the preventive care \nthat health insurance must cover without cost sharing. \nThe members of the Task Force became \u201cofficers of the \nUnited States\u201d when the Affordable Care Act was signed \ninto law\u2014and they must be appointed consistent with \nthe requirements of Article II.  \nII. THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWSUIT \nOn March 29, 2020, the plaintiffs sued and asked a \nfederal district court to declare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1) unconstitutional and enjoin the government \nfrom enforcing the preventive-care coverage mandates \n \n9.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) (per curiam); see also id. \n(\u201c[A]ny appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States is an \u2018Officer of the United States,\u2019 \nand must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2, of that Article.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n10 \nimposed by the Task Force.10 The plaintiffs argued that \nthe Task Force members qualify as \u201cofficers of the Unit-\ned States\u201d under Article II because they wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates\u201d11\u2014and that they must therefore be appointed by \nthe president with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. And \nbecause the Task Force members were not appointed as \n\u201cofficers of the United States\u201d in conformity with Article \nII, their \u201crecommendations\u201d cannot be given legal force \nand cannot bind private insurers. \nIn response to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, Secretary \nBecerra issued a document on January 21, 2022, that \npurports to \u201cratify\u201d all preventive-care coverage man-\ndates that had previously been imposed by the Task \nForce. App. 5a\u20136a. \nA. The District Court\u2019s Ruling \nThe district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the \nmembers of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nqualify as \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d because they (1) \noccupy a \u201ccontinuing position established by law\u201d and (2) \nexercise \u201csignificant authority pursuant to the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d Pet. App. 107a (quoting Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018)). The district court further \nheld that the Task Force members are \u201cprincipal\u201d offic-\ners who must be appointed by the president with the \n \n10. The plaintiffs raised other claims in the district court and in the \ncourt of appeals, but none of those claims are at issue in the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s petition.  \n11.

The district court explained that \u201cinferior\u201d of-\nficers must be \u201c \u2018directed and supervised at some level by \nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. \n115a (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, \n663 (1997)). And it held that Task Force members cannot \nqualify as \u201cinferior\u201d officers because \u201cthey have no supe-\nrior\u201d12 and because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) guarantees \ntheir independence and shields the Task Force and its \nrecommendations from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d Pet.

II. Pet. App. \n116a (\u201c \u2018[T]he term \u201cDepartment\u201d refers only to a part or \ndivision of the executive government, as the Department \nof State, or of the Treasury, expressly created and given \n \n12.

The \nplaintiffs eventually stipulated to a stay of the nation-\nwide injunction and the universal vacatur of the disputed \n\u201cagency actions,\u201d leaving in place only relief that shields \nthe named plaintiffs from statutory penalties and en-\nforcement actions for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-\n13(a)(1).13 In exchange for this stipulation, the defend-\nants promised that they would not seek penalties against \nthe plaintiffs for actions taken in reliance on the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment if that judgment were to be vacated or \nnarrowed on appeal.14  \n \n13.

The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRuling \nOn \nThe \nAppointments Clause Issues \nThe court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s rul-\ning that the Task Force members were unconstitutional-\nly appointed.

[W]e \nneed look no further than the statutory provi-\nsion we just addressed, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6), which again provides that \u201c[a]ll mem-\nbers of the Task Force . . . , and any recom-\nmendations made by such members, shall be \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d . . . . [I]t is a clear \nand express directive from Congress that the \nTask Force be free from any supervision. In \nour view, the Task Force cannot be \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d and free from \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d on the \none hand, and at the same time be supervised \nby the HHS Secretary, a political appointee, on \nthe other. \nPet. App. 20a. The court of appeals declined the defend-\nants\u2019 invitation to invoke the constitutional-avoidance \ncanon and construe 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a manner \nthat would allow the Secretary to \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csuper-\nvise\u201d the Task Force\u2019s recommendations, holding that \nany such interpretation of section 299b-4(a)(6) would be \nincompatible with the statutory text and structure. Pet. \nApp. 23a (\u201c[T]he statutory scheme . . . envisions no su-\npervisory role for the Secretary, and that is especially \nclear in light of the express congressional preference \nthat the Task Force be independent and not subject to \npolitical pressure.\u201d); see also Jennings v.

The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Ruling On The Remedial \nIssues \nThe court of appeals rejected the universal remedy \nimposed by the district court because the plaintiffs had \nfailed to explicitly assert an APA claim in their pleading. \nPet. App. 37a. But the court of appeals left in place the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that restrains the de-\nfendants from enforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and \nthe Task Force \u201crecommendations\u201d against the named \nplaintiffs. Pet. App. 30a\u201343a.  \nThe defendants had proposed a different remedy that \nwould \u201csever the limitations on secretarial oversight in \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)\u201d and authorize Secretary Becer-\nra to direct and supervise the Task Force\u2019s preventive-\ncare coverage mandates despite the restrictions under \nsection 299b-4(a)(6). Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But the court of appeals rejected this \nremedy because the federal judiciary has no power to \nformally revoke a statute or confer new powers on a cab-\ninet secretary that Congress has explicitly withheld. Pet. \nApp. 31a\u201333a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari for three reasons. \nFirst, the court of appeals determined that 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violates the Appointments Clause by \nconferring authority on Task Force members who were \nnot appointed in conformity with Article II. This Court \n\n \n \n \n18 \nwill almost always grant certiorari when a lower court \npronounces an Act of Congress unconstitutional, and \nthere is nothing out of the ordinary that might be in-\nvoked to suggest a different approach here.  \nSecond, although the court of appeals rejected the \ndistrict court\u2019s universal remedy and limited relief to the \nnamed plaintiffs, a denial of certiorari will leave the court \nof appeals\u2019 ruling and opinion in place as binding prece-\ndent in the fifth circuit. This will allow other plaintiffs in \nthe fifth circuit to sue the defendants under the APA and \nobtain the universal remedies that the district court had \nawarded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(a), as the precedent of \nthe fifth circuit compels federal district courts to \u201cset \naside,\u201d i.e., formally vacate, any \u201cagency actions\u201d taken \nto implement 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) or the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates recommended by the Task \nForce. See In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA challenge, this \ncourt must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires recission ac-\ntion, with nationwide effect.\u201d). This Court should rule on \nthe merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims before \nauthorizing a dramatic nationwide remedy of this sort.  \nThird, this petition presents a suitable vehicle for \nreaching the Appointments Clause and remedial issues \ndiscussed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \nlingering jurisdictional issues that might prevent this \nCourt from reaching the merits, and no competing peti-\ntions (or soon-to-be-filed petitions) in the pipeline. \n\n \n \n \n19 \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE \nCOURT\u2019S \nNORMAL \nPRACTICE \nIS \nTO \nGRANT \nCERTIORARI \nWHEN \nAN \nACT \nOF \nCONGRESS IS HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL  \nAs the Solicitor General observes, this Court\u2019s usual \npractice is to grant certiorari when a lower court finds an \nAct of Congress unconstitutional, without regard to \nwhether the lower court\u2019s ruling implicates a circuit con-\nflict. Pet. 27\u201328 (citing authorities). And for good reason. \nThis Court has repeatedly (and correctly) observed that \npronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is \u201c \u2018the \ngravest and most delicate\u2019 \u201d task of the federal judiciary. \nShelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 556 (2013) (quot-\ning Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, \nJ., concurring)). The respect to which Congress is enti-\ntled as a coordinate branch of the federal government \ndemands review from the highest court before a federal \nstatute\u2019s enforcement is permanently thwarted or en-\njoined. \nThe Solicitor General suggests that the lower courts \nmerely declared the Task Force\u2019s structure unconstitu-\ntional,18 but the rulings also address the constitutionality \nof the underlying legislation. The court of appeals\u2019 ruling \nmeans that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) is unconstitutional \nto the extent it confers authority on Task Force members \nwho were not appointed by the president with the Sen-\nate\u2019s advice and consent. Pet. App. 12a\u201326a. And the dis-\n \n18. Pet. at 27 (\u201cThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision declares the Task \nForce\u2019s structure unconstitutional\u201d).  \n\n \n \n \n20 \ntrict court\u2019s judgment (as modified by the court of ap-\npeals) continues to enjoin the government from enforc-\ning 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) against the named plain-\ntiffs. App. 2a. The statute itself was ruled unconstitu-\ntional\u2014at least in part and at least as applied to the \nplaintiffs\u2014and that warrants review consistent with the \nlongstanding practice of this Court.  \nThere is also no reason to depart from the Court\u2019s \nusual practice here. The federal statute at issue is of im-\nmense importance, and it is a key component of one of \nthe most significant and controversial pieces of legisla-\ntion that Congress has ever enacted. The Court should \nweigh in rather than leaving the constitutionality of 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the appointments of the Task \nForce members to be resolved entirely by the court of \nappeals. \nII. A DENIAL OF CERTIORARI WILL ALLOW A \nNEW \nLITIGANT \nTO \nSUE \nAND \nOBTAIN \nNATIONWIDE \nRELIEF \nAGAINST \nTHE \nENFORCEMENT OF 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)  \nThe Solicitor General is also correct to observe that a \ndenial of certiorari will leave the door open for a new \nplaintiff to sue and quickly revive the universal remedies \nthat the district court had awarded to the plaintiffs. Pet. \nat 30\u201331. The court of appeals vacated the district court\u2019s \nuniversal remedies only because the plaintiffs had not \npleaded an APA claim in their complaint. Pet. App. 37a. \nIn doing so, the court of appeals acknowledged that fifth \ncircuit precedent requires courts to \u201cset aside\u2014i.e., \nformally nullify and revoke\u201d any unlawful agency actions \nthat a litigant challenges under section 706 of the APA. \n\n \n \n \n21 \nPet. App. 35a (quoting Data Marketing Partnership, LP \nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, 45 F.4th 846, 859 (5th \nCir. 2022); see also In re Clarke, 94 F.4th 502, 512 (5th \nCir. 2024) (\u201cShould plaintiffs prevail on their APA chal-\nlenge, this court must \u2018set aside\u2019 CFTC\u2019s ultra vires re-\ncission action, with nationwide effect.\u201d). Vacatur in the \nfifth circuit is a universal remedy that wipes out the dis-\nputed agency actions and prevents the agency from en-\nforcing them against anyone. See id.; Career Colleges & \nSchool of Texas v. United States Dep\u2019t of Education, 98 \nF.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201cSection 706 . . . is not par-\nty-restricted and allows a court to \u2018set aside\u2019 an unlawful \nagency action. The term \u2018set aside\u2019 means invalidation\u2014\nand an invalid rule may not be applied to anyone.\u201d (cita-\ntions and some internal quotation marks omitted)). So if \nthis Court denies certiorari, a new litigant can sue the \ndefendants anywhere in the fifth circuit, and that plain-\ntiff will be entitled to a universal remedy so long as he \npleads a claim under the APA. This will result in a na-\ntionwide injunction that vacates every agency action tak-\nen to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preven-\ntive-care coverage mandates imposed by the Task \nForce.19  \n \n19. The government could try to limit the scope of relief by raising a \nstatute-of-limitations defense. But the plaintiffs can easily get \naround this by recruiting an employer plaintiff that only recent-\nly came into existence, or by creating a new membership associ-\nation and using that as the plaintiff. See Corner Post, Inc. v. \nBoard of Governors of Federal Reserve System, 144 S. Ct. 2440 \n(2024); Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and \nFellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181, 200\u201301 (2023). \n\n \n \n \n22 \nThe Court should grant certiorari before allowing \nthis to happen. A universal remedy against the enforce-\nment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) will undo every pre-\nventive-care coverage mandate imposed by the Task \nForce with nationwide effect. And a ruling of this sort \nwill surely be appealed (if not by the Department of Jus-\ntice than by a defendant\u2013intervenor) and reach this \nCourt again on petition for certiorari, as any fifth circuit \npanel will remain bound by that court\u2019s precedent on \nboth the constitutional and remedial issues. The sounder \napproach is to grant certiorari now and resolve these is-\nsues, rather than invite a future lawsuit that will restore \nthe universal remedies issued by the district court and \nproduce another certiorari petition presenting the same \nquestions as this one.  \nIII. THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS THAT \nMIGHT COUNSEL IN FAVOR OF WAITING FOR A \nDIFFERENT PETITION \nThis case also presents a suitable vehicle for resolv-\ning the Appointments Clause and remedial issues de-\nscribed in the Solicitor General\u2019s petition. There are no \npotential jurisdictional landmines that could derail this \ncase if certiorari is granted. Braidwood Management \nInc., the lead respondent, easily has Article III standing \nbecause it operates a self-insured plan and employs more \nthan 50 full-time workers.20 Braidwood is compelled by \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) and the preventive-care cov-\n \n20.

Tex.), ECF No. 46.  \n\n \n \n \n23 \nerage mandates to underwrite services that it would ra-\nther exclude, and it is restricted from imposing any cost-\nsharing arrangements for any of the preventive care de-\ncreed by the Task Force.21 That alone is enough to estab-\nlish standing. See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., \n573 U.S. 682, 706 (2014); Pet. App. 95a (\u201cBraidwood pre-\nsents the easiest case for standing.\u201d); id.

And there is no need for any \nof the remaining respondents to make an independent \nshowing of standing when Braidwood\u2019s standing is se-\ncure. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023) (\u201cIf \nat least one plaintiff has standing, the suit may pro-\nceed.\u201d).22  \n \n21. Declaration of Steven F.

The Solicitor General notes that Braidwood \u201cdoes not allege . . . \nthat any of its employees have ever sought coverage for PrEP \nmedications.\u201d Pet. at 7. But that does not defeat Braidwood\u2019s \nArticle III standing to challenge the appointments of the Task \nForce members, or the lawfulness of the PrEP drug coverage \nmandate, and the Solicitor General does not argue or even sug-\ngest that it does. The mere requirement to provide this cover-\nage inflicts injury in fact because it requires Braidwood to alter \nthe content and scope of its self-insured plan documents. See \nUnited States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Pro-\ncedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973) (\u201c[A]n identifia-\nble trifle is enough for standing\u201d (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n\n \n \n \n24 \nThis case also presents a good vehicle because the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 opinion is careful and scholarly. Pet. \nApp. 1a\u201348a. Even if one disagrees with its ultimate con-\nclusions, the opinion contains helpful and thoughtful dis-\ncussion that will assist the parties and this Court when \nthey argue and decide these issues. Finally, we are una-\nware of any other cases pending in the lower courts that \ninvolve the questions presented in this petition, so there \nare no other candidates or potential competitors that will \narise any time soon if the Court decides to pass on this \ncase.  \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI \nEVEN \nTHOUGH \nIT \nSHOULD \nREJECT \nTHE \nSOLICITOR GENERAL\u2019S CRITICISMS OF THE \nCOURT OF APPEALS\u2019 OPINION \nThe Solicitor General spends much of her petition ar-\nguing that the court of appeals\u2019 decision is wrong and \nthat the Court should grant certiorari for that reason. \nPet. 13\u201327. None of this, however, affects the certworthi-\nness of the petition. The Court should grant certiorari \nregardless of whether it agrees with the court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis because the lower courts pronounced an Act of \nCongress unconstitutional\u2014and that alone is sufficient \nto warrant certiorari when the case involves a federal \nstatute of this significance and magnitude. See supra, at \n19\u201320.  \nA petition-stage brief is not normally the place to de-\nbate the merits of the court of appeals\u2019 ruling. But the \nSolicitor General\u2019s attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 opin-\nion are unwarranted and should not go unanswered. We \nwill briefly rebut the Solicitor General\u2019s criticisms and \n\n \n \n \n25 \ndefend the court of appeals\u2019 holdings on the Appoint-\nments Clause and the remedial issues, which should be \naffirmed across the board if the Court decides to take up \nthis case.  \nA. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Held That The Task \nForce \nMembers \nAre \n\u201cPrincipal\u201d \nRather \nThan \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officers \nThe Solicitor General acknowledges that the Task \nForce members are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who \nmust be appointed in conformity with Article II. Pet. 14. \nBut she insists that the Task Force members are \u201cinferi-\nor officers,\u201d and that Congress may therefore vest their \nappointment in a \u201cHead of Department\u201d such as Secre-\ntary Becerra. See id. at 14\u201322. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly rejected this argument. \nAn \u201cinferior\u201d officer is an officer whose work is \u201cdi-\nrected and supervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363; \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) \n(same). That direction and supervision is absent here. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) empowers the Task Force\u2014and \nthe Task Force alone\u2014to determine the preventive care \nthat private insurers must cover. Neither Secretary \nBecerra, nor any other officer of the United States, has \nstatutory authority to countermand any preventive-care \nedict issued by the Task Force. Indeed, no other officer \ncan even influence the Task Force\u2019s decisions, as 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) provides that Task Force members \nand their recommendations \u201cshall be independent and, to \nthe extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n26 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1) (requiring the Director \nof AHRQ to \u201cconvene an independent Preventive Ser-\nvices Task Force\u201d (emphasis added)). These statutory \nguarantees of independence preclude any officer of the \nUnited States from reviewing or reversing the Task \nForce\u2019s recommendations, and the absence of \u201cstatutory \nauthority\u201d to review Task Force decisions makes its \nmembers principal officers. See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 15 \n(\u201cstatutory authority to review\u201d decisions is needed to \nmake one an inferior officer); id. at 19 (\u201c[A]dequate su-\npervision entails review of decisions issued by inferior \nofficers.\u201d). \nThe Solicitor General nonetheless insists that the \nTask Force is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by Secretary \nBecerra despite the guarantees of independence in sec-\ntions 299b-4(a)(1) and (a)(6). First, the Solicitor General \nobserves that Task Force members are removable at will \nby the Secretary, which (according to the Solicitor Gen-\neral) gives the Secretary all the powers of \u201cdirection\u201d \nand \u201csupervision\u201d needed to satisfy Edmond\u2019s test for \ninferior-officer status. Pet. at 14\u201318. Second, the Solicitor \nGeneral contends that the constitutional-avoidance canon \nrequires courts to interpret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) in a \nmanner that gives the Secretary whatever supervisory \npowers he needs to make the Task Force members into \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. Neither argument works.  \n1. An Officer Does Not Automatically Become An \n\u201cInferior\u201d Officer Whenever He Is Subject To At-\nWill Removal By A Principal Officer \nThis Court has never held that an officer is automati-\ncally deemed \u201cinferior\u201d whenever he is subject to at-will \n\n \n \n \n27 \nremoval by a principal officer. Instead, removability is \nmerely one factor to consider in deciding whether an of-\nficer falls on the \u201cprincipal\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d side of the line. \nSee Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365 (designating military \njudges inferior officers because they were subject to ad-\nministrative oversight, were \u201cremov[able] . . . without \ncause,\u201d and had \u201cno power to render a final decision\u201d); \nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 671\u201372 (1988) (an of-\nficer\u2019s removability is one of four factors in the inferior-\nofficer inquiry); Appointment and Removal of Federal \nReserve Bank Members of the Federal Open Market \nCommittee, 43 Op. O.L.C. ___, 2019 WL 11594453, at \n**9\u201310 (2019) (\u201cTo decide whether an officer has a supe-\nrior, the Supreme Court has considered whether the of-\nficer is subject to the policy direction of another official, \nwhether the officer can take \u2018final\u2019 action without the ap-\nproval of another officer, and whether an executive of-\nficer other than the President has the \u2018power to remove \n[the] officer[].\u2019\u201d (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 664\u201365)). \nThe Task Force members are principal officers be-\ncause their preventive-care coverage decisions are not \nsubject to review or reversal by anyone else in the execu-\ntive branch\u2014and that remains the case regardless of \nwhether the Secretary can remove them at will. See Ed-\nmond, 520 U.S. at 665 (\u201cWhat is significant is that the \njudges of the Court of Criminal Appeals have no power \nto render a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d). \nThe touchstone for inferior-officer status is whether the \nindividual is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a principal of-\nficer, not whether he is subject to at-will removal. Id. at \n\n \n \n \n28 \n663; see also Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13 (\u201cAn inferior officer \nmust be \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Edmond, \n520 U.S. at 663)). The Task Force members\u2014even if re-\nmovable at will\u2014would still have the \u201c \u2018power to render \na final decision on behalf of the United States\u2019 without \n. . . review by their nominal superior or any other princi-\npal officer in the Executive Branch.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n14 (quoting Edmond, 520 U.S. at 665)). At-will removal \nwould allow Secretary Becerra to fire Task Force mem-\nbers if he is unhappy with their performance, but it \nwould not empower him to overrule their recommenda-\ntions or direct their decisionmaking given the guarantee \nof independence in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n2. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) Cannot Be Interpreted To \nGive The Secretary Powers To \u201cDirect\u201d Or \n\u201cSupervise\u201d The Task Force Members Or Their \nRecommendations \nThe Solicitor General also urges this Court to inter-\npret 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) to give the Secretary just \nenough powers of \u201cdirection\u201d and \u201csupervision\u201d over the \nTask Force so that its members can be squeezed into the \n\u201cinferior officer\u201d cubbyhole. Pet. at 19\u201322. The Solicitor \nGeneral insists that the constitutional-avoidance canon \ncompels this construction, even though the statutory text \nrequires Task Force members and recommendations to \nremain \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cto the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d There are two insur-\nmountable problems with the Solicitor General\u2019s argu-\nment.  \n\n \n \n \n29 \nFirst. The constitutional-avoidance canon is inappli-\ncable because the Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpre-\ntation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) will not avoid an Ap-\npointments Clause violation. Even if one adopts the So-\nlicitor General\u2019s construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nand gives the Secretary all of the powers needed to turn \nthe Task Force members into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d the Task \nForce still has not been constitutionally appointed be-\ncause it members were tapped by the Director of AHRQ, \nwho is not a \u201cHead of Department.\u201d The government \nrecognizes this problem and is trying to fix it by having \nthe Secretary re-appoint the Task Force.23 But Congress \nhas not \u201cvested\u201d Secretary Becerra with appointment \nauthority over the Task Force, as required by Article II. \nAnd even if Congress had \u201cvested\u201d this appointment \npower in the Secretary, the past coverage recommenda-\ntions of the Task Force still cannot be implemented be-\ncause its members were unconstitutionally appointed \nwhen those recommendations were made. See Lucia v. \nSEC, 585 U.S. 237, 251\u201352 (2018); Ryder v. United \nStates, 515 U.S 177, 182\u201383 (1995). The statutes govern-\ning the Task Force and its coverage mandates violate the \nAppointments Clause no matter how 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) is construed\u2014and regardless of whether the \nTask Force members are pigeonholed as \u201cprincipal\u201d or \n\u201cinferior\u201d officers. \nSecond. The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) is \nnot \u201creadily susceptible\u201d to the Solicitor General\u2019s inter-\npretation. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 481 \n \n23. See note 8 and accompanying test. \n\n \n \n \n30 \n(2010) (\u201c[T]his Court may impose a limiting construction \non a statute only if it is readily susceptible to such a con-\nstruction. We will not rewrite a . . . law to conform it to \nconstitutional requirements, for doing so would consti-\ntute a serious invasion of the legislative domain\u201d (cita-\ntions and internal quotation marks omitted)); Seila Law \nLLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 \nU.S. 197, 230 (2020) (\u201cConstitutional avoidance is not a \nlicense to rewrite Congress\u2019s work to say whatever the \nConstitution needs it to say in a given situation.\u201d). Con-\nsider the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6): \nAll members of the Task Force convened under \nthis subsection, and any recommendations \nmade by such members, shall be independent \nand, to the extent practicable, not subject to \npolitical pressure. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). The idea that the Secretary can \n\u201cdirect\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d the Task Force members is in-\ncompatible with the statutory guarantees of \u201cindepend-\nence\u201d and immunity from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The Solici-\ntor General acknowledges that the requirement of \u201cin-\ndependence\u201d means that the Task Force members must \nuse \u201ctheir own best judgment,\u201d and that its recommen-\ndations may \u201cnot be influenced by outside pressures.\u201d \nPet. at 19. But that means that the Secretary cannot \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d the Task Force, because if he did then the Task \nForce members would no longer be using \u201ctheir own best \njudgment\u201d and would \u201cbe influenced by outside pres-\nsures.\u201d And that means that the Task Force members fail \nthe Edmond test for inferior-officer status, even under \nthe Solicitor General\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u201cinde-\n\n \n \n \n31 \npendent,\u201d because their work is not \u201cdirected and super-\nvised at some level by others who were appointed by \nPresidential nomination with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 662\u201363.24 \nThe Solicitor General also claims that the phrase \u201cto \nthe extent practicable\u201d should be interpreted to mean \u201cto \nthe extent constitutional.\u201d Pet. 20\u201321. But this qualifier \nattaches only to the requirement that Task Force mem-\nbers be shielded from \u201cpolitical pressure.\u201d The command \nthat Task Force members and recommendations \u201cshall \nbe independent\u201d is absolute, and there is no statutory \nlanguage that gives the Secretary wiggle room to com-\npromise the independence required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1). The Solicitor Gen-\neral does not explain how the Task Force members (and \ntheir recommendations) can simultaneously be \u201cinde-\npendent\u201d yet subject to the \u201cdirection\u201d of the Secretary. \nDoes anyone think the Federal Reserve would remain \n\u201cindependent\u201d (under any understanding of that word) if \nthe president or the Secretary of the Treasury could \u201cdi-\nrect\u201d its interest-rate decisions? \n \n24. The Solicitor General is careful to claim only that her interpre-\ntation of the word \u201cindependent\u201d allows for secretarial \u201csupervi-\nsion\u201d of the Task Force\u2014and not secretarial \u201cdirection\u201d of its \ndecisions. Pet. at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he reference to \u2018independence\u2019 is \nmost naturally read to require the Task Force members to \nmake \u201cunbiased, independent judgments,\u201d even while subject to \nsecretarial supervision with respect to their conduct and the ef-\nfect of their recommendations.\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n\n \n \n \n32 \nB. The Court Of Appeals Correctly Refused To Remedy \nThe Appointments Clause Violations By \u201cSevering\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6) \nThe Solicitor General insists that the district court \nshould have remedied the Appointments Clause viola-\ntions by \u201csevering\u201d the statutory provision that guaran-\ntees the independence of the Task Force and prohibits \npolitical interference with its recommendations, thereby \nallowing the Secretary to direct and supervise the Task \nForce and its preventive-care coverage recommenda-\ntions. Pet. at 22\u201327. This remedy is unlawful for many \nreasons. \nThe first problem is that a regime in which the Secre-\ntary is permitted to countermand the \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recom-\nmendations of the Task Force still violates the Appoint-\nments Clause. The Solicitor General\u2019s proposed remedy \nwould allow the Secretary to overrule the Task Force\u2019s \n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d recommendations but not its failure to rec-\nommend coverage of items or services under 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1). See Pet. at 24 (\u201cThe court therefore \nshould have severed Section 299b-4(a)(6)\u2019s application to \nTask Force \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations, thus giving the \nSecretary \u2018authority to provide for a means of reviewing\u2019 \nthose recommendations.\u201d). This would create a regime in \nwhich both the Secretary and the Task Force have gate-\nkeeping functions in deciding which preventive care the \nprivate insurers must cover. But that means the Task \nForce will still wield \u201csignificant authority pursuant to \nthe laws of the United States,\u201d25 because preventive-care \n \n25. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 126. \n\n \n \n \n33 \ncoverage mandates cannot and will not take effect under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) without its recommendation \nand approval.26 And it does not make the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d because no principal \nofficer has any ability to review or countermand their \ndecisions not to adopt an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation. \nSee Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14\u201315. Moreover, even if the de-\nfendants\u2019 proposed remedy converted the Task Force \nmembers into \u201cinferior officers,\u201d their appointments \nwould still violate the Constitution because Congress has \nnot opted out of the default method of appointment in \nArticle II. \nThere is a more serious problem with the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s proposed remedy: A federal court has no pow-\ner to cancel the statutory provision in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-\n4(a)(6) or confer powers on a cabinet secretary that Con-\ngress has explicitly withheld. A federal district court\u2019s \nremedial tools extend to declaratory judgments, injunc-\ntions, APA remedies, and writs\u2014and these remedies are \nlimited by statute and historical practice. See Whole \nWoman\u2019s Health v. Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 44 (2021). The \nSolicitor General does not explain how her proposed \nremedy fits into any of these categories, or how the dis-\ntrict-court judgment that must be entered on remand \nwill be able to implement her proposed remedy. \n \n26. The Solicitor General appears to acknowledge that her proposed \nremedy would not strip Task Force members of their status as \n\u201cofficers.\u201d See Appellants\u2019 Br. at 38 (describing the Task Force \nmembers as \u201cinferior officers\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n34 \nThe final problem with the Solicitor General\u2019s reme-\ndy is that it will not redress the plaintiffs\u2019 Article III in-\njuries, which are caused by the Secretary\u2019s enforcement \nof the preventive-care mandates, not by his failure to re-\nview or ratify them. A remedy that fails to redress the \nplaintiffs\u2019 injuries is incompatible with Article III. See \nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. \n83, 107 (1998) (\u201cRelief that does not remedy the injury \nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into federal court.\u201d). \n \n* * * \nThe Court should nonetheless grant certiorari be-\ncause the court of appeals\u2019 opinion, though well-reasoned \nand correct, declared an Act of Congress unconstitution-\nal (at least in part) and enjoined its enforcement against \nthe named plaintiffs. The Court typically grants certio-\nrari when a court of appeals disapproves a federal stat-\nute on constitutional grounds, and there is no reason not \nto do so here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nGENE P.

R. Civ. P. \n58(a). \nThis action came on for consideration by the Court, \nand the issues having been duly considered and a deci-\nsion duly rendered in the Court\u2019s orders partially grant-\ning and partially denying the parties\u2019 motions for sum-\nmary judgment. \nIt is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED that: \n\n 2a \n1)  All claims of Joel Miller and Gregory Scheideman \nin the above-entitled and numbered cause are \nhereby DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n \n2) The Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-\ntices (ACIP) and the Health Resources and Ser-\nvices Administration (HRSA) do not, on the rec-\nord in this case, violate Article II\u2019s Appointments \nclause. Therefore, Braidwood Management Inc., \nKelley Orthodontics, John Kelley, Joel Starnes, \nZach Maxwell, and Ashley Maxwell\u2019s (remaining \nPlaintiffs) Claim No. 1 as it pertains to ACIP and \nHRSA is DISMISSED with prejudice to the re-\nfiling of same or any part thereof. \n \n3) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s \n(PSTF) recommendations operating in conjunc-\ntion with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) violate Article \nII\u2019s Appointments Clause and are therefore un-\nlawful. Therefore, any and all agency actions tak-\nen to implement or enforce the preventive care \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d recommendation by the PSTF on or after \nMarch 23, 2010 are VACATED and Defendants \nand their officers, agents, servants, and employ-\nees are ENJOINED from implementing or en-\nforcing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2019s compulsory \ncoverage requirements in response to an \u201cA\u201d or \n\u201cB\u201d rating from PSTF in the future. \n \n \nFurther, any and all agency action taken to im-\nplement or enforce the preventive care mandates \n\n 3a \nin response to an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d recommendation by \nPSTF on or after March 23, 2010 and made com-\npulsory under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) are \nDECLARED unlawful as violative of the Ap-\npointments Clause. Therefore, Braidwood Man-\nagement Inc. and Kelley Orthodontics, and to the \nextent applicable, individual Plaintiffs need not \ncomply with the preventive care coverage recom-\nmendations of PSTF issued on or after March 23, \n2010, because the members of the Task Force \nhave not been appointed in a manner consistent \nwith Article II\u2019s Appointments Clause. According-\nly, the Court ENJOINS Defendants and their of-\nficers, agents, servants, and employees from im-\nplementing or enforcing the same against these \nPlaintiffs. \n \n4) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)\u2013(a)(4) do not violate \nthe nondelegation doctrine. Therefore, remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 2 is DISMISSED with \nprejudice to the re-filing of same or any part \nthereof. \n \n5) The operation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1) does \nnot violate Article II\u2019s Vesting Clause. Therefore, \nremaining Plaintiffs\u2019 Claim No. 3 is DISMISSED \nwith prejudice to the re-filing of same or any \npart thereof. \n \n6)  Remaining \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nClaim \nNo. \n4 \nis \nDISMISSED with prejudice to the re-filing of \nsame or any part thereof for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted. \n\n 4a \n \n7)  The PrEP mandate violates remaining Plaintiffs\u2019 \nrights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct and is therefore DECLARED unlawful. As \nsuch, remaining Plaintiffs need not comply with \nthe preventive care coverage recommendations of \nPSTF issued on or after March 23, 2010 and the \nCourt ENJOINS Defendants and their officers, \nagents, servants, and employees from implement-\ning or enforcing the PrEP mandate as against \nthese Plaintiffs. \n \n8)  All costs shall be paid by the party incurring the \nsame. \n \n9)  All relief not expressly granted herein is denied. \n \nThe Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to close the \nabove-captioned case. \n \nSO ORDERED on this 30th day of March, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Reed O\u2019Connor  \n \n  \n   \nReed O\u2019Connor \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n\n 5a \nAPPENDIX B \n \nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s preventive services provision, \nSection 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300g-13(a)(1)\u2013(4), requires that group health plans and \nhealth insurance issuers provide coverage without cost-\nsharing for preventive services recommended by or con-\ntained in guidelines supported by the United States Pre-\nventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). \nThrough this provision, Congress recognized the scien-\ntific expertise of these entities. Litigation has been \nbrought questioning the authority under which these en-\ntities have issued recommendations and guidelines for \npreventive services that the Affordable Care Act re-\nquires health plans and issuers to cover without cost-\nsharing. To resolve questions raised in litigation and out \nof an abundance of caution, for purposes of coverage un-\nder the statute, I ratify the below listed guidelines and \nrecommendations for the reasons relied on by the \nUSPSTF, ACIP and the Director of the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention (CDC Director), and the \nHRSA Administrator in their previously published deci-\nsions or analyses regarding the relevant recommenda-\ntions. This action is not intended to suggest any legal de-\nfect or infirmity in the authority of these entities to issue \npreventive service guidelines and recommendations. \n\u2022 Evidence-based clinical preventive services that \nhave in effect a rating of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in the rec-\nommendations of the USPSTF as of the date of \nthis ratification, with the exception of the 2016 \n\n 6a \nUSPSTF recommendation on screening for \nbreast cancer, set forth in Exhibit A, attached; \n\u2022 Immunizations that have in effect a recommenda-\ntion from ACIP and the CDC Director with re-\nspect to the individual involved as of the date of \nthis ratification, set forth in Exhibit B, attached; \n\u2022 With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, \nevidence-informed preventive care and screenings \nprovided for in the comprehensive guidelines sup-\nported by HRSA as of the date of this ratification, \nset forth in Exhibit C, attached; and \n\u2022 With respect to women, such additional preven-\ntive care and screenings as provided for in com-\nprehensive guidelines supported by HRSA for \npurposes of 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 300gg13(a) as of the \ndate of this ratification, set forth in Exhibit D, at-\ntached. \nPursuant to my authority as Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and based on my independent and con-\nsidered review of the actions and decisions listed above, I \nhereby affirm and ratify the above recommendations and \nguidelines. \n \n January 21, 2022 \n \nXavier Becerra \nDate",

This Court granted the government\u2019s \npetition on January 10, 2025.   \nAs economists, amici know that invalidating or \notherwise calling into question the validity of the \nProvision will impose significant costs on individuals, the \nhealth care system, and the larger economy.  In the \nlower \ncourts, \nRespondents \nargued \n\u201c[t]here \nis \nconsiderable \ntension \nbetween \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ninsistence that these preventive-care services are \nvaluable and its simultaneous assumption that people \nwill lose coverage for those services or decline to pay for \nthem if co-pays are added.\u201d5  As we explain, economic \nprinciples rebut this assertion \u2014 there is no such \ntension.  \nAccordingly, Amici write to make three points in \nurging this Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nas to legality of the USPSTF.  First, the Provision rests \non a strong economic foundation.  From an economic \nperspective, optimal insurance design incentivizes high-\nvalue care and deters low-value care.  As we explain, \npreventive services are high value, producing significant \nhealth and economic benefits.  These services are \nprecisely the ones that society should want individuals \n \n \nEvidence from the Affordable Care Act (Jan. 11, 2022), \nhttps://bit.ly/3Js5bFv. \n5 Response to Motion for a Partial Stay of Final Judgment Pending \nAppeal at 15, ECF No. 66. \n\n4 \n \n \nto use because they generate better health outcomes \nover time at low cost.  Those benefits would be lost if \ninsurers and employers were allowed to drop high-value \nservices at their discretion or reimpose cost-sharing, \nparticularly given the substantial research showing that \ncost-sharing strongly deters individuals from obtaining \nservices regardless of their value.    \nSecond, requiring this coverage solves a market \nproblem.  In the U.S. health care system, individuals \nregularly move in and out of different insurance plans.  \nAs a result, no single insurer or group health plan has \nthe full economic incentive to provide coverage for \npreventive care because the cost-savings generated by \nthat care \u2014 for example, the lower cost of treating \ncancers detected earlier \u2014 typically accrue in the future, \noften to a different insurer or employer-sponsored group \nhealth plan.  This asymmetry belies Respondents\u2019 \ncontentions below that, if these services are in fact \nvaluable, insurers and employers will continue to \nprovide the current level of coverage or that consumers \ncan and will pay for these services in the Provision\u2019s \nabsence.6    \nThis problem is particularly acute given the large \nrole Medicare plays in our health insurance system.  \nMedicare guarantees coverage for most U.S. individuals \nwhen they turn 65.  Private insurers know that their \ncustomers are likely to switch to Medicare at that age, \nwhich makes insurers less likely to take on the \nimmediate costs of preventive care because the savings \n \n \n6 See id. \n\n5 \n \n \nare disproportionately realized as the person ages.  That \nin turn leaves Medicare \u2014 and ultimately the taxpayer \n\u2014 to bear the increased costs of an aging population in \npoorer health and with a pent-up demand for services.  \nRequiring private insurers and employer plans to cover \npreventive care helps correct the skewed incentives \ncreated by a fragmented market.   \nThird, and finally, the overall economy benefits from \ninvestment in prevention.  When preventive measures \nforestall disease or detect it earlier, individuals live \nlonger, \nmore \neconomically \nproductive \nlives.  \nLongstanding health economics research has quantified \nthe high economic value of many of the preventive \nservices covered through the Provision.  Without the \nProvision, utilization of preventive care will decrease as \nindividuals respond to increased cost-sharing, as they \npredictably and consistently do, by forgoing care.  That \ndecline in the usage of proven high-value care would \ntranslate into substantial economic loss in the form of \nlost lives and lost years of work. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Preventive Services Provision Rests on Sound \nEconomic Principles Specific to Preventive Care. \nThe ACA\u2019s Preventive Services Provision reflects \ndecades of health economics research regarding the \nadvantages and drawbacks of cost-sharing.  Insurers \nand employers impose cost-sharing to transfer some of \nthe economic burden posed by the generally high cost of \nhealth care services from the insurer or employer to the \nenrollee.  Cost-sharing comes in multiple forms: (1) a co-\npayment, a set amount charged to the consumer at the \n\n6 \n \n \npoint of service; (2) co-insurance, a percentage of the cost \nof a service for which the consumer is responsible; or (3) \na deductible, an annual dollar amount the consumer must \npay for health care services prior to insurance paying out \nclaims.  The cost-cutting effect of cost-sharing, from the \nperspective of the insurer or employer, is not only due to \nthe \nincreased \ndollar \namount \nthe \ninsured \nnow \ncontributes, but also the resulting decrease in health \ncare utilization and the corresponding reduction in total \nclaims the insurer or employer must pay.  Cost-sharing \nhas this depressive effect on utilization because it raises \nthe price of insured care for consumers.  \nStudies consistently demonstrate that individuals \nseek out fewer health care services, across the spectrum \nof care, in response to cost-sharing.  As the landmark \nRAND Health Insurance Experiment found in the \n1970s, enrollees in health plans with higher levels of \ncost-sharing spent less on health care because they \ninitiated fewer episodes of care.7  A recent survey found \nthat 60 percent of adults in employer plans who either \nhad high out-of-pocket costs or deductibles relative to \ntheir income reported not obtaining needed health care \ndue to cost.8  A study of a large self-insured employer\u2019s \nshift from a plan that offered free care to a high \n \n \n7 Amelia Haviland et al., Skin in the Game: How Consumer-\nDirected Plans Affect the Cost and Use of Health Care, RAND \nCorporation (2012), https://bit.ly/46e82eZ. \n8 Sara R.

The \napplication of cost-sharing to these types of services \nleads patients, particularly those with tight budgets, to \nbehave in ways not in the best interest of their health \nand ability to lead long, economically productive lives.   \nTailored cost-sharing that varies based on the type \nof service provided reflects value-based insurance \ndesign (\u201cV-BID\u201d).  V-BID constitutes an approach to \nhealth insurance that aims to incentivize patients and \nproviders to seek out more valuable services in terms of \ntheir cost-effectiveness, i.e., the relationship between \nthe cost of the service and the medical benefit it \n \n \n9 Zarek C.

V-BID has proven effective in \nshaping consumer behavior.  Studies have demonstrated \nthat reducing or eliminating cost-sharing for certain \nprescription drugs or treatments for specific diseases or \nchronic conditions is associated with desired changes in \ntargeted utilization.12  \nPreventive care provides the quintessential example \nof a category of health care services that requires \neconomic incentives to influence optimal consumer \nbehavior.  For the reasons set forth in this brief, \npreventive services provide substantial economic \nbenefits.  Consumers may fail to fully take these benefits \ninto account because these benefits largely accrue in the \nfuture.13  As the above studies demonstrate, consumers \n \n \n11 Am. Med.

Due to this forward-looking role, preventive \ncare requires a national strategy that incentivizes \nuptake across insurance plans, in order to spread risk \nacross public and private insurers.

Virtually all \nAmericans change health coverage over the course of \ntheir lives, often several times.  A change in insurance \ncoverage is a routine occurrence \u2014 a new job comes with \na different employer-sponsored insurance plan, starting \none\u2019s own business may mean purchasing coverage on \nthe individual market, and fluctuations in income lead \nindividuals to churn between Medicaid, the public health \ninsurance program for low-income individuals, and \nprivate insurance.  One study examining the experience \nof low-income adults in certain southern states found \n\u201cnearly one-quarter of Respondents in each state \nreported one or more changes in health insurance status \nduring the previous twelve months.\u201d21  Of course, one of \nthe most common changes in health insurance comes \nwhen individuals turn 65, the age at which most \nAmericans become eligible for Medicare, the public \nhealth insurance program for seniors and certain \nindividuals with disabilities. \nThis fragmented system that relies on a combination \nof public and private insurance, with eligibility rules that \nmake individuals gain and lose eligibility for different \n \n \n21 Benjamin D.

Accordingly, insurers and employers lack the \nincentive to spend money on preventive care when the \nbenefits of that investment will likely accrue to a \ndifferent insurer or employer later in the person\u2019s life.22  \nIn fact, insurers and employers have an economic \nincentive to avoid screenings and early treatments, \nbecause they may no longer cover the individual by the \ntime the health condition worsens.  If a screening detects \na disease in the present, the insurer and employer must \nexpend resources to treat it \u2014 pushing off costs to a \nfuture payer may work to their economic self-interest.  \nThis disincentive to pay for preventive care exists even \nif the service is cost-effective for the individual and \nwould reduce the total resources expended on that \nindividual by various payers over a lifetime.   \nOur \ninsurance \ninfrastructure, \nin \nwhich \nthe \ngovernment provides health coverage for seniors \nthrough Medicare, exacerbates these incentives.  In the \nabsence of the Provision, undiscovered health conditions \nwill worsen, only to be identified once the person has \naged into Medicare.  This increases costs for the \nMedicare program, which are borne by taxpayers.  \nResearch shows significant increases in Medicare \nexpenditures among previously uninsured populations \nwho lacked access to appropriate care prior to becoming \n \n \n22 Bradley Herring, Suboptimal Provision of Preventive Healthcare \nDue to Expected Enrollee Turnover Among Private Insurers, 19 \nHealth Econ. 438 (2010), https://bit.ly/42TTpuy. \n\n15 \n \n \neligible for the program.23  This is particularly true for \nservices that are addressed through preventive \nscreenings, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  \nThe same logic applies to insured individuals who would \ngo without preventive care in the absence of no cost-\nsharing coverage.  Reintroduced cost-sharing or the \nelimination of coverage for these services could reduce \nutilization of preventive care prior to age 65 with a \nresulting increase in Medicare expenditures for those \nwho did not receive these services. \nA similar feedback loop also affects Medicaid.  Low-\nincome individuals frequently churn between Medicaid \nand private insurance (or no insurance at all) as changes \nin their income affect their eligibility for the program.24  \nIf individuals forgo preventive services due to cost when \nnot on Medicaid, conditions may worsen by the time they \nregain eligibility, posing increased costs.

Lung Ass\u2019n, Lung Cancer Key \nFindings, https://bit.ly/43haToe (last updated Nov. 13, 2024) (\u201cLung \ncancer screening has saved 80,000 additional years of life leading to \n$40 million in savings, which would increase to 500,000 additional \nyears of life and $500 million if all those eligible had been \nscreened.\u201d). \n\n19 \n \n \nestimated at $26 billion per year.33  For example, lung \ncancer is the third most common cancer and the leading \ncause of cancer mortality in the United States34  and is \nsignificantly more treatable when detected early.35  \nEarlier diagnosis and treatment can lead to shortened \ntreatment courses, ultimately reducing the financial \nimpact on patients and families and enabling patients to \ncontinue participation in the workforce for longer.36  \nPrEP.  Utilization of HIV preexposure prophylaxis \n(PrEP) not only protects the individual using PrEP from \ncontracting HIV, but results in community-wide \nreductions in HIV prevalence.  One study found that if \nthe number of individuals using PrEP increased by only \n25%, a 54% decrease in new HIV cases would result.37  \nThe potential economic impacts are staggering, as one \nstudy found that avoiding just one additional HIV \n \n \n33 Zura Kakushadze, Rakesh Raghubanshi, & Willie Yu, Estimating \nCost Savings from Early Cancer Diagnosis, 2 Data 13 (2017), \nhttps://bit.ly/46surWa. \n34 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Lung Cancer \nStatistics (June 13, 2024), http://bit.ly/4gFMxYu. \n35 Joel V.

Prenatal \nscreenings and services promote healthy babies and \neventually, productive adults.  USPSTF-recommended \nprenatal care includes services related to preeclampsia, \ngestational diabetes, and healthy weight, as well as \nscreening for domestic violence,40  and USPSTF-\nrecommended post-natal care includes breast feeding \nservices \nand \nsupports \nand \nservices \nrelated \nto \n \n \n38 Bruce R.

Studies demonstrate that \n\u201cchildren with low birth weight are less likely to pass \nEnglish and math exams at age 16 and less likely to be \nemployed in their 20s and 30s.\u201d45  Care that \u201cincreas[es] \na child\u2019s birth weight reduces risks of mortality in the \n \n \n41 Id.

Rev. \n693 (1976) ........................................................................ 23 \n \n \n\n \n(1) \nINTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE \nStates have a vital interest in \u201cprotecting [the] sepa-\nration of powers by curtailing unlawful executive action.\u201d \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187 (5th Cir. 2015), \naff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 579 U.S. 547 (2016) \n(per curiam). States regularly file amicus briefs to vindi-\ncate that interest, with the \u201cultimate purpose\u201d of \u201cpro-\ntect[ing] the liberty and security of the governed.\u201d \nMetro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for Abatement \nof Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 272 (1991). \nStates have a special interest, moreover, in ensuring \nthat those who wield federal power are properly ap-\npointed. On its face, the Appointments Clause protects \nStates by ensuring that no officer can be appointed with-\nout the Senate\u2019s consent or, at a minimum, without legis-\nlation vesting the appointment \u201cin the President alone, \nin the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\u201d \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2; see also Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 660-61 (1997) (\u201cThe prescribed man-\nner of appointment for principal officers is also the de-\nfault manner of appointment for inferior officers.\u201d). Be-\ncause every State enjoys equal representation in the \nSenate, and because the difficulty of navigating bicamer-\nalism and presentment inherently benefits the States, \nthese structural safeguards help protect States from fed-\neral overreach. \nIn addition, a coalition of States has filed an amicus \nbrief in support of the federal government. Given the im-\nportance of the issues in this litigation, the Court should \nalso hear from States supporting Respondents.1       \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\u201c[T]he very definition of a Republic, is \u2018an Empire of \nLaws, and not of men.\u2019\u201d John Adams, Thoughts on Gov-\nernment (1776). This principle motivates the vertical \nseparation of powers: Congress lacks the States\u2019 \u201cbroad \nauthority to enact legislation for the public good\u2014what \n[courts] have often called a \u2018police power.\u2019\u201d Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 854 (2014) (quoting United \nStates v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995)). It also runs \nthrough the horizontal separation of powers: A federal \nofficial \u201c\u2018literally has no power to act\u2019 \u2026 unless and until \nCongress\u201d confers power to do so. FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. \n289, 301 (2022) (quoting La. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, \n476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986)). \nHere, the federal government has amassed an ar-\nmada of amici. Almost all of them, however, advance pol-\nicy arguments why the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce is valuable\u2014not legal arguments why the appoint-\nment of Task Force members comports with the Consti-\ntution. States are mindful of such policy concerns and un-\nderstand why insurers offer coverage for preventive \ncare. In fact, mandates for preventive care often are not \nnecessary precisely because such care can reduce an in-\nsurer\u2019s costs. See, e.g., Greg Goth, Why Broad Preven-\ntive Care Coverage Is Here to Stay, SHRM (Dec. 2, \n2022), https://perma.cc/AX6Q-W8JU (\u201cEven without a \nmandate, employers are unlikely to impose cost-sharing \nfor preventive services.\u201d).  \nCourts, however, are not the forum for policy argu-\nments. Under the Constitution, those who wield \u201csignifi-\ncant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\u201d \nare officers who must be appointed consistent with the \nAppointments Clause. Lucia v. SEC, 585 U.S. 237, 245 \n(2018) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 126 (1976) \n\n3 \n \n(per curiam)). Every principal officer thus must be nom-\ninated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, \nand every inferior officer must be similarly appointed \nunless Congress by law vests their appointment \u201cin the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \nDepartments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  \nAlthough amici States agree with Respondents that \nTask Force members are principal officers, the Court \nneed not reach that issue because\u2014even if they were in-\nferior officers\u2014Congress has not vested their appoint-\nment \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in \nthe Heads of Departments.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the \u201cde-\nfault\u201d rule, Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660, of presidential \nnomination and senatorial confirmation controls. \u201cCalls \nto abandon\u201d separation-of-powers requirements based \non claimed \u201cnecessity are not unusual,\u201d of course, but a \nfederal \u201cjudiciary that licensed extraconstitutional gov-\nernment with each issue of comparable gravity would, in \nthe long run, be far worse.\u201d Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, \n561 U.S. 477, 501 (2010) (quoting New York v. United \nStates, 505 U.S. 144, 187-88 (1992)). \nNot only are Petitioners\u2019 amici\u2019s policy arguments ir-\nrelevant, moreover, they also are overstated. Nothing \nbars the President from nominating Task Force mem-\nbers for senatorial confirmation, which could be accom-\nplished via unanimous consent. And to the extent that the \nTask Force members\u2019 nominations may be controversial \nand so prompt greater debate in the Senate, that point \ncuts in favor of requiring their confirmation, not against \nit. \u201cThe Constitution\u2019s deliberative process was viewed \nby the Framers as a valuable feature, not something to \nbe lamented and evaded.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of \nAm. R.Rs., 575 U.S. 43, 61 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring) \n(citation omitted). \n\n4 \n \nThe federal government does not advance a persua-\nsive counterargument. It does not contend that Task \nForce members aren\u2019t officers. Rather, it argues that \nthey are inferior officers. That distinction is irrelevant to \nthis case. Under the Appointments Clause, the default \nrequirement that the President must nominate and the \nSenate must confirm applies until valid legislation \nchanges that default. Because Congress has not vested \nappointment \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of \nLaw, or in the Heads of Departments,\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nII, \u00a72, cl. 2, with respect to the Task Force, the only \nquestion the Court must answer is whether Task Force \nmembers are officers. Because the federal government \nconcedes (as it must) that they are, the Court need not \ndecide whether (i) they are principal officers and, (ii) if \nso, whether the provisions of statutory law that make \nthem principal officers can be severed as the federal gov-\nernment urges. In all events, severability would be espe-\ncially inappropriate here.  \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Need Not Decide Whether Task Force \nMembers Are Principal Officers. \nAlthough distinguishing between principal and infe-\nrior officers is sometimes necessary, the Court need not \ndo so here. Even if Task Force members are inferior of-\nficers, they still have not been properly appointed be-\ncause Congress has not by law departed from the default \nrule that the President nominates and the Senate con-\nfirms. If following the Constitution\u2019s language proves \ndifficult, Congress can amend the statutes to ensure that \nTask Force members are inferior officers whose appoint-\nment is vested in the President or a department head. \nAppeals to policy thus widely miss the mark.    \n\n5 \n \nA. The Appointments Clause safeguards liberty.  \n1.  Although the Bill of Rights helps protect liberty, \nthe Framers understood that \u201cmere parchment\u201d is not \nenough. The Federalist No. 73, at 441 (Alexander \nHamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). Rather than \nrelying on a list of rights, the Framers created the \nseparation of powers \u201cas the absolutely central \nguarantee of a just Government.\u201d Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 697 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). In so doing, \nthey \u201crecognized that, in the long term, structural \nprotections against abuse of power were critical to \npreserving liberty.\u201d Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 730 \n(1986).  \nArticle II vests \u201c[t]he executive Power,\u201d U.S. Const. \nart. II, \u00a71, cl. 1, in a single executive\u2014the President\u2014\nwho is compelled to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed,\u201d id. art. II, \u00a73. This vesting makes \u201cem-\nphatically clear from start to finish\u201d that the president is \n\u201cpersonally responsible for his branch.\u201d Akhil Reed \nAmar, America\u2019s Constitution: A Biography 197 (2005). \nThe Framers demanded \u201cunity in the Federal Execu-\ntive\u201d to guarantee \u201cboth vigor and accountability,\u201d \nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997), as well \nas \u201c[d]ecision, activity, secre[c]y, and d[i]spatch,\u201d 3 Jo-\nseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the \nUnited States \u00a71414, at 283 (1833). \u201c[B]ecause it would \nbe \u2018impossib[le]\u2019 for \u2018one man\u2019 to \u2018perform all the great \nbusiness of the State,\u2019 the Constitution assumes that \nlesser executive officers will \u2018assist the supreme Magis-\ntrate in discharging the duties of his trust.\u2019\u201d Seila L. LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 213 (2020) (quoting 30 Writings \nof George Washington 334 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1939)). \nBut the Constitution also provides important checks \non the President\u2019s power. Of particular significance, the \n\n6 \n \nConstitution \u201cgive[s] Congress broad authority to \nestablish and organize the Executive Branch.\u201d Id. at 266 \n(Kagan, J., concurring in judgment in part and \ndissenting in part). Although Article II speaks to the \nappointment \nof \ninferior \nofficers \nby \n\u201cHeads \nof \nDepartments,\u201d for example, nowhere does it create any \nsuch departments. U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. Thus, \n\u201c[a]lthough the Constitution contemplates\u201d federal \ndepartments and officers, \u201cit clearly requires that those \noffices \u2018shall be established by Law,\u2019\u201d meaning \u201can office \nthat Congress creates \u2018by statute.\u2019\u201d Trump v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 593, 645 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(first quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2; and then \nquoting Lucia, 585 U.S. at 254 (Thomas, J., concurring)).  \nThe Framers\u2019 decision to empower Congress to cre-\nate departments and almost all federal executive offices \nwas no accident. \u201cThe limitation on the President\u2019s \npower to create offices grew out of the Founders\u2019 expe-\nrience with the English monarchy,\u201d in which \u201c[t]he King \ncould wield significant power by both creating and filling \noffices as he saw fit\u201d\u2014thus allowing the Crown to \u201ccre-\nate a multitude of offices and then fill them with his sup-\nporters.\u201d Id. (citing, inter alia, Jennifer Mascott, Who \nAre \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d?, 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, \n492 (2018)). Abuses of this power so enraged the Colo-\nnists that they included the King\u2019s creation of a \u201cmulti-\ntude of New Offices\u201d in the Declaration of Independence \nitself. Id. at 646 (quoting The Declaration of Independ-\nence \u00b612 (U.S. 1776)).  \nCongress has long exercised authority to create and \nstructure federal departments. For example, in connec-\ntion with the famous Decision of 1789, the First Congress \ndetermined not only that the Department of Foreign Af-\nfairs would be headed by a Secretary, see An Act for \n\n7 \n \nestablishing an Executive Department, to be denomi-\nnated the Department of Foreign Affairs, Jul. 27, 1789, \nch. 4, 1 Stat. 28 \u00a71, but resolved that \u201c[h]e shall receive \nthe applications of all foreigners relative to his depart-\nment,\u201d and \u201cthe books, records, and other papers of the \nUnited States, that relate to this department, [should] be \ncommitted to his custody,\u201d id. \u00a71 n.(a); see also id. \u00a74 \n(\u201c[T]he Secretary \u2026 shall forthwith after his appoint-\nment, be entitled to have the custody and charge of all \nrecords, books and papers in the office.\u201d). Congress also \ndetermined that \u201cthere shall be in the said department, \nan inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal \nofficer,\u201d who would \u201cbe called the chief Clerk in the De-\npartment of Foreign Affairs,\u201d who, during the Secre-\ntary\u2019s \u201cvacancy,\u201d would \u201chave the charge and custody of \nall records, books and papers appertaining to the said de-\npartment.\u201d Id. \u00a72. \nOnce an office is created, the President\u2019s authority \nrespecting that office includes \u201ccontrolling those who \nexecute the laws.\u201d Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 492 \n(quoting 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789) (Joseph Gales ed., \n1834) (remarks of James Madison)). \u201cThe text and \nstructure of Article II provide the President with the \npower to control subordinates within the executive \nbranch.\u201d \nNeomi \nRao, \nRemoval: \nNecessary \nand \nSufficient for Presidential Control, 65 Ala. L. Rev. 1205, \n1215 (2014). Indeed, the President\u2019s authority to control \nthe Executive Branch includes a plenary removal power. \nSee, e.g., Seila L., 591 U.S. at 213-15; Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220, 250 (2021). Otherwise, the President could \nnot fulfill his duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.\u201d Seila L., 591 U.S. at 213 (quoting \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a73); see also Myers v. United States, \n272 U.S. 52, 117 (1926). But constitutional text, structure, \n\n8 \n \nand history also confirm that before that the President \ncan exercise such power, Congress must create the \nrelevant department and federal office. \n2.  Not only does the Constitution give Congress the \npower to create departments and offices, it also sets \nforth the process for appointing officers to those offices. \nBy design, that process checks federal power.  \nThe Appointments Clause was included to address \nthe \nfact \nthat \n\u201c[t]he \n\u2018manipulation \nof \nofficial \nappointments\u2019 had long been one of the American \nrevolutionary generation\u2019s greatest grievances\u201d and \n\u201cwas deemed \u2018the most insidious and powerful weapon of \neighteenth-century \ndespotism.\u2019\u201d \nFreytag \nv. \nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 883 (1991) (quoting Gordon \nWood, The Creation of The American Republic 1776-\n1787, at 79, 143 (1969)). The Clause provides that the \nPresident \nshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Con-\nsent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two \nthirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall \nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Con-\nsent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, \nother public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the \nsupreme Court, and all other Officers of the \nUnited States, whose Appointments are not \nherein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \nestablished by Law: but the Congress may by \nLaw vest the Appointment of such inferior Offic-\ners, as they think proper, in the President alone, \nin the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-\nments. \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. \nThis text makes several points clear. First, \nessentially \u201call officers of the United States are to be \n\n9 \n \nappointed in accordance with the Clause \u2026. No class or \ntype of officer is excluded because of its special \nfunctions.\u201d NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., 580 U.S. 288, 311 \n(2017) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting Buckley, 424 \nU.S. at 132); see also United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. \n508, 510 (1878) (\u201cThat all persons who can be said to hold \nan office \u2026 were intended to be included within one or \nthe other of these modes of appointment there can be but \nlittle doubt.\u201d). The provision\u2019s breadth confirms the \nFramers\u2019 \nunderstanding \n\u201cthat \nby \nlimiting \nthe \nappointment power, they could ensure that those who \nwielded it were accountable to political force and the will \nof the people.\u201d Freytag, 501 U.S. at 884.  \nSecond, the Senate plays a pivotal role. \u201cAlthough the \nFramers recognized the potential value of leaving the \nselection of officers to \u2018one man of discernment\u2019 rather \nthan to a fractious, multimember body, they also \nrecognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption \nposed by permitting one person to fill every office in the \nGovernment.\u201d SW Gen, 580 U.S. at 317 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring) (quoting The Federalist No. 76, at 510 \n(Alexander Hamilton) (J. Cooke ed., 1961)). The \nFramers thus \u201cempowered the Senate to confirm \nprincipal officers on the view that \u2018the necessity of [the \nSenate\u2019s] co-operation in the business of appointments \nwill be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the \nconduct of\u2019 the President.\u201d Id. (quoting The Federalist \nNo. 76, at 514). The Senate can prevent the President \nfrom appointing officers \u201cpossessing the necessary \ninsignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious \ninstruments of his pleasure.\u201d The Federalist No. 76, at \n456 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961). \nThis is an important \u201cprinciple of limitation.\u201d Freytag, \n501 U.S. at 884.  \n\n10 \n \nThird, the division of appointment authority between \nthe President and the Senate always applies to principal \nofficers, and, as a \u201cdefault,\u201d Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660, to \nany inferior officer. That default can only be changed if \nCongress by law vests such an appointment in one of \nthree designated entities: in \u201cthe President alone, in the \nCourts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\u201d U.S. \nConst. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. In other words, only legislation \nenacted by bicameralism and presentment can change \nthe default rule that the Senate must consent to \nessentially every appointment of an Executive Branch \nofficer.  \n \nThe federalism implications of the Appointments \nClause are readily apparent. Because of the Senate\u2019s \ncritical role in appointments, each State has an equal say \nin who is appointed because all States enjoy equal \nrepresentation in the Senate. See U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a73, \ncl. 1. Furthermore, the Senate can divest itself of its \nchecking power only if majorities in both Houses of \nCongress agree.  \n \nBicameralism and presentment\u2014the lawmaking \nprocess for Congress to vest appointment powers\u2014also \nprotect the States. \u201cEven the quickest look at the \nconstitutional structure reveals that the design of \nbicameralism and presentment disfavors easygoing, \nhigh[-]volume lawmaking. \u2026 [The] three institutions \nanswer to different constituencies, are selected at \n(mostly) different times, and are made independent of \none another\u2019s direct control.\u201d John F. Manning, \nLawmaking Made Easy, 10 Green Bag 2d 191, 198 \n(2007). And because state law is supreme absent \npreemption by federal law, see U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, \nthe inherent difficulty of bicameralism and presentment \nnecessarily \nprotects \nthe \nStates. \n\u201cThe \nFounders \n\n11 \n \nunderstood that the means established for adopting \nfederal law would have a direct impact on federalism\u201d \nand that \u201cfederal lawmaking procedures \u2026 preserve \nfederalism both by making federal law more difficult to \nadopt, and by assigning lawmaking power solely to \nactors subject to the political safeguards of federalism.\u201d \nBradford R. Clark, Separation of Powers as a Safeguard \nof Federalism, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 1321, 1323-24 (2001).  \n3. The Appointments Clause, however, also prompts \nquestions. For example, who is an \u201cOfficer[] of the \nUnited States,\u201d and within that group, who are \u201cinferior \nOfficers\u201d? U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. What bodies \nconstitute \u201cCourts of Law\u201d or \u201cDepartments,\u201d and \nwithin \u201cDepartments,\u201d who are \u201c[h]eads\u201d? Id.  \nThe Court has answered such questions. The Court\u2019s \ncurrent test for officer status asks whether the individual \n\u201coccup[ies] a \u2018continuing\u2019 position\u201d and \u201cexercis[es] \nsignificant authority pursuant to the laws of the United \nStates.\u201d Lucia, 585 U.S. at 245 (first quoting Germaine, \n99 U.S. at 511; and then quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n126); compare Mascott, supra, at 6 (urging a broader \ntest). The Court has advanced a couple of tests for \ninferior officers, one using a balancing approach and \nanother emphasizing supervision alone. Compare \nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 670-72, with Edmond, 520 U.S. at \n662-63. The Court has also indicated\u2014controversially\u2014\nthat Article I tribunals can be \u201cCourts of Law.\u201d Freytag, \n501 U.S. at 890. And of special relevance here, the Court \nhas defined a \u201cDepartment\u201d as \u201ca freestanding \ncomponent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to \nor contained within any other such component,\u201d and has \nheld that \u201cmultimember agencies\u201d can constitute \ndepartment heads. Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 511-12. \n\n12 \n \nAnother question is what remedies are available for \nviolations of the Appointments Clause. Actions taken by \nofficers who have not been empowered to act are \u201cvoid \nab initio.\u201d Collins, 594 U.S. at 257-58. This makes sense: \nBy definition, someone without a lawful appointment \ncannot \u201cexercise \u2026 power that the actor d[oes] not \nlawfully possess.\u201d Id. at 258 (citing, inter alia, Lucia, 585 \nU.S. at 251-52). In fact, to remedy Appointments Clause \nviolations with regard to certain proceedings, not only \nmust \u201ca new hearing\u201d take place \u201cbefore a properly \nappointed official,\u201d but that hearing must also occur \nbefore a different person (that is, not the previously \nunlawfully appointed official). Lucia, 585 U.S. at 251 \n(quotations omitted). Such strong medicine is necessary \nto vindicate the Constitution\u2019s safeguards on liberty.  \n4. Finally, the Court has set forth what effectively \namounts to an order of operations for resolving \nAppointments Clause challenges. Where Congress \nenacts a scheme that bestows appointment power \noutside of the bounds that the Appointments Clause \npermits, \nthe \nCourt \ncan \nassess \nthat \nscheme\u2019s \nconstitutionality by determining whether the appointed \nindividuals are officers. If the appointed individuals are \nofficers, such a scheme is unconstitutional per se.   \nThat is the lesson from Buckley. There, the Court \naddressed the constitutionality of the then-newly \nestablished Federal Election Commission. Congress \nvested appointment of two Commissioners in the \nPresident alone, but also two each in \u201cthe President pro \ntempore of the Senate\u201d and \u201cthe Speaker of the House \n[of Representatives].\u201d 424 U.S. at 126-27. Such a statute \ncould be constitutional only if the Commissioners were \nnot officers of the United States. Yet the Court reasoned \nthat because \u201ca postmaster first class, and the clerk of a \n\n13 \n \ndistrict court, are inferior officers of the United States \nwithin the meaning of the Appointments Clause, as they \nare, surely the Commissioners \u2026 are at the very least \nsuch \u2018inferior Officers\u2019 within the meaning of that \nClause.\u201d Id. at 126 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \nIn other words, the Court did not need to decide whether \nthe Commissioners were principal officers because it was \nsufficient that they were officers whose appointment had \nnot been lawfully vested.  \nB. Congress has not vested appointment of Task \nForce members in the Secretary.  \nNo one disputes that Task Force members are \nofficers whom the President did not nominate and the \nSenate did not confirm. As the federal government \nconcedes (at 3), \u201c[a]ll agree that Task Force members \nare officers of some kind, because they exercise \nsignificant, \ncontinuing \ngovernmental \nauthority.\u201d \nInstead, the parties disagree about whether Task Force \nmembers are principal or inferior officers. The Court \nneed not resolve that question because, even if those \nofficers are inferior, Congress never vested their \nappointment \u201cin the President alone, in the Courts of \nLaw, or in the Heads of Departments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nII, \u00a72, cl. 2. The \u201cdefault\u201d rule, Edmond, 520 U.S. at 660, \nthus applies\u2014presidential nomination followed by \nsenatorial confirmation. Because that indisputably did \nnot happen here, it does not matter whether Task Force \nmembers are principal or inferior officers because the \nfederal government\u2019s argument fails either way.  \n1. The Task Force is housed within the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which itself \nif housed within the Public Health Service, which in turn \nis part of the Department of Health and Human Services. \nSee, e.g., U.S.Br.3 (\u201cThe Task Force sits within the \n\n14 \n \nPublic Health Service, which is itself a component of \n[HHS].\u201d). AHRQ is managed by its own \u201cdirector,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7299(a), while the Public Health Service is \nmanaged by \u201cthe Assistant Secretary for Health,\u201d id. at \n\u00a7202; see also id. at \u00a7203 (\u201cThe Service shall consist of (1) \nthe Office of the Surgeon General, (2) the National \nInstitutes of Health, (3) the Bureau of Medical Services, \nand (4) the Bureau of State Services, and the [AHRQ].\u201d). \nA Senate-confirmed Secretary runs HHS. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a73501; 67 Stat. 631, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953, \n\u00a71.  \nSeveral statutory provisions are relevant to whether \nCongress has departed from the Appointment Clause\u2019s \ndefault rule with respect to the Task Force: \n(1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299b-4(a)(1) states that \u201c[t]he Director \n[of AHRQ] shall convene an independent \nPreventive Services Task Force \u2026 to be \ncomposed \nof \nindividuals \nwith \nappropriate \nexpertise.\u201d The statute does not provide a tenure \nterm for Task Force members but does provide \nthat \u201c[a]ll members of the Task Force \u2026, and any \nrecommendations made by such members, shall \nbe independent and, to the extent practicable, not \nsubject to political pressure.\u201d Id. at \u00a7299b-4(a)(6). \nAHRQ also \u201cshall provide ongoing administrative, \nresearch, and technical support for the operations \nof the Task Force.\u201d Id. at \u00a7299b-4(a)(3). \n(2) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299(a) provides that \u201c[t]here is \nestablished within the Public Health Service an \nagency to be known as the [AHRQ], which shall \nbe headed by a director appointed by the \nSecretary. The Secretary shall carry out this \nsubchapter acting through the Director.\u201d  \n\n15 \n \n(3) An uncodified statute from 1966 allows the \nSecretary to perform \u201call functions of the Public \nHealth Service \u2026 and of all other officers and \nemployees of the Public Health Service.\u201d 80 Stat. \n1610, Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966. That \nstatute, however, does \u201cnot apply to the functions \nvested by law in any advisory council \u2026 in the \nPublic Health Service.\u201d 80 Stat. 1610 \u00a71(b). \nNotably, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299b-4, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299(a), and \nthe 1966 statute are the only statutes that the federal \ngovernment identified to the Fifth Circuit to support its \ntheory that Congress departed from the Appointments \nClause\u2019s default rule with respect to the Task Force. See \nU.S.Opening.Br.30-35, Braidwood Mgmt., Inc. v. \nBecerra, 104 F.4th 930 (5th Cir. 2024) (No. 23-10326); see \nalso U.S.Resp.&Rep.Br.5-13, Braidwood, 104 F.4th 930 \n(No. 23-10326).  \n2. Because Task Force members indisputably are \nofficers whom the President did not nominate and the \nSenate did not confirm, the Court need not decide more \nbecause Congress has not vested their appointment \u201cin \nthe President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the \nHeads of Departments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. The \nCourt\u2019s order-of-operations analysis from Buckley \nshould be dispositive here. \nTo begin, Congress has not expressly authorized \nanyone to appoint Task Force members. Instead, by the \nfederal government\u2019s own account, \u201cCongress codified \nthe Task Force\u2019s role by expressly authorizing the \nDirector of [AHRQ], \u2026 to \u2018periodically convene\u2019 the Task \nForce.\u201d U.S.Br.5 (quoting Healthcare Research and \nQuality Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106-129, sec.2(a), \n\u00a7915(a)(1), 113 Stat. 1659). Allowing AHRQ\u2019s Director to \n\u201cconvene\u201d the Task Force does not remotely equate to \n\n16 \n \nappointing them. To \u201cconvene\u201d means \u201c[t]o call together, \nesp[ecially] for a formal meeting; to cause to assemble.\u201d \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024); see also Convene, \nCollins Dictionary (12th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cconvene\u201d as \n\u201cto gather, call together, or summon, esp. for a formal \nmeeting\u201d); \nConvene, \nCambridge \nDictionary, \nhttps://perma.cc/84U9-LTDS (defining \u201cconvene\u201d as \u201cto \nbring together a group of people for a meeting, or to \nmeet for a meeting\u201d); Convene, The American Heritage \nDictionary, \nhttps://perma.cc/39AA-J2C9 \n(defining \n\u201cconvene\u201d as \u201c1. [t]o cause to come together formally; \nconvoke\u201d and \u201c2. [t]o summon to appear, as before a \ntribunal\u201d). True, someone occupying a government role \ncannot be convened to do anything until he or she has \nbeen appointed, but convening itself is not appointment. \nSee, e.g., W. Pac. R.R. Corp. v. W. Pac. R.R. Co., 345 U.S. \n247, 273 (1953) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (\u201cIn cases of \nintracircuit conflict or other exceptional situations which \nactually demand the attention of the full court, the \njudges of a court should be trusted to convene on their \nown initiative.\u201d). \nThe distinction between appointing and convening, \nmoreover, is familiar to Congress. By statute, \u201cthe \nSecretary of State shall convene a Security Review \nCommittee\u201d should certain events arise, yet the \nSecretary does not appoint every member of the \nCommittee. 22 U.S.C. \u00a74831(a)(1)-(2). Likewise, \u201cthe \nSecretary of the military department concerned shall \nconvene selection boards,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7611, but \nappointment to those selection boards is addressed \nseparately, id. at \u00a7612. As Respondents demonstrated to \nthe Fifth Circuit in an extensive statutory appendix, such \ndistinctions between convening and appointing are \ncommon. See Appellees/Cross-Appellants.Appendix.008-\n\n17 \n \n099, Braidwood, 104 F.4th 930 (5th Cir. 2024) (No. 23-\n10326) (citing, inter alia, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7151(a), (g); 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7634c(b)(2)(A); 16 U.S.C. \u00a73951(9), \u00a73952(a)(1)-(2); 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a73168(a); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7107d-2(a)-(b); 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a71090(f)(3)(A); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7379dd(d)(1)(D)(i); 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a77302(b)(1), (d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7290ee-(5)(e)(1)-(2); 50 U.S.C. \n\u00a73022(b), (d)).  \n \nThe fact that Congress did not provide a statutory \nmethod to appoint Task Force members should not be \nsurprising. When Congress created the Task Force in \n1984, its members merely gave advice, and \u201cmembers of \na commission that has purely advisory functions need not \nbe officers of the United States.\u201d Constitutional \nLimitations on Federal Government Participation in \nBinding Arbitration, 19 Op. O.L.C. 208, 216 (1995) \n(quotation omitted); see also Cong. Rsch. Serv., R40856, \nThe Debate Over Selected Presidential Assistants and \nAdvisors: \nAppointment, \nAccountability, \nand \nCongressional Oversight at 22 n.110 (2014) (repeating \nview of Office of Legal Counsel). The Director therefore \ncould retain them as volunteers. That changed, however, \nfollowing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enactment in 2010, \nwhere \u201cCongress for the first time provided that some of \nthe Task Force\u2019s recommendations could have binding \nlegal effects.\u201d U.S.Br.6. If Congress wished to depart \nfrom the Constitution\u2019s longstanding default rule, at that \ntime it should have (i) made sure that Task Force \nmembers are not principal officers and (ii) vested their \nappointments in the President or HHS Secretary. \nCongress\u2019s decision not to do so is dispositive.   \n \nEven if the AHRQ Director\u2019s power to convene \nimplicitly carries with it the power to appoint, however, \nthat would not help the federal government. The AHRQ \nDirector is not a department head. Instead, all concede \n\n18 \n \nthat the AHRQ is a component of the Public Health \nService, which is a component of a cabinet-level agency. \nAccordingly, under Free Enterprise Fund, neither the \nAHRQ nor the Public Health Service is \u201ca freestanding \ncomponent of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to \nor contained within any other such component.\u201d 561 U.S. \nat 511. Yet the AHRQ Director\u2014not the HHS \nSecretary\u2014appointed the Task Force members. See, \ne.g., U.S.Opening.Br.5, Braidwood, 104 F.4th 930 (No. \n23-10326) (\u201cThe Task Force is currently composed of 16 \nmembers (selected by the HHS official who convenes the \nTask Force).\u201d); id. at 30 (\u201cAlthough the existing Task \nForce members have not yet received an appointment \nconsistent with the Appointments Clause, the Secretary \nhas authority to appoint Task Force members and is in \nthe process of providing them with a constitutional \nappointment.\u201d).  \n3. Before the Fifth Circuit, the federal government \ntried to avoid this constitutional infirmity by suggesting \nthat the Secretary\u2019s control over the AHRQ Director \nsatisfies the Appointments Clause. Id. at 30-35. Not so. \nCongress did not vest the appointment power for Task \nForce members in the Secretary, and lawyers for the \nExecutive Branch cannot rewrite the statute to say \notherwise. Congress alone decides whether to vest the \nappointment of inferior officers in department heads \nand, if so, in which department. Because Congress has \nnot \u201cby law\u201d vested appointment power in the Secretary, \nU.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2, the default rule governs. \nNor do 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299(a) or the 1966 statute help the \nfederal government. The Secretary may act \u201cthrough\u201d \nthe AHRQ Director, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299(a), or perform the \nfunctions \u201cof all other officers and employees of the \nPublic Health Service,\u201d 80 Stat. 1610. The AHRQ \n\n19 \n \nDirector, however, is not an officer or employee of the \nPublic Health Service; by statute, it is a separate entity \nthat is merely housed within the Public Health Service. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299(a). Accordingly, the 1966 statute is \nirrelevant.  \nRegardless, the Secretary acts \u201cthrough\u201d the AHRQ \ndirector; he does not become the AHRQ director. Id. \n(emphasis added). This distinction is a familiar one. The \nPresident acts through subordinate officials but does not \nbecome them. See, e.g., Seila L. LLC v. Consumer Fin. \nProt. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 204 (2020) (\u201c[T]he Framers \nexpected that the President would rely on subordinate \nofficers for assistance.\u201d). Instead, \u201c[i]n the case of \ninferior officers whose appointment is by law vested in \nthe heads of Departments, or in officers appointed by the \nPresident, he can only act indirectly by his authority \nover his own appointees.\u201d Removal of Assistant \nPostmaster of Washington, D.C., 17 Op. Att\u2019ys Gen. 475, \n475 (1882) (emphasis added); accord U.S. Const. art. II, \n\u00a72, cl. 1 (\u201cThe President \u2026 may require the Opinion, in \nwriting, of the principal Officer in each of the executive \nDepartments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of \ntheir \nrespective \nOffices.\u201d); \nThe \nPresident \nand \nAccounting Officers, 1 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 624, 625 (1823) \n(\u201c[I]t could never have been the intention of the \nconstitution, in assigning the general power to the \nPresident to take care that the laws be executed, that he \nshould in person execute them himself.\u201d). It could not be \notherwise: Per the Appointments Clause, there is a \ndistinction between \u201cthe President alone\u201d and \u201cthe \nHeads of Departments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2.  \nThe federal government\u2019s view that the Secretary \ncan appoint Task Force members because he supervises \nthe Public Health Service and the AHRQ has no limiting \n\n20 \n \nprinciple and would nullify the Appointments Clause. \nBecause \u201c[t]he executive Power\u201d\u2014in its entirety\u2014\u201cshall \nbe vested in a President,\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a71, every \npower lodged within the Executive Branch must be \nsubject to the President\u2019s supervision, see, e.g., Seila L., \n591 U.S. at 213. The Appointment Clause\u2019s reference to \n\u201cthe Heads of Departments,\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. \n2, would serve no purpose if the mere fact that anyone \nthat Congress vests with appointment authority is \nsubject to supervision were sufficient to satisfy the \nConstitution, because everyone in the Executive Branch \nis subject to the President\u2019s supervision. Unsurprisingly, \nthe Court has rejected such a theory. See Edmond, 520 \nU.S. at 658 (\u201cCongress could not give the Judge \nAdvocates General power to \u2018appoint\u2019 even inferior \nofficers of the United States; that power can be \nconferred only upon the President, department heads, \nand courts of law.\u201d). It should do so again here.  \nThe best contrary authority the federal government \noffered the Fifth Circuit was United States v. Hartwell, \n73 U.S. 385 (1867), where the Court addressed a statute \nproviding that \u201cthe assistant treasurer of the United \nStates at Boston is hereby authorized to appoint\u201d a clerk \n\u201cwith the approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury.\u201d \nGeneral Appropriations Act of July 23, 1866, ch. 208, 14 \nStat. 191, 202 (emphasis added). But that case proves \nRespondents\u2019 point. If Congress wishes to vest \nappointment power in an agency head, it says so. The \nlanguage of Hartwell\u2019s 1866 statute expressly provided \nthat the Secretary was the ultimate decisionmaker. See \n14 Stat. 202; Hartwell, 73 U.S. at 393. The statutes \nrelevant to this case contain no such language. \nAccordingly, the constitutional default rule applies.  \nEdmond confirms this point. Because Congress there \n\n21 \n \ndeclared that \u201c[t]he Secretary of Transportation may \nappoint and fix the pay of officers and employees of the \nDepartment of Transportation and may prescribe their \nduties and powers,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7323(a), a provision \nallowing a Judge Advocate General to \u201cassign\u201d military \njudges did not constitute the power to appoint, see \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 656-57. The federal government \npoints to no such language here vesting power in the \nSecretary.   \nFurthermore, the federal government\u2019s views are \ncontrary to HHS\u2019s practice. The AHRQ Director \nappointed the Task Force members. If some statute \nallows the Secretary to make such appointments, \nappointments by the AHRQ Director are inexplicable. It \nwas not until after this case was filed that the Secretary \npurported to ratify their appointments. See U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nHealth \n& \nHum. \nServs., \nRatification \nof \nPrior \nAppointment and Prospective Appointment Affidavit \n(2023), https://perma.cc/8TAA-7AMN. The Executive \nBranch\u2019s initial interpretation of the statutes should \nreceive more respect than its post hoc reinterpretation. \nAccord Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, \n386 (2024) (explaining that courts sometimes afford \n\u201crespect\u201d to \u201cExecutive Branch interpretation[s] \u2026 \nissued roughly contemporaneously with enactment of \nthe statute\u201d and that \u201cremain[] consistent over time\u201d).    \nC. The federal government\u2019s amici\u2019s policy \narguments are irrelevant and overstated.  \nThe federal government\u2019s amici fret that following \nthe Appointments Clause will result in bad policy. Even \nif that were true, the Court\u2019s duty is to the Constitution. \nHere, \nhowever, \npolicy \nconcerns \nare \nespecially \nmisplaced\u2014even apart from the fact that insurers often \n\n22 \n \ndo not need a mandate to cover preventive care.2 Because \nCongress has not vested appointment power elsewhere, \nthe Appointments Clause\u2019s default rule applies, meaning \nthat the President must nominate Task Force members \nto the Senate for confirmation. The President has not yet \nattempted to follow the Appointments Clause with \nrespect to these officers, but doing so would enable the \nTask Force to perform its statutory functions.  \n1. What is remarkable about almost all of the amicus \nbriefs filed in support of the federal government is how \nlittle law they offer. Instead, the briefs repeat the theme \nthat affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision will harm \npatients. \nFor \nexample, \nthe \nAmerican \nHospital \nAssociation begins its argument by announcing that \n\u201cpreventive-care services save lives, improve health, and \nreduce \nhealthcare \ncosts.\u201d \nAm.Hosp.Ass\u2019n.Br.6 \n(capitalization omitted). The brief of 48 Bipartisan \nEconomics and Other Social Science Scholars begins its \nargument by observing that \u201cthe preventive services \nprovision rests on sound economic principles specific to \npreventive \ncare.\u201d \nBipart.Econ.&Soc.Scholars.Br.5 \n(capitalization omitted). And the American Public Health \nAssociation\u2019s brief opens its argument by warning that \n\u201cthe Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling will cause Americans to \nsuffer \npreventable \nillness \nand \neven \ndeath.\u201d \nAm.Pub.Health.Br.5 (capitalization omitted). Not one of \nthose briefs, however, cites the Appointments Clause\u2014\nthe constitutional text before the Court.  \n \n2 See, e.g., Goth, supra (\u201cWhen [the nonprofit Employee Benefit \nResearch Institute] asked respondents for reasons why they would \ncontinue to provide preventive services at no cost to members, a \nnumber said covering preventive services in full \u2018incentivizes their \nuse, promotes better health, prevents more serious conditions, is in-\nsignificant in costs and saves money in the long term.\u2019\u201d). \n\n23 \n \nNo one disputes that expertise is important or that \nTask Force members may be able to help foster positive \nhealth outcomes. But this is a court of law. If Congress \nconcludes there is a policy problem, Congress can fix it. \nThe Court is not in the business of refereeing\u2014let alone \nresolving\u2014policy arguments. See, e.g., William H. \nRehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Tex. \nL. Rev. 693, 698 (1976) (rejecting \u201cthe proposition that \nfederal judges, perhaps judges as a whole, have a role of \ntheir own, quite independent of popular will, to play in \nsolving society\u2019s problems\u201d). The federal government\u2019s \namici should direct their efforts to the \u201celected \nrepresentatives across the street.\u201d Nat\u2019l Pork Producers \nCouncil v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 383 (2023). \n2. Policy arguments are especially inappropriate \nhere. Affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment would not \nmean that the Task Force cannot function, much less \nthat health-care expertise will be lacking. Instead, before \nthe Task Force members can act as officers, the \nPresident must nominate and the Senate must confirm \nthem. No statute prevents the President from sending \nthe members\u2019 nominations to the Senate. When \nCongress gave the Task Force additional powers in 2010, \nsee \nU.S.Br.6, \nthat \nenactment \ntriggered \nthe \nSenate-confirmation requirement, but Congress never \nblocked the President\u2019s ability to submit nominations to \nthe Senate.3  \nThe federal government\u2019s amici\u2019s policy arguments \nthus rest on the premise that presidential nomination \n \n3 Because Congress has not vested appointment of Task Force \nmembers in any Executive Branch official, the Court need not de-\ncide in this case whether a president could cure an unconstitutional \nvesting of appointment power in an agency official other than a de-\npartment head by nominating a person for Senate confirmation. \n\n24 \n \nand senatorial confirmation is unrealistic. Yet this \nprocess \nis \nubiquitous. \n\u201c[A]pproximately \n45,000 \nnominations are received by the Senate each two-year \nCongress.\u201d Hearing on Senate Procedures to Confirm \nNominees Before the S. Rules & Admin. Comm. 1 (Jul. \n30, 2024) (statement of Elizabeth Rybicki, Spec. on Cong. \n& the Legis. Process), https://perma.cc/KJE4-J7RA. \nAlthough some nominees, especially for high-profile \npositions, occasionally must wait a long time to be \nconfirmed, many do not. Congress confirms thousands of \nnominations through unanimous consent. Id. at 2 \n(\u201cNominations \nsupported \nby \nthe \ncommittee \nof \njurisdiction are most often taken up and approved by the \nfull Senate without a roll call vote.\u201d). If Congress \ndetermines, moreover, that the process is unduly \nonerous, it can amend the statutes regarding these \nofficers to ensure that they are inferior officers and vest \ntheir appointment in the Secretary. \nImplicit in the federal government\u2019s amici\u2019s appeals \nto policy, therefore, is apprehension that confirmation \nfor Task Force members in particular may be difficult. \nSuch apprehension should give the Court pause. One \nexplanation for why some amici may fear that Senate \nconfirmation would not be quick and easy, after all, is \nthat the Task Force must reconcile coverage mandates \nwith religious liberty. Concerns about how to do that are \nat the heart of a significant public debate. The Senate\u2014\nthrough confirmation or vesting of appointment power \nvia bicameralism and presentment\u2014should play a role in \nthat debate. In short, because Congress changed the \nplaying field when it made Task Force members officers \nby empowering them to create binding obligations, the \nSenate\u2019s federalism-protecting function governs.  \n\n25 \n \nII. Severability Is Irrelevant and Misplaced. \nThe federal government and some amici urge the \nCourt to remedy the Appointments Clause violation by \n\u201csevering\u201d pieces of the statutory scheme. Such slicing \nand dicing would not help Petitioners because Congress \nnever vested appointment power in the Secretary. Nor \nwould severing the statutes be proper in any event. \nWhatever role severability may play in other cases, it \ndoes not allow courts to refashion this particular scheme. \nA. Severability is irrelevant to the principal-\nvs.-inferior question.  \nAt the outset, any severability question is irrelevant \nto \nwhether \nCongress \nhas \ndeparted \nfrom \nthe \nAppointments Clause\u2019s default rule with respect to Task \nForce \nmembers. \nThe \nproblem \nfor \nthe \nfederal \ngovernment is not that Congress has said too much, but \nthat it has said too little. Under the Appointments \nClause, Congress must affirmatively act by statute to \nvest power to appoint inferior officers \u201cin the President \nalone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \nDepartments.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a72, cl. 2. Because \nCongress has not done so, no amount of severing can \nallow \nthe \nSecretary \nto \nratify \nor \nmake \nthese \nappointments. Instead, the default rule applies whatever \nconstitutional status Task Force members enjoy.  \nNor would severing parts of this statutory structure \ncomport with the Appointments Clause. Even if \nCongress had vested the power to appoint Task Force \nmembers in the AHRQ Director, no amount of severing \nwould allow the Court to transform that statute into a \nvesting of power in the Secretary. Not only is that not \nwhat the statutes say, but the rule that Congress can \nvest appointment only in department heads would serve \nno purpose if the judiciary could refashion statutes \n\n26 \n \nvesting appointment powers in someone who is not a \ndepartment head into a statute vesting such powers in a \ndepartment head. And in any event, that kind of \napproach would not work here because\u2014even if a power \nto convene is a power to appoint\u2014the very statute that \nallows the AHRQ Director to convene the Task Force is \nthe statute that creates the Task Force. If the AHRQ \nDirector were severed from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7299b-4(a)(1), \nthere no longer would be a Task Force to speak of. The \nCourt thus cannot sever those provisions.   \nB. Expansive theories of severability are \nespecially inappropriate here.  \nThe Court should be wary of expansive severability \ntheories for this particular statutory scheme for other \nreasons. The Court has severed provisions where \nCongress placed an unconstitutional removal restriction \nin a statute. See, e.g., Seila L., 591 U.S. at 238. The Court \nhas done the same where a principal officer could become \nan inferior office with only a small statutory excision. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 25 (2021). \nThese decisions are controversial. See, e.g., Seila L., 591 \nU.S. at 2552 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part); Arthrex, \n591 U.S. at 28 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting in part); accord \nChristopher J. Walker, What Arthrex Means for the \nFuture of Administrative Adjudication: Reaffirming \nthe Centrality of Agency-Head Review, Yale J. on Reg. \nNotice \n& \nComment \n(Jun. \n21, \n2021) \nhttps://perma.cc/M6SH-K59C (\u201c[I]t would be aggressive \nto judicially restructure the statutory review scheme to \ngrant agency-head review\u2014something that seems \ncontrary to pretty clear congressional intent.\u201d). \nThe Court should not extend such precedents here. \nIn addition to general concerns about the nature of the \njudicial power and the difficulty of ascertaining what \n\n27 \n \nCongress would have intended, this particular scheme\u2019s \nstructure counsels against such an approach.  \nFirst, the point of creating this Task Force was for it \nto do something different than what the Secretary does. \nIf Congress wanted the Secretary to make the decisions \nthat the Task Force would make, Congress would not \nhave placed the power in a Task Force housed in one \nspecialized body (AHRQ), which itself nests within \nanother specialized body (Public Health Service). Nor \nwould Congress say not only that the Task Force \u201cshall \nbe independent,\u201d but also that it \u201cshall be \u2026, to the \nextent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7299b-4(a)(6). The Court has not extended \nseverability so far as to disregard such a clear statement \nfrom Congress. \nThe statutory severing that the federal government \nproposes, moreover, is unorthodox. The federal \ngovernment does not urge the Court to sever 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7299b-4(a)(1) in its entirety, but only as applied \u201cto Task \nForce \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 recommendations.\u201d U.S.Br.40. Yet \ncourts cannot sever statutes only in certain applications. \nDoing so would be in obvious tension with an \n\u201celementary rule of statutory interpretation: the rule \nagainst \u2018[a]scribing various meanings to a single \niteration\u2019 of a statutory term in different applications.\u201d \nIn re Woolsey, 696 F.3d 1266, 1277 (10th Cir. 2012) \n(Gorsuch, J.) (following Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 \nU.S. 135, 143 (1994)). The Court has \u201creject[ed] \u2018the \ndangerous principle that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005)). \nSecond, this is not a case where the law cannot work \nabsent severability. Instead, reading the statutes to \nmean what they say would simply result in the President \n\n28 \n \nnominating Task Force members to the Senate for \nconfirmation. Similar congressionally created bodies \nrequire that very process.4 Put differently, the relevant \nstatutes are not unconstitutional\u2014the only actions that \nviolate the Appointments Clause are the Executive \nBranch\u2019s failure to abide by this statutory scheme.  \nThere is thus no need to sever. The laws on the books \nalready allow presidential nomination and senatorial \nconfirmation\u2014the Constitution\u2019s default rule. The \nPresident, however, has not nominated Task Force \nmembers. The Court should not sever statutory \nprovisions \nto \nexcuse \nthe \nExecutive \nBranch\u2019s \nnoncompliance with a perfectly constitutional law. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a71465c(a) (\u201cThe Advisory Board [for Cuba \nBroadcasting] shall consist of nine members, appointed by the Pres-\nident by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d); id. \n\u00a72511(c)(2)(A) (\u201cThe [Peace Corps National Advisory] Council shall \nconsist of fifteen voting members who shall be appointed by the \nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d); 33 \nU.S.C. \u00a7982(b) (\u201cThere is established the Advisory Board of the \nGreat Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation which \nshall be composed of five members appointed by the President, by \nand with the advice and consent of the Senate \u2026.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., No. 24-1367 (4th Cir.).  \nThis brief draws on that experience in support of the \nRespondents\u2019 position that the members of the U.S. \nPreventative Services Task Force function as \nprincipal officers without a proper appointment.  It \npresents a unique perspective tying together this \nCourt\u2019\u200as recent cases on officer status to demonstrate \nthat principal officer review has been consistently \nrequired for decisions by inferior officers that would \notherwise bind the Executive Branch.  This review \nrequirement was recently affirmed in United States v. \nArthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021).  This brief also points \nto Appointments Clause challenges to Executive \nBranch adjudications litigated by PLF in which lower \ncourts \nhave \nignored \nArthrex \nand \npermitted \nadjudications to proceed in the absence of principal \nofficer review.  \nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 23 \n(2021), established that only officers appointed as \nprincipal officers could make final, binding, and \nunreviewable adjudicative decisions for the Executive \nBranch.  This case provides the Court with an \nopportunity to affirm its holding in Arthrex and \nextend \nthat \nrule \nto \nall \nfinal, \nbinding, \nand \nunreviewable decisions of the Executive Branch.  For \ninferior officers making decisions that bind the \nExecutive Branch, principal officer review is the \n\n \n3 \nnecessary means to ensure that the chain of command \nestablished by the Appointments Clause is observed. \nArthrex considered the officer status of inferior \nofficer administrative patent judges (\u201cAPJ\u201d) who \nmade binding decisions on patentability, but were \nremoval protected and could not have their decisions \nreviewed by a principal officer.  To determine the \nAPJs\u2019 officer status, the Court evaluated whether they \nwere sufficiently directed and supervised by a \nprincipal \nofficer \ngiven \nthe \nnature \nof \ntheir \nresponsibilities. The Court concluded that, in \nadjudications, \u201c[o]nly an officer properly appointed to \na principal office may issue a final decision binding \nthe Executive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 23.  Because no \nprincipal officer had the ability to review APJs\u2019 \ndecisions, the APJs were not sufficiently supervised \nby a principal officer given their responsibilities. This \nsame logic can be extended to all binding decisions \nmade by inferior officers for the Executive Branch, \nwhich \ncannot \nbe \ncountermanded \nwithout \nthe \navailability of principal officer review. \nPetitioners emphasize the importance of at-will \nremoval as a supervisory tool. But when binding \ndecisions are at issue, the ability of a principal officer \nto remove an inferior officer at will is insufficient \nsupervision without principal officer review.  While \nremoval is an essential tool to ensure the faithful \nexecution of the laws, it does not sufficiently preserve \nthe Appointments Clause\u2019s chain of command when \nbinding decisions are involved.  That is so because \nremoval does not permit a principal officer to reverse \na final, binding decision of an inferior officer; it only \nauthorizes the termination of that inferior officer after \nthe fact.  So, removal is ultimately ineffective at \nensuring that the binding decisions of the Executive \n\n \n4 \nBranch are subject to the political accountability the \nAppointments Clause requires.  Indeed, Arthrex \nrejected the elimination of a removal restriction as \nsufficient oversight for APJs, instead leaving the \nremoval protection in place and removing the \nrestriction on principal officer review.  \nAt issue here are the members of the U.S. \nPreventative Services Task Force who make final, \nbinding, decisions for the Executive Branch as to the \npreventative services that private health insurers \nmust cover.  But Task Force members are not \nappointed as principal officers.2  And Congress did not \nprovide a means for the Secretary to substantively \nreview the Task Force\u2019s decisions. Arthrex effectively \ndecides \nthat \nthis \narrangement \nviolates \nthe \nAppointments Clause.  Like the APJ decisions, Task \nForce decisions are binding on the Executive Branch \nand non-reviewable.  As such, Arthrex requires that \nthe official making these decisions be appointed as a \nprincipal officer.  Since they are not, the Task Force \nmembers are unconstitutionally appointed. The U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit should be \naffirmed on this point. \nShould the Court decide that Arthrex does not \napply beyond Executive Branch adjudications, it \nshould still take this opportunity to clarify that final, \nbinding decisions in Executive Branch adjudications \nmust be made by a principal officer or subject to \nprincipal \nofficer \nreview. \n \nIn \npost-Arthrex \nAppointments Clause challenges to administrative \nadjudications, lower courts have cabined Arthrex to its \nfacts and relied on Edmond\u2019s consideration of removal \n \n2 Amicus does not take a position on whether Task Force \nmembers were properly appointed as inferior officers. \n\n \n5 \nand administrative oversight to uphold adjudication \nschemes that lack the dispositive requirement of \nprincipal officer review.  Lower courts\u2019 evasion of \nArthrex in adjudication cases should not be allowed to \ncontinue. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nDecisions binding the Executive Branch \nmust be made by a principal officer \nA. The Appointments Clause establishes a \nchain of command for Executive Branch \nofficers \nThe Appointments Clause\u200a sets out the means of \nappointment for Officers of the United States and in \ndoing so establishes a two-tiered chain of command. \nThe President is authorized to appoint \u201cOfficers of the \nUnited States\u201d with the \u201cAdvice and Consent of the \nSenate\u201d.  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.  This is the \nexclusive method of appointment for principal \nofficers\u2014officers who wield substantial executive \npower with no superior other than the President\u2014and \nthe default method of appointment for all officers.  \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 12.  The Appointments Clause \nprovides an alternative method of appointment for \ninferior officers\u2014less-powerful officers supervised by \nprincipal officers.  Id. at 12-13; Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 663 (1997).  For inferior officers, \nCongress may \u201cvest the[ir] Appointment\u201d \u201cin the \nPresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads \nof Departments.\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. \nThe \u201cclear and effective chain of command\u201d \nestablished by the Appointments Clause provides \nlegitimacy to the exercise of Executive Power and \nensures \u201caccountability to the public.\u201d  Arthrex, 594 \n\n \n6 \nU.S. \nat \n11 \n(citation \nomitted). \n \nLegitimacy, \naccountability, and quality are all essential for the \nexercise of the significant authority for which all \nofficers are responsible.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 11-\n12. \nFor the chain of command to be maintained \u201cthe \nnature of [an officer\u2019s] responsibilities\u201d must be \n\u201cconsistent with [his] method of appointment.\u201d \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  To evaluate this consistency, \nthe \nCourt \nconsiders \nan \nofficer\u2019s \nmethod \nof \nappointment with his functions and with the \nsupervision over him by other officers.  See, e.g., id. at \n13-18.  \u201cAn inferior officer must be \u2018directed and \nsupervised at some level by others who were \nappointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 13. (quoting \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 663).  The requisite level of \nsupervision for an inferior officer is determined by the \ntype of responsibilities the officer carries out.  Ibid. \nB. Binding \ndecisions \nfor \nthe \nExecutive \nBranch made by inferior officers must be \nsubject to principal officer review \nThe officer-level function at issue in this case is \nthe issuance of decisions that bind the Executive \nBranch.  This type of decision was recently addressed \nin Arthrex in the context of Executive Branch \nadjudications. \n \nArthrex \nconcluded \nthat, \nin \nadjudications, \u201c[o]nly an officer properly appointed to \na principal office may issue a final decision binding \nthe Executive Branch.\u201d  594 U.S. at 23.  The logic of \nArthrex extends to all binding decisions of the \nExecutive Branch, making Arthrex the relevant rubric \nfor evaluating the sufficiency of supervision for any \nofficer making such decisions.   \n\n \n7 \nArthrex considered the officer status of APJs in \nthe Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d).  Id. at 8.  \nAPJs were PTO adjudicators appointed as inferior \nofficers by the Secretary of Commerce and authorized \nto issue final, binding decisions for the Executive \nBranch in adversarial inter partes patent review \nproceedings.  Id. at 8-9.  APJs could only be removed \nfor cause.  Id. at 17.  And the PTO Director was \nstatutorily prohibited from reviewing the APJs\u2019 \npatentability decisions.  Id. at 14.  The question before \nthe Court was whether the APJs were sufficiently \nsupervised by the principal officer PTO Director to \nmake binding decisions on patent validity as inferior \nofficers.  Id. at 14-15.   \nTo analyze this question, the Court turned to \nEdmond, the source of the direction-and-supervision \ntest for determining whether an officer was a principal \nor inferior officer.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  Edmond \nconsidered the inferior officer status of Coast Guard \nCourt of Criminal Appeals judges by reviewing \nwhether:  (1) the judges were subject to procedural \nrules or other administrative oversight mechanisms \ncontrolled by a superior officer, (2) the judges were \nremovable at will, and (3) the judges\u2019 decisions were \nreviewed by a superior officer such that they could not \n\u201crender a final decision on behalf of the United States \nunless permitted to do so by other Executive officers.\u201d  \n520 U.S. at 664-65.   \nAccording to the Court, the Court of Criminal \nAppeals judges were administratively overseen and \nremovable \u201cwithout cause\u201d by the Judge Advocate \nGeneral, and certain of their decisions were reviewed \nby the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which \nwas composed of principal officers.  Ibid.  This \narrangement provided sufficient supervision for the \n\n \n8 \njudges to be constitutionally appointed as inferior \nofficers.  Id. at 666.  Among the three considerations, \n\u201c[w]hat [was] significant\u201d for inferior officer status \nwas that the judges\u2019 decisions were reviewable by a \nprincipal officer.  Id. at 665. \nIn \nArthrex, \nthe \nCourt \napplied \nEdmond\u2019s \nconclusion that principal officer review was the \nparamount factor for determining inferior officer \nstatus, and made it a necessity for Executive Branch \nadjudications.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14-18.  Arthrex \nsingled out the availability of principal officer review \nfor the judges in Edmond as the key difference with \nthe APJs, noting that for APJs this \u201c\u2018significant\u2019\u201d \nfactor was \u201cabsent.\u201d  Id. at 14.  Therefore, because the \nAPJs\u2019 decisions were not reviewable by the PTO \nDirector, \nthe \nCourt \nheld \nthat \ntheir \nfinal \ndecisionmaking authority was inconsistent with their \nappointment as inferior officers. Id. at 14-15, 23.  \nThe logic of Arthrex extends beyond inter partes \nreview adjudications to all officers and government \nemployees functioning as officers who make final, \nbinding, and unreviewable decisions for the Executive \nBranch.3  After all, the key feature of adjudicative \ndecisions that drove the outcome in Arthrex\u2014their \nbinding nature on the Executive Branch\u2014is not \nlimited \nto \nadjudications. \n \nLegislative \nrules \npromulgated through the Administrative Procedure \nAct\u2019s \nnotice-and-comment \nrulemaking \nprocess \n \n3 Arthrex declined to establish an \u201c\u2018exclusive criterion\u2019 for \ndistinguishing between principal and inferior officers\u201d when \nevaluating officers \u201coutside the context of adjudication\u201d where \n\u201cdecisions by inferior officers do not bind the Executive Branch \nto exercise power in a particular manner.\u201d  Id. at 23 (emphasis \nadded). \n\n \n9 \nproduce rules that have the \u201cforce and effect of law.\u201d  \nPerez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) \n(citation omitted).  And the Executive Branch is bound \nby such rules, the same as the regulated party, until \nthe agency changes the rules through another round \nof notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See id. at 95.  The \nbinding effect of these non-adjudicative final decisions \nof the Executive Branch similarly necessitates they be \nmade by a principal officer.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at \n23.  \nThe historical analysis in Arthrex confirms that its \nlogic extends beyond adjudications.  In 1792, \nAlexander Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, \nannounced the necessity of the principal officer\u200a\u2019s \n\u201cright to judge and direct\u201d\u2014in this case the customs \nofficials executing his instructions\u2014to \u201censur[e] that \n\u2018the responsibility for a wrong construction rests with \nthe head of the department, when it proceeds from \nhim.\u2019\u201d  594 U.S. at 18-19.  Additionally, an \u201c[e]arly \ncongressional statute[]\u201d subjected the issuance of \nliquor licenses \u201c\u2018to the superintendence, control and \ndirection of the department of the treasury\u2019\u201d thereby \n\u201cempower[ing a] department head[] to supervise the \nwork of [his] subordinates.\u201d  Id. at 19 (citation \nomitted).  Both examples reflect an early focus on \nprincipal officer control of decisionmaking beyond \nadjudications.  \nC. Removal is insufficient supervision for an \ninferior officer who makes final, binding, \nand unreviewable decisions \nPetitioners emphasize at-will removal as the \n\u201cmost potent\u201d supervision mechanism for inferior \nofficers.  Pet. Br. at 20.  But while important, at-will \nremoval cannot replace principal officer review as a \n\n \n10 \nnecessary supervisory tool for an inferior officer to \nissue binding decisions.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 26 \n(Roberts, C.J., plurality opinion).  Principal officer \nreview ensures that the \u201cchain of command\u201d \nestablished by the Appointments Clause in these \ncircumstances is maintained by providing the \nprincipal officer a \u201cmeans of countermanding\u201d an \ninferior officer\u200a\u2019s decision.  Id. at 16, 18.  In contrast, \nremoval is a blunt instrument that can only be used \nafter the fact without effect on the inferior officer\u200a\u2019s \ndecisions.  See id. at 16-17. \nThis Court has consistently reasoned that \nremoval does not provide sufficient supervision for an \ninferior officer to make binding decisions without \nreview by a principal officer.  Edmond itself \n\u201crecognized\u201d removal as \u201ca powerful tool for control\u201d \nover the inferior officer judges.  520 U.S. at 664.  But \nthe Court acknowledged that this control was \u201cnot \ncomplete.\u201d  Ibid.  The Judge Advocated General with \nat-will removal power was prohibited from influencing \nthe judges\u2019 decisions through threats of removal and \n\u201cha[d] no power to reverse decisions of the court.\u201d  \nIbid.  So, Edmond went on to evaluate whether there \nwas a principal officer who had review authority.  Id. \nat 664-65. Only after the Court determined there was \ndid it conclude that the judges were properly \nappointed as inferior officers. Id. at 665-66. \nFree Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, \n485, 510 (2010), reapplied the relevance of principal \nofficer review to the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board that issued rules and conducted its \nown disciplinary proceedings.  There, the Court had \n\u201cno hesitation in concluding that under Edmond the \nBoard members [were] inferior officers\u201d based on the \nability of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n\n \n11 \n(i.e., principal officers) to remove them at will and \n\u201cgiven the Commission\u200a\u2019s other oversight authority.\u201d  \n561 U.S. at 510 (emphasis added).  That other \nauthority included the ability of the Commission to \napprove or alter the rules issued by and the sanctions \nimposed by the Board\u2014in other words, principal \nofficer review.  Id. at 486, 504. \nArthrex continued this line of precedent. In \nholding that the APJs were functioning without a \nproper \nappointment, \nthe \nCourt \nrepeatedly \nemphasized that the primary consideration for \ninferior officer status was whether they could issue \nbinding decisions without review by anyone in the \nExecutive Branch.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14; id. at 17 \n(APJ power \u201cconflicts with the design of the \nAppointments Clause\u201d because of \u201cthe insulation of \n[their] decisions from any executive review\u201d); id. at 23 \n(\u201c[T]he unreviewable authority wielded by APJs . . . is \nincompatible with their appointment by the Secretary \nto an inferior office.\u201d); id. at 27 (Roberts, C.J., plurality \nopinion) (\u201cThe Constitution [] forbids the enforcement \nof statutory restrictions on the Director that insulate \nthe decisions of APJs from his direction and \nsupervision.\u201d).  \nThe Court\u2019s remedy in Arthrex confirmed the \nnecessity of principal officer review for binding \ndecisions.  While below, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit decided to eliminate the removal \nrestriction on APJs, this Court disagreed and instead \neliminated the statutory restriction on principal \nofficer review.  Id. at 24-26 (Roberts, C.J., plurality \nopinion).  It adopted this remedy because \u201creview by \nthe \nDirector \nbetter \nreflects \nthe \nstructure \nof \nsupervision within the PTO and the nature of APJs\u2019 \nduties.\u201d  Id. at 26; see also id. at 27 (\u201c[T]he source of \n\n \n12 \nthe constitutional violation is the restraint on the \nreview authority of the Director.\u201d).  Notably, the Court \nleft the APJs\u2019 removal restriction in place.  Id. at 26.  \nThree of the dissenting Justices concurred in this \nremedy, agreeing with the majority that the \n\u201cstatutory scheme is defective only because the APJ\u200a\u2019s \ndecisions are not reviewable by the Director alone.\u201d  \nId. at 44 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part).  This remedy is all but conclusive that, \nwithout \nprincipal \nofficer \nreview, \nremoval \nis \ninsufficient supervision for an inferior officer making \nbinding decisions. \nII. Task Force members function as principal \nofficers without a proper appointment \nAt issue here is the application of Arthrex to the \nmembers of the Task Force.  The Task Force is nested \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services \nas part of the Public Health Service\u2019s Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (\u201cAHRQ\u201d).  Pet. Br. \nat 5.  The Task Force is \u201cconvene[d]\u201d by the Director \nof AHRQ, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1), who is appointed \nby the Secretary, id. \u00a7 299(a).  There is no statutory \nrestriction on members\u2019 removal.  See id. \u00a7 299b-4(a). \nThe Task Force is responsible for developing \nrecommendations for \u201cbest practice\u201d in clinical \npreventative services based on the \u201ceffectiveness, \nappropriateness, and cost-effectiveness\u201d of such \nservices.  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(1).  These recommendations \nare \u201cpublished in the Guide to Clinical Preventative \nServices.\u201d  Ibid.  Congress also required that the Task \nForce members and their recommendations \u201cbe \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not subject \nto political pressure.  Id. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6). \n\n \n13 \nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Affordable Care \nAct, which established for health insurers minimum \ncoverage requirements for preventative services.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13.  Among the services health \ninsurers were required to cover were those given \u201ca \nrating of \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019\u201d by the Task Force, making Task \nForce recommendations binding decisions of the \nExecutive Branch for purposes of the coverage \nrequirement.  Id. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1).  Congress also \nempowered the States to impose these coverage \nrequirements on health insurers and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to impose civil money \npenalties on plans that fail to meet them.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 300gg-22.  The Task Force recommendations are the \nlaw health insurers must follow and the Executive \nBranch must enforce until the Task Force undertakes \nanother review to update its recommendations.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(2).  Congress granted the \nSecretary only a limited role in these decisions to \n\u201cestablish a minimal interval\u201d between the date of the \nTask Force\u2019s recommendation and its effective date for \nthe coverage mandate.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). \nThis arrangement violates the Appointments \nClause because Task Force members are making \nbinding decisions for the Executive Branch with \nneither a principal officer appointment nor the \navailability of principal officer review. See Arthrex, \n594 U.S. at 23. It is indisputable that Task Force \nmembers are not appointed as principal officers \nbecause they are \u201cconvene[d]\u201d by the AHRQ Director. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4. The Secretary is also statutorily \nforeclosed from substantively reviewing the binding \nTask Force recommendations. See id. \u00a7 300gg-13(b). \nCongress included no substantive review mechanism \nfor the Secretary. Id. The fact that Congress \n\n \n14 \nproscribed a role for the Secretary in setting the \ntiming of the recommendations\u2019 effective date \ndemonstrates that this was intentionally omitted.  See \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457, \n471 (2001).  This conclusion is reinforced by \nCongress\u2019\u200as pre-ACA command that Task Force \nmembers and their recommendations \u201cshall be \nindependent and, to the extent practicable, not subject \nto political pressure.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6).  \nThrough these two statutes, Congress designed the \nTask Force to be free of political influence through \nreview of its recommendations by the Secretary, and \nCongress maintained that design when it made Task \nForce recommendations binding on health insurers \nwithout review by the Secretary.  \nWithout principal officer review, removal is \ninsufficient supervision for the non-principal officer \nTask Force members to make binding decisions for the \nExecutive Branch.  See Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 23.  The \nSecretary has no ability to countermand the binding \ndecisions of the Task Force members, the essential \nsupervisory mechanism under these circumstances. \nId. at 16-17; see also supra Part I.C.  So, the Task \nForce \nmembers \nthemselves \nare \nissuing \n\u201cfinal \ndecision[s] binding the Executive Branch,\u201d a function \nthat \u201c[o]nly an officer properly appointed to a principal \noffice may\u201d do.  Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 23.  This structure \nviolates the Appointments Clause.  See ibid.  \nIII. Lower courts have failed to apply Arthrex to \nother Executive Branch adjudications \nEven if the Court concludes that Arthrex is \ninapplicable to the Task Force, it should preserve and \nclarify \nits \napplicability \nto \nExecutive \nBranch \nadjudications.  594 U.S. at 19-23.  When Arthrex \n\n \n15 \nreserved for future cases the establishment of a \ncriterion for inferior officer status, it specifically \nreferred to cases \u201coutside the context of adjudication.\u201d  \nId. at 23.  Arthrex referred to principal officer review \nas the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d for adjudication.\u201d  Id. at 21.  \nAnd during the oral argument, the government \nacknowledged that \u201cit \u2018certainly is the norm\u2019 for \nprincipal officers to have the capacity to review \ndecisions made by inferior adjudicative officers.\u201d  Id. \nat 20.  Arthrex at least stands for the proposition that \nfinal, \nbinding \ndecisions \nin \nExecutive \nBranch \nadjudications must be made or subject to review by a \nprincipal officer.  Id. at 23. \nSince Arthrex, lower courts have failed to apply \nthe requirement of principal officer review of \notherwise binding decisions to other Executive Branch \nadjudications.  For example, in Appointments Clause \nchallenges to the structure of U.S. Department of \nAgriculture \n(\u201cUSDA\u201d) \nadjudications \nof \nalleged \nviolations of the Horse Protection Act, two district \ncourts have upheld the final, binding decisionmaking \nauthority of USDA\u200a\u2019s Judicial Officer\u2014who was not \nappointed as a principal officer\u2014while acknowledging \nthe \nunavailability \nof \nprincipal \nofficer \nreview.  \nMcConnell v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., No. 4:23-CV-24, \n2023 WL 5963782, at *4 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2023); \nManis v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 731 F.Supp.3d 685, 692-\n93 (M.D.N.C. 2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-1367 (4th \nCir. Apr. 25, 2024).4  \nMcConnell concluded that the Secretary of \nAgriculture\u200a\u2019s administrative oversight over and \nability to remove at will the Judicial Officer was \n \n4 Pacific Legal Foundation was counsel for the plaintiff in each \ncase. \n\n \n16 \nsufficient supervision for the Judicial Officer not to \nhave received a principal officer appointment.  2023 \nWL 5963782, at *3-4.  The court concluded that \nbecause Arthrex had not overruled Edmond, it could \nrely on these two factors considered by Edmond in the \nabsence of principal officer review.  Id. at *4.  Manis \nreached a similar conclusion that administrative \noversight and removability were sufficient without \nprincipal officer review because Edmond was still \ngood law.  731 F.Supp.3d at 692-93. \nBut Arthrex did not apply Edmond as a strict \nthree-factor test for Executive Branch adjudications \nsuch that lower courts can simply weigh them up case-\nby-case. Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13, 23.  Both the majority \nand the dissent in Arthrex described the Edmond test \nas the broad principle that \u201c[a]n inferior officer must \nbe \u2018directed and supervised at some level by others \nwho were appointed by Presidential nomination with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\u2019\u201d  Arthrex, 594 \nU.S. at 13; id. at 49 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 217 n.3 (\u201cMore recently, we have \nfocused on whether the officer\u200a\u2019s work is \u2018directed and \nsupervised\u2019 by a principal officer.\u201d).  Arthrex applied \nthis broad test to an Executive Branch adjudication \nand concluded, consistent with Edmond, that inferior \nofficers who make otherwise binding decisions for the \nExecutive Branch must have those decisions reviewed \nby a principal officer. Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 14-15; see \nalso supra Part I.B & C.  The Court should take this \nopportunity to clarify its holding in Arthrex that final, \nbinding decisionmaking in adjudications requires a \nprincipal officer or review of the decision by a \nprincipal officer to avoid further confusion in the lower \ncourts. \n\n \n17 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the above reasons, the Court should affirm the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s judgment as to the officer status of the \nTask Force members. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJOSHUA M.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, which is a formalization of my internal reasoning after analyzing the respondents' \"Brief in Support of Certiorari,\" does not introduce new external evidence. Instead, it solidifies and confirms the conclusions drawn in my previous update. My beliefs are now more firmly anchored, and the central uncertainties are more sharply defined.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Reinforced):**\n    *   The core legal questions remain unchanged: 1) Does the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's structure violate the Appointments Clause? and 2) Is the independence provision severable from the rest of the statute?\n    *   The government's strategy is stable and predictable: It will argue that Task Force members are inferior officers supervised by the HHS Secretary and, failing that, will advocate for the narrow, precedented remedy of severing the independence clause, following the blueprint of *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, and *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB*.\n\n2.  **Evolved & Solidified Beliefs (from Internal Analysis of Respondents' Cert-Stage Brief):**\n    *   **Respondents' Appointments Clause Argument is Confirmed as Maximalist:** My analysis confirms that the respondents will argue that Task Force members are **principal officers** requiring presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. This is not a subtle or marginal argument. It is a direct constitutional challenge based on the idea that the statutory text itself forecloses the government's \"inferior officer\" theory.\n        *   **Legal Basis:** Their argument, as previewed, hinges on the plain text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6), which states the Task Force \"shall be independent.\" They will contend this statutory language makes it legally impossible for the HHS Secretary to exercise the \"direction and supervision\" that *Edmond v. United States* requires for an officer to be deemed \"inferior.\" They will argue that the government's reliance on a background removal power is insufficient to overcome this explicit statutory command for independence.\n    *   **Respondents' Remedial Theory is Confirmed as a Direct Challenge to Precedent:** My analysis confirms the respondents will reject the Court's modern severability doctrine. They are advancing a theory, articulated by their counsel Jonathan Mitchell as the \"writ-of-erasure fallacy,\" that courts lack the constitutional authority to surgically remove a single clause to save a statute.\n        *   **Legal Basis:** They will argue that if the independence clause is unconstitutional, the court cannot \"blue-pencil\" the statute to create a new, constitutional scheme where the Task Force is supervised. Instead, the court's only power is to decline to enforce the provision that gives legal effect to the Task Force's recommendations (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(1)). This is a fundamental challenge to the remedial approach taken in *Arthrex* and other recent separation-of-powers cases.\n\n3.  **Sharpened Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** The primary effect of this internal analysis is to move my uncertainty away from *what the parties will argue* and toward *which well-defined legal philosophy will command a majority*. The battle lines are now exceptionally clear.\n    *   **Uncertainty on Question 1 (Appointments):** The predictive task is to determine if a majority of the Court will prioritize the executive's inherent supervisory powers (as the government argues) or the plain text of a statute mandating independence (as the respondents argue). Will the Court find that the Secretary's implied powers are enough to satisfy *Edmond*, or will it hold that the statute's independence language makes the Task Force members unsupervised principal officers?\n    *   **Uncertainty on Question 2 (Remedy):** The predictive task is to determine if the Court will follow its own recent, pragmatic precedent from *Arthrex* (favoring narrow remedies that preserve statutes) or if a majority will be persuaded by the respondents' more radical, textualist/originalist \"writ-of-erasure\" theory. This sets up a potential ideological split on the Court, possibly pitting pragmatists who favor judicial restraint in remedies (like Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh) against textualist purists who may be drawn to the respondents' theory.\n\nMy confidence in the *nature* of the legal clash is now very high. The next crucial evidence will be the full merits briefs, which will provide the detailed historical and doctrinal scaffolding for these competing frameworks, and the amicus briefs, which will signal how these arguments are being received by broader legal and ideological coalitions.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "The observation of multiple amicus briefs and the government's cert-stage reply has dramatically expanded and refined my understanding of the legal landscape in this case. My prior belief in a two-front legal battle (principal/inferior status and severability) was an oversimplification. The case now presents at least four distinct, potentially dispositive legal questions, offering the Court multiple \"off-ramps\" to decide the case on either broad or narrow grounds.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Reinforced and Detailed):**\n    *   The core legal questions concerning the Appointments Clause and severability remain central.\n    *   The government's primary strategy is confirmed: argue that Task Force members are **inferior officers** properly appointed and supervised by the HHS Secretary. The briefs add specific statutory support for this, citing the Secretary's at-will removal power, general supervisory authority over the Public Health Service (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 202), and the Reorganization Plan of 1966.\n    *   The government's secondary, remedial strategy is also confirmed: if a constitutional violation is found, the Court should follow the precedent of *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*, *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, and *Seila Law LLC v. CFPB* and simply **sever** the independence clause (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)) to cure the defect.\n    *   The respondents' core strategy is likewise confirmed and sharpened: argue that Task Force members are **principal officers** because the \"buck stops with them\" (*Arthrex*), and their statutory independence makes meaningful supervision by the Secretary legally impossible under *Edmond v. United States*. Their challenge to the *Arthrex*-style remedy, based on a \"writ-of-erasure\" theory, is also a confirmed part of their argument.\n    *   The immense **practical and public health stakes** of the case are now a fully-fledged argument theme for the petitioners' side. Multiple amicus briefs (from the Center for HIV Law and Policy, HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute, etc.) detail the potentially catastrophic consequences of invalidating the preventive care mandate, an argument clearly aimed at persuading the Court toward a narrow, less disruptive ruling, particularly on the remedy.\n\n2.  **Evolved & New Beliefs (from Amicus Briefs):**\n    *   **New Potential Off-Ramp for the Government (Are they \"Officers\" at all?):** A significant new argument, advanced by the Public Citizen amicus brief, is that Task Force members are **not \"Officers of the United States\"** in the first place.\n        *   **Legal Basis:** This argument posits that the members are temporary, volunteer expert fact-finders, not holders of a continuous federal \"office\" under the test from *United States v. Germaine*. It further argues they do not wield \"significant authority\" in a manner that implicates the Appointments Clause, but rather function like the expert appraisers in *Auffmordt v. Hedden*, whose findings Congress can legally incorporate into a statutory scheme.\n        *   **Predictive Impact:** This provides the Court with a minimalist, status-quo-preserving path to uphold the entire scheme without reaching any of the more difficult questions about principal/inferior status or severability.\n    *   **New Potential Off-Ramp for the Respondents (The Vesting Clause):** A second, and highly significant, new argument has emerged, highlighted by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) amicus brief and, critically, by a **Supreme Court order for supplemental briefing**. The question is whether Congress ever \"by Law\" vested the appointment power for Task Force members in a constitutionally permissible actor.\n        *   **Legal Basis:** The argument, rooted in cases like *United States v. Hartwell* and *United States v. Smith*, is that the statutory language authorizing the AHRQ Director to \"convene\" the Task Force is not a legal vesting of the \"appointment\" power in the HHS Secretary. If this is correct, the appointments are invalid regardless of whether the members are principal or inferior officers.\n        *   **Predictive Impact:** This is a major development. The fact that the Court itself requested briefing on this issue signals it is a live, and potentially dispositive, question. It offers the Court a way to invalidate the Task Force's authority on narrower statutory grounds than the principal/inferior officer distinction.\n\n3.  **Sharpened Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** My predictive task has evolved from a binary choice to a complex analysis of which of four primary legal pathways will command a majority. The central uncertainty is no longer just about the outcome, but the Court's entire method of resolution.\n    *   **Path 1 (Minimalist Upholding):** The Court could adopt the Public Citizen theory that Task Force members are **not officers**, upholding the ACA provision entirely.\n    *   **Path 2 (Standard Upholding):** The Court could find they **are inferior officers** and that their appointment and supervision (via at-will removal) are constitutional, also upholding the provision.\n    *   **Path 3 (Narrow Invalidation):** The Court could sidestep the principal/inferior debate and agree with the NCLA argument that the **Vesting Clause was not satisfied**, invalidating the appointments on that basis.\n    *   **Path 4 (Broad Invalidation):** The Court could agree with the respondents that the members are unconstitutionally appointed **principal officers**.\n\n    If the Court chooses Path 3 or 4, the secondary uncertainty remains the remedy: will the Court follow *Arthrex* and **sever** the problematic statutory provision (the pragmatic path), or will it adopt the respondents' theory and simply **refuse to enforce** the mandate (the purist path)?\n\nMy confidence is now very high in my understanding of the full array of legal arguments at play. The amicus briefs have illuminated the strategic depth on both sides, revealing that the final decision could turn on foundational questions of who qualifies as an officer, the precise statutory meaning of \"convene\" versus \"appoint,\" the power of at-will removal, or the finality of decision-making authority. The Court's own interest in the Vesting Clause is a crucial new signal about where its focus may lie.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, an internal synthesis of previously gathered amicus briefs and court filings, provides no new external evidence. However, it marks a crucial evolution in my predictive process, moving from information acquisition to structured analysis. My understanding of the case's legal landscape has now been consolidated into a clear predictive framework, which will be the basis for my final prediction. My prior beliefs about the specific legal arguments and their sources remain stable and have been organized into this new structure.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Reinforced and Structured):**\n    *   My comprehensive understanding of the legal arguments from the government, respondents, and various amici is confirmed. The information gathered previously appears to cover the full spectrum of likely arguments.\n    *   The core precedents remain central to the analysis: *Edmond v. United States* (supervision of inferior officers), *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* (the \"buck stops here\" test and severability remedy), *United States v. Germaine* (definition of an \"office\"), and *United States v. Hartwell* (vesting of appointment power).\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (From Synthesis to Predictive Framework):**\n    *   My belief state has matured from an inventory of arguments into a structured decision-tree model. The central task is no longer to identify arguments, but to predict which path a majority of the Court will follow. This framework consists of two stages: the merits of the Appointments Clause claim and the potential remedy.\n\n    *   **Stage 1: The Merits (The Four Paths).** I have now formally structured the primary legal question into four distinct, potential pathways for the Court's ruling:\n        *   **Path 1 (Minimalist Upholding - \"Not Officers\"):** The Court could adopt the Public Citizen amicus argument that Task Force members are temporary expert advisors, not \"Officers of the United States\" under the *Germaine* test, thus avoiding the Appointments Clause issue entirely. This is the narrowest path to affirm the Fifth Circuit's decision in part and uphold the ACA provision.\n        *   **Path 2 (Standard Upholding - \"Inferior Officers\"):** The Court could accept the government's primary argument that the members are inferior officers, constitutionally appointed because the HHS Secretary's at-will removal power constitutes sufficient supervision under *Edmond*.\n        *   **Path 3 (Narrow Invalidation - \"Vesting Clause Violation\"):** The Court could follow the NCLA/Texas amicus argument\u2014which the Court itself requested supplemental briefing on\u2014that the statute's instruction for the AHRQ Director to \"convene\" the Task Force does not constitute a legal \"vesting\" of the appointment power in the HHS Secretary as required by the Constitution. This is a powerful signal of the Court's interest and provides a narrow, textualist ground for invalidating the Task Force's authority.\n        *   **Path 4 (Broad Invalidation - \"Principal Officers\"):** The Court could agree with the respondents that the Task Force's statutory independence and final decision-making authority make them unaccountable principal officers who must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n    *   **Stage 2: The Remedy (Contingent on Invalidation).** If the Court chooses Path 3 or 4, the secondary predictive challenge is the remedy:\n        *   **Option A (Severability):** The Court follows the modern remedial precedent of *Arthrex*, *Free Enterprise Fund*, and *Seila Law* and simply severs the problematic statutory provision (the independence clause, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 299b-4(a)(6)), making the Task Force members clearly subordinate to the HHS Secretary and curing the constitutional defect going forward. This is the government's preferred, pragmatic outcome.\n        *   **Option B (Non-Enforcement):** The Court adopts the respondents' more purist view and simply declares the Task Force's past and current recommendations unenforceable, refusing to perform the \"legislative\" act of rewriting the statute.\n\n3.  **Sharpened Definition of Key Uncertainty (\u03b8):** My central uncertainty is no longer about the *content* of the legal arguments, but about the *likelihood* of the Court choosing one path over the others. The synthesis has clarified that the predictive task is to assess the judicial philosophies of the individual Justices and determine which of these well-defined options is most likely to command a majority. The Court's own interest in the Vesting Clause (Path 3) remains a critical signal, suggesting it may be a highly plausible route for a majority coalition seeking to invalidate the Task Force's authority on narrower grounds than the principal/inferior officer debate.",

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

Linkedin Facebook X Youtube Share What's NewNewsEventsPublicationsSubscribeMedia ContactBlogsFederal Policy Watch: Monitoring White House Developments Supreme Court Decides When Administrative Law Judges Must Have Constitutional AppointmentsNewsletter Share Share 7.26.2018Recently, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018), the Supreme Court decided when administrative law judges must be appointed under the terms of the Constitution. This ruling may affect the authority of similar judges in a wide variety of federal agencies. In Lucia, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an investment company with violating securities laws and assigned an administrative law judge (ALJ) to decide the case. The ALJ found against the company and it appealed to the full SEC arguing that the ruling was invalid because ALJ had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the United States Constitution. The Appointments Clause requires \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to be appointed only by the President, \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cHeads of Departments.\u201d But the ALJ in Lucia had been selected by SEC staff members, rather than the SEC itself. The SEC and an evenly-divided Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the company\u2019s argument, reasoning that ALJs are \u201cmere employees\u201d\u2014not \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that SEC ALJs are in fact \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court explained the basic framework for distinguishing between officers and employees: employees are \u201coccasional or temporary,\u201d whereas officers are \u201ccontinuing and permanent,\u201d and officers \u201cexercise\u201d significant authority under the laws of the United States.\u201d This inquiry turns on whether an individual (1) holds a career appointment created by statute and (2) exercises significant judicial discretion similar to that of a federal trial judge. The Court held that the SEC\u2019s ALJs both hold a continuing office and exercise significant authority, including taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and enforcing compliance with discovery rules. In reaching this conclusion, the Court also relied on an earlier decision in which it held that similar administrative judges working for the Internal Revenue Service were also covered by the Appointments Clause. Because the ALJ did not have proper authority to decide the case, the Court reversed the decision against the investment company and returned the case to the SEC with directions that the case be decided by another ALJ who had been properly appointed or by the full SEC itself. The Open Question: How Does Lucia Affect Other Federal Agencies? The Lucia decision may reach well beyond just the SEC\u2019s ALJs. The same fundamental principles that guided the Court in Lucia\u2014whether ALJs\u2019 positions are \u201ccontinuing and permanent\u201d as created by statute and whether they exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d akin to a federal trial judge\u2014may be applied equally to a variety of other federal agencies. In the wake of Lucia, the authority of other federal ALJs will likely be reexamined to determine if they too are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under the Appointments Clause. E.

Noel Canning, in which the Court will consider the constitutionality of the president\u2019s recess appointments to the NLRB.\u00a0 Lyle summarized the issues in the case last week in a \u201cMade simple\u201d post. The following contribution comes from Michael Rappaport, the Hugh and Hazel Darling Foundation Professor of Law at the University of San Diego. The issues raised by National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, which provides the Supreme Court with its first opportunity to interpret the Recess Appointments Clause, are easy to misinterpret.\u00a0 Many people view the case as political or partisan. \u00a0After all, the recess appointments involved NLRB officials who decide issues that generate much political controversy.\u00a0 The D.C. Circuit decision was written from an originalist perspective by a conservative judge and joined by two Republican appointees.\u00a0 A Third Circuit decision, which also found the NLRB recess appointments unconstitutional on originalist grounds, was again supported by Republican appointees, with a dissent by a Democratic appointee. But it is a serious and shortsighted mistake to view the issues at stake in partisan terms.\u00a0 The easiest way to see this is to go back eight years, when President George Bush was recess-appointing judges who were being filibustered by the Democratic Senate minority.\u00a0 At that time, a broad recess appointment power was attacked by liberals, including a court challenge joined by liberal icon Senator Ted Kennedy.\u00a0 The resulting Eleventh Circuit decision allowing a broad recess appointment in Evans v. Stephens was written by a Republican appointee, with a strong dissent advocating a narrow interpretation of the Clause on originalist grounds written by liberal judge Rosemary Barkett. While the recess appointments power can obviously be partisan in the short run, in the long run it concerns nonpartisan matters about the allocation of constitutional authority and checks and balances.\u00a0 I have always viewed the Clause in these terms.\u00a0 When I wrote my 2005 article on the Original Meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause, my position led me to contest the Bush recess appointments and to agree with Ted Kennedy \u2013 not a familiar position for me.\u00a0 If we step back from today\u2019s short-run politics, there are strong arguments based on the original meaning, on modern circumstances, and on maintaining limits on presidential power for following a narrow interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. The Recess Appointments Clause provides that \u201c[t]he President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d\u00a0 There were two basic questions decided by the D.C. Circuit \u00a0in the case below: the \u201chappen\u201d issue and the \u201ctype of recess\u201d issue.\u00a0 The \u201chappen\u201d issue involves when the vacancy must happen for it to be eligible for a recess appointment.\u00a0 Under the \u201carise interpretation,\u201d the vacancy must arise during the recess for which the recess appointment is being made.\u00a0 This interpretation derives from the Clause\u2019s text, which speaks of filling up \u201cvacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\u201d\u00a0 By contrast, the \u201cexist view\u201d claims that it does not matter when a vacancy arises so long as it exists during the recess.\u00a0 As even advocates of the \u201cexist view\u201d have admitted, the Clause\u2019s language supports the \u201carise interpretation,\u201d because that is the more obvious and natural reading and because the words \u201cthat may happen\u201d are redundant under the \u201cexist view.\u201d Proponents of the \u201cexist view\u201d have argued that this textual weakness is overcome by the Clause\u2019s underlying purpose to ensure that vacancies are filled during recesses.\u00a0 But the executive has a one-sided view of that purpose, ignoring the Clause\u2019s purpose to allow vacancies to be filled with a power that does not permit the executive to freely circumvent the requirement of senatorial consent.\u00a0 Under the \u201cexist view,\u201d the President can fill any vacancy, whenever the vacancy arises, simply by waiting until a recess occurs.\u00a0 The \u201carise view,\u201d by contrast, would have allowed the President historically to fill virtually all significant vacancies that could not have been addressed by the Senate, without eviscerating the requirement of senatorial consent in other cases. The second issue concerns the type of recess or legislative break for which a recess appointment can be made. \u00a0There are at least two different types of legislative breaks:\u00a0 intersession recesses, which occur between the two annual sessions of the Congress, and intra-session recesses, which occur during the session of Congress.\u00a0 The \u201cintersession view\u201d limits recess appointments to intersession recesses, whereas the \u201cintra-session view\u201d allows them during either intersession recesses or intra-session recesses of a certain length. It makes sense that the original meaning would have protected only intersession recess appointments.\u00a0 When the Constitution was enacted, intersession recesses lasted for six to nine months, and therefore it would have been necessary for the President to be able to fill offices that became vacant during this period.\u00a0 By contrast, intra-session recesses were extremely short (such as three days) and therefore would not have required recess appointments. The intersession view also makes sense textually.\u00a0 Despite the modern usage of \u201cintra-session recess,\u201d the constitutional term \u201crecess\u201d refers only to intersession recesses.\u00a0 When the Constitution refers to legislative breaks generally \u2013 either during the session or between sessions \u2013 it calls them \u201cadjournments.\u201d\u00a0 The Constitution uses the terms \u201crecess\u201d or \u201cadjournments\u201d (including their close relatives, such as \u201cadjourn\u201d) in seven different clauses, and the meanings I offer make sense of all seven clauses. The intra-session view also suffers from two other serious infirmities.\u00a0 First, the Constitution contains no principled limitation \u2013 either explicit or implicit \u2013 for determining how long an intra-session recess needs to be to justify a recess appointment.\u00a0 That means there will either be no limitation \u2013 which would lead to absurd results \u2013 or an arbitrary one.\u00a0 Second, an intra-session recess appointment lasts longer \u2013 perhaps twice as long \u2013 as an intersession recess appointment, even though there is no policy reason for that and the shorter length of intra-session recesses suggests that such appointments should have shorter durations. The original meaning, however, is not the only reason to favor the narrow interpretation.\u00a0 Many people reject originalism in favor of living constitutionalism.\u00a0 But a focus on modern circumstances and values does not support a broad recess appointment power either.\u00a0 Providing the President with a recess appointment power was strongly supported by the long annual recess that existed when the Constitution was enacted.\u00a0 This arrangement was the result of slow transportation to and from the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 But in a world of airplanes, the Senate now regularly holds between seven and twelve recesses per year, with most recesses lasting less than two weeks, and with recesses only in the rarest of cases extending to two months.\u00a0 If the Constitution were written today, it is not at all clear that there would be a recess appointment power, and if one existed, it certainly would not extend to all of these recesses. Defenders of a broad recess appointment power argue that a ten-day or twenty-day recess might leave positions vacant and therefore require recess appointments, but this is a vast overstatement.\u00a0 First, short recesses of this type do not significantly contribute to the overall length of a vacancy.\u00a0 In contrast to the rhetoric used to defend recess appointments for such recesses, appointments take a long time in the modern world.\u00a0 Statistics indicate that the median length of time that it takes to appoint an official requiring senatorial consent is five months and that the average length of time from inauguration until confirmation for initial appointees is eight months.\u00a0 A significant portion of this time is spent engaged in activities that improve the quality of the appointment, such as interviewing potential nominees and conducting background checks.\u00a0 If substantial time is spent for these activities, then incurring additional time for senatorial confirmation \u2013 which is a key way that the Constitution ensures high quality appointments \u2013 is also appropriate. Second, vacancies are not nearly as costly for law execution (or adjudication) as defenders of a broad recess appointment power suggest.\u00a0 There are alternative ways of filling these positions, such as acting appointments.\u00a0 Moreover, multi-member commissions do not require all of their members to be filled, because a subset of the commission can constitute a quorum for business.\u00a0 Overall, modern appointment practices suggest that the additional time of ten or even thirty days does not justify bypassing senatorial confirmation, especially when recess appointments can last so long. In the end, there is a strong argument for the Supreme Court to follow the original meaning here and adopt both the \u201carise\u201d and the intersession views of the Clause.\u00a0 Following the original meaning is supported not merely by originalist arguments, but also by considerations relevant to living constitutionalism. Of course, there is much more to say about the issue. \u00a0One might also favor a narrow interpretation as a means of placing limits on a continually growing presidential power.\u00a0 There are also other arguments made for the broad interpretation, such as the claim that long practice supports it.\u00a0 While there is not space to address this \u201cpractice\u201d argument, the short answer is that the practice is entitled to little respect because it has been changing and has resulted from consistent and aggressive assertions of presidential power. \u00a0These assertions are based on problematic interpretations of both the Constitution and statutes, and are made with as little regard for the opposing views of the political branches as the president\u2019s recent claim that the Senate was in recess, despite that house\u2019s assertion to the contrary.\u00a0 In my view, these additional arguments do not affect the basic point that the Constitution\u2019s original meaning established a narrow exception to the requirement of Senate confirmation and that the broad view allows circumvention of that power with little benefit for the republic.

She filed an amicus brief\u00a0in support of Raymond Lucia in\u00a0Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled in Lucia v. SEC, evaluating whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had used improper methods to hire its administrative law judges. A fairly lopsided 7-2 margin of justices concluded that it had. Standing alone, Justice Stephen Breyer found that the SEC had committed a statutory violation by improperly delegating appointments authority to staff \u2014 similar to an argument previously raised by professor Jennifer Nou. Six of the remaining justices held that the SEC\u2019s staff-level appointments of ALJs constituted a constitutional violation. In an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court concluded that the SEC\u2019s ALJs are \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d who must be appointed by \u201cthe President, a court of law, or a head of department\u201d \u2014 not by staff. In addition to the somewhat surprising margin of decision in what at times seemed a controversial case, the Lucia litigation had several atypical twists along the way. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had agreed to rehear the Lucia decision en banc even though the panel opinion was a straight-up application of D.C. Circuit precedent from 2000. Then the en banc court split 5-5, issuing just \u201ca per curiam order denying Lucia\u2019s claim.\u201d Finally, at the cert stage, the government changed its litigating position, agreeing with the petitioner that the ALJs are \u201cofficers.\u201d Further, the solicitor general asked the court to consider whether the ALJ\u2019s good-cause removal protections improperly restrict executive supervision. The SG\u2019s position appeared well-calculated yesterday. The seven-justice determination that the ALJ appointments were unlawful suggested that the SG\u2019s legal position was on solid ground. And although generally one thinks of the SG\u2019s role as to defend executive branch practices \u2014 such as an agency\u2019s staffing procedures \u2014 larger-scale issues of the integrity of executive power were at play. Ultimately the government\u2019s position defended the Article II prerogative of the executive to have either himself or his one-step-removed department head appoint executive officers. Further, Breyer\u2019s opinion agreed with the government that the constitutional removal and appointments questions were inextricably intertwined. Despite the intriguing posture of the case, in the end the majority opinion itself was modest. As prolific appointments clause scholar Kent Barnett has pointed out, the Lucia decision was about as narrow as it could be. Kagan\u2019s remarks at oral argument foreshadowed the outcome. In 1991, in Freytag v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court held that special trial judges who presided over certain Tax Court proceedings were Article II \u201cofficers.\u201d In an exchange with court-appointed amicus Anton Metlitsky at oral argument, Kagan said: \u201c[I]f you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you\u2019d pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion consequently pointed out that the Freytag STJs \u201care near-carbon copies\u201d of the SEC\u2019s ALJs. Both sets of officers \u201ctake testimony,\u201d \u201c[r]eceiv[e] evidence and [e]xamine witnesses at hearings,\u201d \u201ctake pre-hearing depositions,\u201d \u201cconduct trials,\u201d \u201cadminister oaths, rule on motions,\u201d \u201cgenerally regulat[e] the course of a hearing,\u201d \u201crule on the admissibility of evidence,\u201d and \u201chave the power to . . . punish all [c]ontemptuous conduct\u201d \u2014 i.e., both may utilize \u201cnearly all the tools of federal trial judges.\u201d At the most basic level, then, Lucia is just a straightforward application of Freytag. But the Lucia opinion also brings some subtle changes to the court\u2019s formulation of the Article II \u201cofficer\u201d standard that may impact appointments clause cases in the lower courts. For starters, in the past, the D.C. Circuit in particular has read essentially every facet of Supreme Court appointments-clause discussion as establishing new mandatory \u201cofficer\u201d elements. In Freytag, the court discussed final decision-making authority in the alternative \u2014 and the D.C. Circuit concluded that only officials with such authority are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Freytag court mentioned discretionary authority and the handling of important issues as indicia of Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status\u2014 and the D.C. Circuit in Tucker v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue suggested that both of those factors \u2014 and final decision-making \u2014 are mandatory. In Lucia, the court indicated that this interpretive approach is incorrect. The court explicitly stated that it was not deciding whether each ALJ/STJ characteristic is constitutionally required \u201cfor someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer.\u201d In other words, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch expressed in their concurring opinion, the court\u2019s opinions have suggested that certain characteristics are sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, for Article II \u201cofficer\u201d status. Moving forward, if lower courts can identify that a particular official has responsibilities that are more significant than those of the SEC\u2019s ALJs, a court might fairly confidently rule that the official is an \u201cofficer.\u201d But for any position with duties non-analogous to agency adjudicators, or with duties arguably less weighty than the SEC\u2019s ALJs, there is an open question. Lower courts, and Congress when it creates new governmental positions, will have to use their best judgment to compare and contrast the position under consideration with officials previously determined to be \u201cofficers.\u201d But lower courts can no longer point to highly detailed factors from a particular Supreme Court appointments clause decision and necessarily contend that those factors have been mandated by the court. In continuity with Buckley v.Valeo, the court in Lucia remains committed to the amorphous \u201csignificant authority\u201d standard for \u201cofficer\u201d status, declining to flesh it out any more than just to clarify that the SEC\u2019s ALJs satisfy it under Freytag. The one curious addition that the Lucia opinion does emphasize, however, is the threshold qualification that only officials in \u201ccontinuing positions\u201d are \u201cofficers.\u201d The Lucia opinion suggests that this \u201ccontinuing position\u201d element \u2014 emphasized in United States v. Germaine in 1879 \u2014 was also embraced by the court in Freytag. But neither of the court\u2019s modern appointments clause decisions, in Buckley or Freytag, explicitly imposed the \u201ccontinuing\u201d officer requirement. And no litigant in Lucia contended that this element might be outcome-determinative. Perhaps the court highlighted the \u201ccontinuing position\u201d qualification for \u201cofficer\u201d status along with its discussion of \u201csignificant authority\u201d because the qualification plays a fairly prominent role in the Department of Justice\u2019s 2007 \u201cofficer\u201d definition, discussed in the SG\u2019s Lucia brief. Or, perhaps the court is trying to more closely tie the modern Buckley officer formulation to its 19th-century appointments clause cases. At one point the court in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2010 suggested that language in Germaine indicates that the vast majority of civil servants are non-officers. But the 2010 opinion apparently misconstrued Germaine\u2018s discussion to apply to fulltime government employees, not just to individuals hired intermittently for services like government contractors or the civil surgeons at issue in Germaine. One final point about the Lucia opinions that merits discussion relates to Breyer\u2019s continued uneasiness about the impact of appointments clause jurisprudence on civil service tenure protections. Breyer indicates that he turned to statutory grounds in Lucia because he is deeply concerned that concluding that ALJs are Article II \u201cofficers\u201d may lead to the companion conclusion that ALJ tenure protections are barred under Free Enterprise Fund\u2018s prohibition on double for-cause removal protections for certain executive officers. Further, Breyer fears that applying Free Enterprise Fund to \u201chigh-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.\u201d But this final concern appears to be based, at least in part, on factual imprecision. Arthur served during the 1883 enactment of the Pendleton Act, the first statute to establish a comprehensive merit-based civil service selection system. But that act had very little to do with the labyrinthine set of tenure protections applicable to civil servants today. The theory of an expert civil service at the time was based much more on selecting qualified officers on the front end. The Pendleton Act barred only removals motivated by retaliation related to political campaign activity. Even the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2018s establishment of more generous removal protections in 1912 apparently was motivated by particular concerns related to whistleblowing-employee speech protections \u2014 not a generalized idea that federal employees must be insulated from removal to ensure an expert civil service. The court\u2019s apparently modest-at-least-for-now opinion in Lucia intentionally leaves several unanswered questions. Are the ALJs\u2019 tenure protections unconstitutionally restrictive? (The court needs thorough lower-court review before it would take this up.) Has the SEC properly ratified the previously improper ALJ appointments? (The court sees no reason to address this.) Is a \u201cnew officer \u2026 required for every Appointments Clause violation\u201d? (Not necessarily.) What exactly are the factors that give a government official sufficiently \u201csignificant authority\u201d to be an \u201cofficer\u201d? (You have it if the court has held previously that your position is an \u201coffice.\u201d) It\u2019s unclear how, or whether, courts will address these issues in the future. But it seems likely that appointments clause scholars and practitioners will be productively employed for at least a few more years.

Linkedin Facebook X Youtube Share What's NewNewsEventsPublicationsSubscribeMedia ContactBlogsFederal Policy Watch: Monitoring White House Developments Supreme Court Decides When Administrative Law Judges Must Have Constitutional AppointmentsNewsletter Share Share 7.26.2018Recently, in Lucia v. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018), the Supreme Court decided when administrative law judges must be appointed under the terms of the Constitution. This ruling may affect the authority of similar judges in a wide variety of federal agencies. In Lucia, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged an investment company with violating securities laws and assigned an administrative law judge (ALJ) to decide the case. The ALJ found against the company and it appealed to the full SEC arguing that the ruling was invalid because ALJ had not been properly appointed under the Appointments Clause of Article II of the United States Constitution. The Appointments Clause requires \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d to be appointed only by the President, \u201cCourts of Law,\u201d or \u201cHeads of Departments.\u201d But the ALJ in Lucia had been selected by SEC staff members, rather than the SEC itself. The SEC and an evenly-divided Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the company\u2019s argument, reasoning that ALJs are \u201cmere employees\u201d\u2014not \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that SEC ALJs are in fact \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court explained the basic framework for distinguishing between officers and employees: employees are \u201coccasional or temporary,\u201d whereas officers are \u201ccontinuing and permanent,\u201d and officers \u201cexercise\u201d significant authority under the laws of the United States.\u201d This inquiry turns on whether an individual (1) holds a career appointment created by statute and (2) exercises significant judicial discretion similar to that of a federal trial judge. The Court held that the SEC\u2019s ALJs both hold a continuing office and exercise significant authority, including taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and enforcing compliance with discovery rules. In reaching this conclusion, the Court also relied on an earlier decision in which it held that similar administrative judges working for the Internal Revenue Service were also covered by the Appointments Clause. Because the ALJ did not have proper authority to decide the case, the Court reversed the decision against the investment company and returned the case to the SEC with directions that the case be decided by another ALJ who had been properly appointed or by the full SEC itself. The Open Question: How Does Lucia Affect Other Federal Agencies? The Lucia decision may reach well beyond just the SEC\u2019s ALJs. The same fundamental principles that guided the Court in Lucia\u2014whether ALJs\u2019 positions are \u201ccontinuing and permanent\u201d as created by statute and whether they exercise \u201csignificant authority\u201d akin to a federal trial judge\u2014may be applied equally to a variety of other federal agencies. In the wake of Lucia, the authority of other federal ALJs will likely be reexamined to determine if they too are \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d under the Appointments Clause. E.

Noel Canning, in which the Court will consider the constitutionality of the president\u2019s recess appointments to the NLRB.\u00a0 Lyle summarized the issues in the case last week in a \u201cMade simple\u201d post. The following contribution comes from Michael Rappaport, the Hugh and Hazel Darling Foundation Professor of Law at the University of San Diego. The issues raised by National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, which provides the Supreme Court with its first opportunity to interpret the Recess Appointments Clause, are easy to misinterpret.\u00a0 Many people view the case as political or partisan. \u00a0After all, the recess appointments involved NLRB officials who decide issues that generate much political controversy.\u00a0 The D.C. Circuit decision was written from an originalist perspective by a conservative judge and joined by two Republican appointees.\u00a0 A Third Circuit decision, which also found the NLRB recess appointments unconstitutional on originalist grounds, was again supported by Republican appointees, with a dissent by a Democratic appointee. But it is a serious and shortsighted mistake to view the issues at stake in partisan terms.\u00a0 The easiest way to see this is to go back eight years, when President George Bush was recess-appointing judges who were being filibustered by the Democratic Senate minority.\u00a0 At that time, a broad recess appointment power was attacked by liberals, including a court challenge joined by liberal icon Senator Ted Kennedy.\u00a0 The resulting Eleventh Circuit decision allowing a broad recess appointment in Evans v. Stephens was written by a Republican appointee, with a strong dissent advocating a narrow interpretation of the Clause on originalist grounds written by liberal judge Rosemary Barkett. While the recess appointments power can obviously be partisan in the short run, in the long run it concerns nonpartisan matters about the allocation of constitutional authority and checks and balances.\u00a0 I have always viewed the Clause in these terms.\u00a0 When I wrote my 2005 article on the Original Meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause, my position led me to contest the Bush recess appointments and to agree with Ted Kennedy \u2013 not a familiar position for me.\u00a0 If we step back from today\u2019s short-run politics, there are strong arguments based on the original meaning, on modern circumstances, and on maintaining limits on presidential power for following a narrow interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause. The Recess Appointments Clause provides that \u201c[t]he President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d\u00a0 There were two basic questions decided by the D.C. Circuit \u00a0in the case below: the \u201chappen\u201d issue and the \u201ctype of recess\u201d issue.\u00a0 The \u201chappen\u201d issue involves when the vacancy must happen for it to be eligible for a recess appointment.\u00a0 Under the \u201carise interpretation,\u201d the vacancy must arise during the recess for which the recess appointment is being made.\u00a0 This interpretation derives from the Clause\u2019s text, which speaks of filling up \u201cvacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.\u201d\u00a0 By contrast, the \u201cexist view\u201d claims that it does not matter when a vacancy arises so long as it exists during the recess.\u00a0 As even advocates of the \u201cexist view\u201d have admitted, the Clause\u2019s language supports the \u201carise interpretation,\u201d because that is the more obvious and natural reading and because the words \u201cthat may happen\u201d are redundant under the \u201cexist view.\u201d Proponents of the \u201cexist view\u201d have argued that this textual weakness is overcome by the Clause\u2019s underlying purpose to ensure that vacancies are filled during recesses.\u00a0 But the executive has a one-sided view of that purpose, ignoring the Clause\u2019s purpose to allow vacancies to be filled with a power that does not permit the executive to freely circumvent the requirement of senatorial consent.\u00a0 Under the \u201cexist view,\u201d the President can fill any vacancy, whenever the vacancy arises, simply by waiting until a recess occurs.\u00a0 The \u201carise view,\u201d by contrast, would have allowed the President historically to fill virtually all significant vacancies that could not have been addressed by the Senate, without eviscerating the requirement of senatorial consent in other cases. The second issue concerns the type of recess or legislative break for which a recess appointment can be made. \u00a0There are at least two different types of legislative breaks:\u00a0 intersession recesses, which occur between the two annual sessions of the Congress, and intra-session recesses, which occur during the session of Congress.\u00a0 The \u201cintersession view\u201d limits recess appointments to intersession recesses, whereas the \u201cintra-session view\u201d allows them during either intersession recesses or intra-session recesses of a certain length. It makes sense that the original meaning would have protected only intersession recess appointments.\u00a0 When the Constitution was enacted, intersession recesses lasted for six to nine months, and therefore it would have been necessary for the President to be able to fill offices that became vacant during this period.\u00a0 By contrast, intra-session recesses were extremely short (such as three days) and therefore would not have required recess appointments. The intersession view also makes sense textually.\u00a0 Despite the modern usage of \u201cintra-session recess,\u201d the constitutional term \u201crecess\u201d refers only to intersession recesses.\u00a0 When the Constitution refers to legislative breaks generally \u2013 either during the session or between sessions \u2013 it calls them \u201cadjournments.\u201d\u00a0 The Constitution uses the terms \u201crecess\u201d or \u201cadjournments\u201d (including their close relatives, such as \u201cadjourn\u201d) in seven different clauses, and the meanings I offer make sense of all seven clauses. The intra-session view also suffers from two other serious infirmities.\u00a0 First, the Constitution contains no principled limitation \u2013 either explicit or implicit \u2013 for determining how long an intra-session recess needs to be to justify a recess appointment.\u00a0 That means there will either be no limitation \u2013 which would lead to absurd results \u2013 or an arbitrary one.\u00a0 Second, an intra-session recess appointment lasts longer \u2013 perhaps twice as long \u2013 as an intersession recess appointment, even though there is no policy reason for that and the shorter length of intra-session recesses suggests that such appointments should have shorter durations. The original meaning, however, is not the only reason to favor the narrow interpretation.\u00a0 Many people reject originalism in favor of living constitutionalism.\u00a0 But a focus on modern circumstances and values does not support a broad recess appointment power either.\u00a0 Providing the President with a recess appointment power was strongly supported by the long annual recess that existed when the Constitution was enacted.\u00a0 This arrangement was the result of slow transportation to and from the nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 But in a world of airplanes, the Senate now regularly holds between seven and twelve recesses per year, with most recesses lasting less than two weeks, and with recesses only in the rarest of cases extending to two months.\u00a0 If the Constitution were written today, it is not at all clear that there would be a recess appointment power, and if one existed, it certainly would not extend to all of these recesses. Defenders of a broad recess appointment power argue that a ten-day or twenty-day recess might leave positions vacant and therefore require recess appointments, but this is a vast overstatement.\u00a0 First, short recesses of this type do not significantly contribute to the overall length of a vacancy.\u00a0 In contrast to the rhetoric used to defend recess appointments for such recesses, appointments take a long time in the modern world.\u00a0 Statistics indicate that the median length of time that it takes to appoint an official requiring senatorial consent is five months and that the average length of time from inauguration until confirmation for initial appointees is eight months.\u00a0 A significant portion of this time is spent engaged in activities that improve the quality of the appointment, such as interviewing potential nominees and conducting background checks.\u00a0 If substantial time is spent for these activities, then incurring additional time for senatorial confirmation \u2013 which is a key way that the Constitution ensures high quality appointments \u2013 is also appropriate. Second, vacancies are not nearly as costly for law execution (or adjudication) as defenders of a broad recess appointment power suggest.\u00a0 There are alternative ways of filling these positions, such as acting appointments.\u00a0 Moreover, multi-member commissions do not require all of their members to be filled, because a subset of the commission can constitute a quorum for business.\u00a0 Overall, modern appointment practices suggest that the additional time of ten or even thirty days does not justify bypassing senatorial confirmation, especially when recess appointments can last so long. In the end, there is a strong argument for the Supreme Court to follow the original meaning here and adopt both the \u201carise\u201d and the intersession views of the Clause.\u00a0 Following the original meaning is supported not merely by originalist arguments, but also by considerations relevant to living constitutionalism. Of course, there is much more to say about the issue. \u00a0One might also favor a narrow interpretation as a means of placing limits on a continually growing presidential power.\u00a0 There are also other arguments made for the broad interpretation, such as the claim that long practice supports it.\u00a0 While there is not space to address this \u201cpractice\u201d argument, the short answer is that the practice is entitled to little respect because it has been changing and has resulted from consistent and aggressive assertions of presidential power. \u00a0These assertions are based on problematic interpretations of both the Constitution and statutes, and are made with as little regard for the opposing views of the political branches as the president\u2019s recent claim that the Senate was in recess, despite that house\u2019s assertion to the contrary.\u00a0 In my view, these additional arguments do not affect the basic point that the Constitution\u2019s original meaning established a narrow exception to the requirement of Senate confirmation and that the broad view allows circumvention of that power with little benefit for the republic.

Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) regarding the legal landscape of *Kennedy v. Braidwood* remain stable, but my understanding of the next step required for prediction is now explicitly confirmed.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Confirmed and Unchanged):**\n    *   My comprehensive predictive framework, which was the output of my previous synthesis, remains the definitive structure for my analysis. No new information has altered this model.\n    *   The core legal precedents that will govern the outcome are unchanged: *Edmond v. United States* (supervision), *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* (remedy and severability), *United States v. Germaine* and *United States v. Hartwell* (definition of \"officer\" and appointment power).\n    *   The four potential pathways for the Court's decision on the merits remain the most likely outcomes: (1) Task Force members are not \"Officers\"; (2) they are properly appointed \"Inferior Officers\"; (3) their appointment violates the Vesting Clause; or (4) they are unconstitutional \"Principal Officers.\"\n    *   The two primary remedial options, contingent on a finding of a constitutional violation, also remain stable: (A) severing the problematic statutory language (*Arthrex* remedy) or (B) declaring the Task Force's recommendations unenforceable.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (Strategic Confirmation):**\n    *   While no new case-specific facts were learned, the observation confirms the evolution of my predictive task. The challenge is no longer one of legal discovery (identifying arguments) but of judicial psycho-analytics (predicting how individual Justices will align with those arguments).\n    *   My central uncertainty (\u03b8) is solidified: the task is to assign probabilities to each of the four merits paths and two remedial options by analyzing the judicial philosophies and voting records of the nine Justices. The observation confirms that my next action must be to gather this justice-specific information, as it is now the most critical variable for reducing my predictive uncertainty. The internal reasoning has validated that simply analyzing the case filings is no longer sufficient.\n\nIn essence, my knowledge base regarding the legal questions and arguments in *Kennedy v. Braidwood* is stable and well-structured. The latest observation serves as a checkpoint, confirming that my belief state is complete with respect to the case's internal facts and that the path to a final prediction now requires external analysis of the decision-makers themselves.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape in *Kennedy v. Braidwood* has been significantly refined by analyzing recent Supreme Court Appointments Clause jurisprudence. While my foundational predictive framework remains intact, the new information provides critical texture and clarifies the specific analytical tests the Court is likely to apply.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Confirmed and Reinforced):**\n    *   The core legal precedents I previously identified remain central. *United States v. Germaine* is confirmed as the origin of the \"continuing position\" test for officer status. *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* remains the key precedent for the remedial question of severability.\n    *   My predictive model, based on four potential outcomes for the merits and two for the remedy, continues to be a valid structure for analysis. The new information helps populate this model with more specific legal tests.\n    *   The need to analyze individual Justice's philosophies is reinforced. The observation of analysis on *NLRB v. Noel Canning* highlights the deep methodological divides on the Court regarding separation of powers, particularly the tension between originalist/formalist interpretations (likely to be favored by Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) and more functionalist or precedent-bound approaches.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (Refined and Expanded):**\n    *   **The \"Officer\" Test is Now Sharper:** My understanding of how the Court determines \"officer\" status has moved from a general reliance on precedent to a specific, two-prong test crystallized in *Lucia v. SEC*. The Court will ask:\n        1.  **Does the individual hold a \"continuing position\" established by law?** The Task Force members' four-year terms almost certainly satisfy this prong, making it a point of low contention.\n        2.  **Does the individual exercise \"significant authority\" under the laws of the United States?** This is the central battleground. The observation clarifies that the Court's analysis of this prong is highly analogical.\n    *   ***Lucia v. SEC* as the Primary Analogical Framework:** The 2018 *Lucia* decision is now the most direct and relevant precedent for the \"officer\" question. The Court in *Lucia* found SEC ALJs were officers because their duties made them \"near-carbon copies\" of the special trial judges previously deemed officers in *Freytag v. Commissioner*. This establishes a clear methodology: the Court will compare the Task Force's powers to the quasi-judicial powers detailed in *Lucia* and *Freytag* (e.g., taking testimony, conducting trials, ruling on evidence).\n    *   **Crucial Ambiguity Identified:** The *Lucia* opinion, while providing a framework, also introduced a critical ambiguity that will be pivotal in *Braidwood*. Justice Kagan's majority opinion explicitly stated that the quasi-judicial powers in that case were *sufficient* but not necessarily *necessary* to confer officer status. This creates the primary legal uncertainty:\n        *   An argument for the government (HHS) is strengthened: The Task Force members are not \"near-carbon copies\" of ALJs; they don't adjudicate cases, so they lack the requisite \"significant authority.\"\n        *   An argument for the challengers (Braidwood) is also defined: The Task Force's authority to issue recommendations that legally bind private insurers to provide coverage without cost-sharing is a different, but equally \"significant,\" form of authority, even if it's not adjudicatory. The \"sufficient, not necessary\" language from *Lucia* provides the doctrinal hook for this argument.\n    *   **Remedial Path Becomes Clearer:** The remedy in *Lucia*\u2014remanding for a new hearing before a properly appointed judge\u2014reinforces a judicial preference for narrow, tailored remedies that fix the constitutional defect without dismantling the entire administrative scheme. This slightly increases the probability that, if the Court finds an Appointments Clause violation, it will favor an *Arthrex*-style remedy (severing the statutory provision that insulates the Task Force from the HHS Secretary's control) over the more drastic remedy of invalidating all of the Task Force's past and future recommendations.",

The latest observation, an internal consolidation of my reasoning, confirms that the analytical framework derived from recent jurisprudence is complete and robust. I am now shifting from information gathering to predictive modeling, using the established legal tests and identified judicial philosophies to weigh the most likely outcomes.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Confirmed and Solidified):**\n    *   **Controlling Precedents:** The foundational role of *United States v. Germaine*, *Lucia v. SEC*, and *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.* is confirmed. *Lucia* provides the specific test for \"officer\" status, while *Arthrex* provides the primary model for a potential remedy.\n    *   **Core Predictive Framework:** My model, which considers four potential outcomes on the merits and two on the remedy, remains the correct structure. The information gathered has now fully populated this framework with the specific legal arguments and ambiguities the Court will grapple with.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (Synthesized for Prediction):**\n    *   **The *Lucia* Test as the Decisive Factor:** My belief has solidified that the two-prong test from *Lucia v. SEC* is not just relevant but will be the central analytical method used by the Court.\n        1.  **\"Continuing Position\":** I can now state with high confidence that the Task Force members' four-year terms will satisfy this prong and it will not be a point of serious contention.\n        2.  **\"Significant Authority\":** My understanding has evolved to see this as the case's primary battleground. The analysis will hinge on the Court's interpretation of Justice Kagan's \"sufficient, but not necessary\" language from *Lucia*. The core predictive task is to determine if a majority of the Court will agree that the Task Force's power to create binding insurance coverage mandates\u2014a significant regulatory power\u2014is equivalent to the quasi-judicial powers deemed \"significant\" in *Lucia* and *Freytag*.\n    *   **Mapping Arguments to Judicial Philosophy:** The internal synthesis confirms the importance of mapping specific arguments to the known methodologies of the Justices.\n        *   **Formalist/Originalist Path:** For Justices like Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch, the lack of direct presidential control over individuals wielding significant government power is a core constitutional concern. This makes them highly receptive to Braidwood's argument that the Task Force's regulatory authority, even if not adjudicatory, is \"significant.\" This line of reasoning aligns with a formalist interpretation of the Appointments Clause and separation of powers. The Vesting Clause argument, previously identified, serves as a powerful alternative or concurrent argument for this bloc, as it directly addresses the delegation of executive power.\n        *   **Functionalist/Precedent-Bound Path:** For other Justices, the analysis may be more narrowly focused on the analogy to *Lucia*. The government's argument\u2014that Task Force members are not \"near-carbon copies\" of the ALJs in *Lucia* because they do not adjudicate\u2014will appeal to those hesitant to expand the definition of \"officer\" beyond established precedent.\n    *   **High Probability of a Narrow Remedy:** The remedial approaches in both *Lucia* (new hearing) and *Arthrex* (severing a tenure protection provision) create a strong precedent for fixing constitutional defects with minimal disruption. This significantly increases my confidence that if the Court finds an Appointments Clause violation, it will favor severing the provision that insulates the Task Force from the HHS Secretary's supervision. This \"surgical\" remedy would make the Task Force members' recommendations subject to review and ratification by a properly appointed officer (the Secretary), curing the constitutional issue without invalidating the entire preventive care mandate scheme.

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has now reached its final form prior to prediction. The previous synthesis of legal precedents and judicial philosophies has been applied in a final internal reasoning step, collapsing the probabilistic framework into a concrete, high-confidence prediction.\n\n1.  **Stable Beliefs (Foundation of the Final Prediction):**\n    *   **Controlling Precedents:** The analysis remains anchored in *United States v. Germaine*, *Lucia v. SEC*, and *United States v. Arthrex, Inc.*. The two-prong test from *Lucia* for \"officer\" status and the \"surgical\" remedial approach from *Arthrex* are the confirmed cornerstones of the Court's likely methodology.\n    *   **Core Predictive Framework:** The model focusing on the \"significant authority\" prong of the *Lucia* test and the severability question remains the correct and complete lens through which to view the case.\n\n2.  **Evolved Beliefs (Solidified into a Final Prediction):**\n    *   **Prediction on Question 1 (Appointments Clause Violation):** My belief has solidified into a high-confidence prediction that a majority of the Court will find the Task Force's structure violates the Appointments Clause. This is based on the final synthesis that the formalist/originalist interpretation of \"significant authority\" will prevail.\n        *   **Reasoning:** A majority coalition (likely including Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett) will almost certainly conclude that the power to issue recommendations that become binding, nationwide insurance coverage mandates without review by a principal officer is a quintessential exercise of \"significant authority.\" The government's counterargument\u2014that the members are merely advisors\u2014is critically weakened by the automatic legal effect of their decisions. This formalist view, focused on the separation of powers and executive accountability, will override a narrower, functionalist reading that would limit \"officers\" to those with adjudicatory powers.\n    *   **Prediction on Question 2 (Severability):** My belief has also solidified into a high-confidence prediction that the Court will find the provision insulating the Task Force from the HHS Secretary's supervision to be severable.\n        *   **Reasoning:** The Court has a strong and recently reaffirmed preference for narrow remedies that fix constitutional defects while preserving the surrounding statutory scheme (*Arthrex*, *Seila Law v. CFPB*). Invalidating the entire preventive care mandate system would be a massively disruptive outcome that the Court is highly likely to avoid. Severing the provision that prevents the HHS Secretary from reviewing and ratifying the Task Force's decisions is a clean, precedented, and minimally disruptive solution. It cures the constitutional defect by restoring executive control, thereby making the Task Force members' work advisory to a properly appointed officer.\n\nMy understanding has now progressed from information gathering and framework building to a final, synthesized prediction. The analytical components identified in earlier stages have been weighed and applied, leading to the definitive conclusion that the Court will answer \"Yes\" to both legal questions: finding an Appointments Clause violation and remedying it through severability.",
