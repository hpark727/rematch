    "facts_of_the_case": "The United States has grappled with nuclear waste storage since the 1940s, initially from weapons development and later from commercial nuclear power. While spent nuclear fuel was originally intended to be reprocessed, this proved impractical, leading Congress to pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982. The Act designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the nation\u2019s permanent underground repository and required the Department of Energy to begin accepting waste from states by 1998. However, amid strong opposition and delays, the Obama administration halted work on Yucca Mountain and established a Blue Ribbon Commission, which recommended a consent-based approach to siting storage facilities.\n\nFollowing that shift in policy, Waste Control Specialists (as Interim Storage Partners) applied to build a nuclear waste storage facility in Andrews County, Texas. Despite opposition from Texas's governor and legislature, which passed a law prohibiting such storage, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license in September 2021. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the license, holding that neither the Atomic Energy Act nor the Nuclear Waste Policy Act authorized the Commission to license private interim storage facilities.",

This significantly reduces uncertainty about the *process* of solving the task, making subsequent information-gathering actions far more efficient and targeted. The Task EIG is therefore substantial, though not as high as actually executing the search. For design, this action embodies a fundamental and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: break down the case into its legal questions and start by analyzing the primary arguments in the briefs. Reinforcing this structured, source-driven approach provides solid information about good experimental design, even if it's not a novel strategy. The combination makes this a valuable action that sets a strong foundation for the rest of the investigation.",

This brief will provide the entire foundation for one side of the case, dramatically reducing my uncertainty and allowing me to build a concrete model of the legal dispute. Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is moderate; while reading the primary brief is a standard, foundational step, executing this action and observing its high utility provides strong evidence to confirm and calibrate the value of this type of action in my overall strategy. It reinforces that targeting primary briefs early is a highly efficient path to information gain, but it doesn't necessarily teach a novel strategy, hence the lower score compared to the task gain.",

No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), the Hobbs Act (cod-\nified at 28 U.S.C. 2342, 2344), and the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 \n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) are set \nforth at ISP Pet. App. 109a-200a. \nINTRODUCTION \n At the dawn of the atomic age, the use, owner-\nship, and control of nuclear materials and technology \nin this country was strictly a government monopoly.  \nThat changed, however, with the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d).  The AEA \nreflects \u201cCongress\u2019 determination that the national in-\nterest would be best served if the Government encour-\naged the private sector to become involved in the \n\n2 \ndevelopment of atomic energy for peaceful purposes \nunder a program of federal regulation and licensing.\u201d  \nPac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation \n& Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190, 207 (1983).   \nCongress pursued those goals through a newly \ncreated agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, which \nwas tasked with developing the rules, regulations, and \nstandards that would govern the still-new, world-al-\ntering technology of atomic fission.  The degree of re-\nsponsibility assigned to the agency in the AEA was \n\u201cvirtually unique.\u201d  Siegel v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, \n400 F.2d 778, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1968).  A brand-new in-\ndustry was born\u2014one that eventually grew to become \na major component of the nation\u2019s energy and econ-\nomy, now supplying about one fifth of all electricity \nconsumed in the United States.  It is carbon-free and \ndependable baseload power.  Today, new technologies \npresent exciting opportunities to address critical na-\ntional needs for the future.  E.g., Advanced Nuclear - \nPathways to Commercial Liftoff, U.S. DEP\u2019T OF EN-\nERGY, https://liftoff.energy.gov/advanced-nuclear-2/ \n(last visited Nov. 11, 2024). \nThe development of the nuclear energy industry \nin this country, however, has not been linear.  There \nhave been advances and setbacks, as well as periodic \npolitical, and economic, challenges.  And, there has \nbeen the issue of how to deal with spent nuclear fuel.  \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (\u201cNWPA\u201d) \ncharged the Department of Energy with accepting and \npermanently disposing of spent nuclear fuel, starting \nin 1998.  But, as everyone now knows, that did not oc-\ncur, and the Yucca Mountain project remains stalled.  \nUtilities are therefore forced to deal with spent nuclear \n\n3 \nfuel storage issues on a larger scale than anyone would \nhave liked or anticipated. \nThis case grew out of that challenge.  Petitioner \nInterim Storage Partners, LLC seeks to construct an \ninstallation for the temporary storage of spent nuclear \nfuel, adjacent to an existing facility in west Texas li-\ncensed for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  The \nproject has the potential to alleviate pressures on the \ndomestic nuclear power industry, and to save hun-\ndreds of millions of dollars through efficiencies and \neconomies of scale.  One cannot, however, simply em-\nbark upon such a project alone.  Permission\u2014a \u201cli-\ncense\u201d\u2014is required from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), which succeeded \nthe Atomic Energy Commission as the regulator of nu-\nclear safety.  Obtaining that license is a monumental \nundertaking.  There are reams of required environ-\nmental and safety analyses (including a 500-page draft \nand 700-page final environmental impact statement in \nthis case), public engagement, multiple scoping meet-\nings, requests for supplemental information, robust \nopportunities for review and opposition, and potential \nadjudication of contentions and issues, all pursuant to \nrules, regulations, and legal principles that have be-\ncome substantially settled since the industry grew \nfrom nothing half a century ago to what it is today. \nAnd all of that happened here\u2014ISP spent years, \nand millions of dollars, to secure its NRC license.  Mul-\ntiple environmental groups and other entities opposed \nthe project.  Agency administrative boards were con-\nvened and addressed the arguments raised, and the \nCommission heard and resolved multiple appeals.  The \nD.C. Circuit then heard the legal challenges, \n\n4 \neventually affirming the NRC issuance of the license \nto ISP.  The State of New Mexico, having eschewed the \nagency procedures for opposing the project, neverthe-\nless filed a petition for review in the Tenth Circuit, \nwhich the Tenth Circuit dismissed. \nThen, in response to petitions for review filed by \nthe State of Texas and Fasken, the Fifth Circuit went \noff the rails.  Unlike the Tenth Circuit (and every other \ncircuit court to address such issues), the court deter-\nmined to hear the case even though the requirements \nof the governing judicial review provision, the Hobbs \nAct, were not met by the petitioners (because they in-\ntentionally declined to avail themselves of the well-\nknown agency processes).  To do so, the Fifth Circuit \nresurrected its seemingly dormant judge-made \u201cultra \nvires exception,\u201d whereby a mere allegation that an \nagency exceeded its legal authority automatically en-\ntitles a litigant to judicial review, even if that litigant \nis not authorized to sue by the review statute.  And, on \nthe merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the NRC had no \nauthority under the AEA to do what it had been doing \nfor many decades (i.e., license temporary away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel), and that the \nNWPA did not permit the issuance of the license.  In \nso holding, the Fifth Circuit misapplied basic princi-\nples of statutory interpretation, ignored regulations \nexpressly contemplating such projects that have been \non the books since 1980, and broke with every other \ncircuit that has addressed the issue. \nThe repercussions of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors are \ndestabilizing, and potentially devastating, to a critical \nindustry at a critical time.  Respectfully, this Court \nshould reverse. \n\n5 \nSTATEMENT \nI.\nLegal framework.  \n1.\nLess than ten years after Hiroshima, Congress \npassed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Pub. L. No. 83-\n703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d), to further peaceful uses of atomic \nenergy.  The purposes of the AEA included \u201cdevelop-\nment, use, and control of atomic energy * * * so as to \nmake the maximum contribution to the general wel-\nfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), and to \u201cimprove the general \nwelfare, increase the standard of living, and \nstrengthen free competition in private enterprise.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 2011(b).  Congress found that the development, \nutilization, and control of atomic energy was \u201cvital to \nthe common defense and security.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(a).  \nA central purpose of the AEA was to maximize peace-\nful development and utilization of atomic energy.  42 \nU.S.C. 2013(d).  See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State \nEnergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. \n190, 207 (1983) (AEA enacted to \u201cencourage[\u200a] the pri-\nvate sector\u201d to develop \u201catomic energy for peaceful pur-\nposes under a program of federal regulation and li-\ncensing\u201d). \nThe AEA created a new agency, the Atomic Energy \nCommission.  Among its chief tasks was to oversee the \npossession and use of nuclear materials.  Congress \nfound that \u201cthe processing and utilization of source, \nbyproduct, and special nuclear material affect inter-\nstate and foreign commerce and must be regulated in \nthe national interest,\u201d and that the \u201cprocessing and \nutilization of source, byproduct, and special nuclear \nmaterial must be regulated in the national interest \nand in order to provide for the common defense and \n\n6 \nsecurity and to protect the health and safety of the \npublic.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(c), (d).  To that end, Congress \nbroadly tasked the AEA to \u201cestablish by rule, regula-\ntion, or order, such standards and instructions to gov-\nern the possession and use of special nuclear material, \nsource material, and byproduct material as the Com-\nmission may deem necessary or desirable to promote \nthe common defense and security or to protect health \nor to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b). \nSpent nuclear fuel fits squarely within this ex-\npress delegation of authority.  It is composed of \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d such as enriched uranium and \nplutonium, \u201csource material,\u201d such as natural ura-\nnium, and \u201cbyproduct \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 \n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) are set \nforth at ISP Pet. App. 109a-200a. \nINTRODUCTION \n At the dawn of the atomic age, the use, owner-\nship, and control of nuclear materials and technology \nin this country was strictly a government monopoly.  \nThat changed, however, with the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d).  The AEA \nreflects \u201cCongress\u2019 determination that the national in-\nterest would be best served if the Government encour-\naged the private sector to become involved in the \n\n2 \ndevelopment of atomic energy for peaceful purposes \nunder a program of federal regulation and licensing.\u201d  \nPac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation \n& Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190, 207 (1983).   \nCongress pursued those goals through a newly \ncreated agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, which \nwas tasked with developing the rules, regulations, and \nstandards that would govern the still-new, world-al-\ntering technology of atomic fission.  The degree of re-\nsponsibility assigned to the agency in the AEA was \n\u201cvirtually unique.\u201d  Siegel v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, \n400 F.2d 778, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1968).  A brand-new in-\ndustry was born\u2014one that eventually grew to become \na major component of the nation\u2019s energy and econ-\nomy, now supplying about one fifth of all electricity \nconsumed in the United States.  It is carbon-free and \ndependable baseload power.  Today, new technologies \npresent exciting opportunities to address critical na-\ntional needs for the future.  E.g., Advanced Nuclear - \nPathways to Commercial Liftoff, U.S. DEP\u2019T OF EN-\nERGY, https://liftoff.energy.gov/advanced-nuclear-2/ \n(last visited Nov. 11, 2024). \nThe development of the nuclear energy industry \nin this country, however, has not been linear.  There \nhave been advances and setbacks, as well as periodic \npolitical, and economic, challenges.  And, there has \nbeen the issue of how to deal with spent nuclear fuel.  \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (\u201cNWPA\u201d) \ncharged the Department of Energy with accepting and \npermanently disposing of spent nuclear fuel, starting \nin 1998.  But, as everyone now knows, that did not oc-\ncur, and the Yucca Mountain project remains stalled.  \nUtilities are therefore forced to deal with spent nuclear \n\n3 \nfuel storage issues on a larger scale than anyone would \nhave liked or anticipated. \nThis case grew out of that challenge.  Petitioner \nInterim Storage Partners, LLC seeks to construct an \ninstallation for the temporary storage of spent nuclear \nfuel, adjacent to an existing facility in west Texas li-\ncensed for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.  The \nproject has the potential to alleviate pressures on the \ndomestic nuclear power industry, and to save hun-\ndreds of millions of dollars through efficiencies and \neconomies of scale.  One cannot, however, simply em-\nbark upon such a project alone.  Permission\u2014a \u201cli-\ncense\u201d\u2014is required from the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d), which succeeded \nthe Atomic Energy Commission as the regulator of nu-\nclear safety.  Obtaining that license is a monumental \nundertaking.  There are reams of required environ-\nmental and safety analyses (including a 500-page draft \nand 700-page final environmental impact statement in \nthis case), public engagement, multiple scoping meet-\nings, requests for supplemental information, robust \nopportunities for review and opposition, and potential \nadjudication of contentions and issues, all pursuant to \nrules, regulations, and legal principles that have be-\ncome substantially settled since the industry grew \nfrom nothing half a century ago to what it is today. \nAnd all of that happened here\u2014ISP spent years, \nand millions of dollars, to secure its NRC license.  Mul-\ntiple environmental groups and other entities opposed \nthe project.  Agency administrative boards were con-\nvened and addressed the arguments raised, and the \nCommission heard and resolved multiple appeals.  The \nD.C. Circuit then heard the legal challenges, \n\n4 \neventually affirming the NRC issuance of the license \nto ISP.  The State of New Mexico, having eschewed the \nagency procedures for opposing the project, neverthe-\nless filed a petition for review in the Tenth Circuit, \nwhich the Tenth Circuit dismissed. \nThen, in response to petitions for review filed by \nthe State of Texas and Fasken, the Fifth Circuit went \noff the rails.  Unlike the Tenth Circuit (and every other \ncircuit court to address such issues), the court deter-\nmined to hear the case even though the requirements \nof the governing judicial review provision, the Hobbs \nAct, were not met by the petitioners (because they in-\ntentionally declined to avail themselves of the well-\nknown agency processes).  To do so, the Fifth Circuit \nresurrected its seemingly dormant judge-made \u201cultra \nvires exception,\u201d whereby a mere allegation that an \nagency exceeded its legal authority automatically en-\ntitles a litigant to judicial review, even if that litigant \nis not authorized to sue by the review statute.  And, on \nthe merits, the Fifth Circuit held that the NRC had no \nauthority under the AEA to do what it had been doing \nfor many decades (i.e., license temporary away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel), and that the \nNWPA did not permit the issuance of the license.  In \nso holding, the Fifth Circuit misapplied basic princi-\nples of statutory interpretation, ignored regulations \nexpressly contemplating such projects that have been \non the books since 1980, and broke with every other \ncircuit that has addressed the issue. \nThe repercussions of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s errors are \ndestabilizing, and potentially devastating, to a critical \nindustry at a critical time.  Respectfully, this Court \nshould reverse. \n\n5 \nSTATEMENT \nI.\nLegal framework.  \n1.\nLess than ten years after Hiroshima, Congress \npassed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Pub. L. No. 83-\n703, 68 Stat. 919 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n2011 et seq.) (\u201cAEA\u201d), to further peaceful uses of atomic \nenergy.  The purposes of the AEA included \u201cdevelop-\nment, use, and control of atomic energy * * * so as to \nmake the maximum contribution to the general wel-\nfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), and to \u201cimprove the general \nwelfare, increase the standard of living, and \nstrengthen free competition in private enterprise.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 2011(b).  Congress found that the development, \nutilization, and control of atomic energy was \u201cvital to \nthe common defense and security.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(a).  \nA central purpose of the AEA was to maximize peace-\nful development and utilization of atomic energy.  42 \nU.S.C. 2013(d).  See, e.g., Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State \nEnergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. \n190, 207 (1983) (AEA enacted to \u201cencourage[\u200a] the pri-\nvate sector\u201d to develop \u201catomic energy for peaceful pur-\nposes under a program of federal regulation and li-\ncensing\u201d). \nThe AEA created a new agency, the Atomic Energy \nCommission.  Among its chief tasks was to oversee the \npossession and use of nuclear materials.  Congress \nfound that \u201cthe processing and utilization of source, \nbyproduct, and special nuclear material affect inter-\nstate and foreign commerce and must be regulated in \nthe national interest,\u201d and that the \u201cprocessing and \nutilization of source, byproduct, and special nuclear \nmaterial must be regulated in the national interest \nand in order to provide for the common defense and \n\n6 \nsecurity and to protect the health and safety of the \npublic.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2012(c), (d).  To that end, Congress \nbroadly tasked the AEA to \u201cestablish by rule, regula-\ntion, or order, such standards and instructions to gov-\nern the possession and use of special nuclear material, \nsource material, and byproduct material as the Com-\nmission may deem necessary or desirable to promote \nthe common defense and security or to protect health \nor to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b). \nSpent nuclear fuel fits squarely within this ex-\npress delegation of authority.  It is composed of \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d such as enriched uranium and \nplutonium, \u201csource material,\u201d such as natural ura-\nnium, and \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d which includes other \nradioactive material produced by nuclear fission.  ISP \nPet. App. 22a; see 42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(3)(a) and (aa) (de-\nfining terms).  In addition to 42 U.S.C. 2201(b), which \ncharged the Commission with developing rules and \nregulations for the possession and use of such materi-\nals, separate provisions addressed \u201cdomestic distribu-\ntion\u201d of each of the constituent elements of spent nu-\nclear fuel and authorized the Commission to issue li-\ncenses to private parties to possess such materials for \nvarious purposes.  42 U.S.C. 2073, 2092, 2093, 2111.   \nThe different enumerated purposes for licensing of \nspecial nuclear material and source material included \ncertain research and development activities, medical \ntherapy, and use in production (e.g., certain isotope \nproduction) and utilization (e.g., nuclear power plant) \nfacilities.  And, separately and importantly, for \u201csuch \nother uses as the commission determines to be appro-\npriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter\u201d (42 \n\n7 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(4))1 and \u201cfor any other use approved by \nthe Commission as an aid to science or industry.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 2093(a)(4).  The identified purposes for licens-\ning of byproduct materials included research and med-\nical uses, as well as \u201cindustrial uses\u201d and \u201csuch other \nuseful applications as may be developed.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2111(a). \n2.\nCongress amended the AEA in 1974 to create \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d or \u201cCom-\nmission\u201d), an independent regulatory commission \nwhich assumed the broad authority under the AEA to \nregulate the civilian possession and use of radioactive \nmaterials.  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, Pub. L. \nNo. 93-438, 88 Stat. 1233.  That amendment also cre-\nated a separate agency, which ultimately became the \nDepartment of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d), which assumed devel-\nopmental functions from the Atomic Energy Commis-\nsion. \n3.\nIn 1978, pursuant to the above-noted provisions \nof the AEA, the NRC issued a proposed rule for notice \nand comment.  The rule, which provided for the pos-\nsession of spent nuclear fuel \u201cat installations built spe-\ncifically for this [storage] that are not coupled to either \na nuclear power plant or a fuel reprocessing plant.\u201d  \n1 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) was added in 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-\n681, 72 Stat. 632 (Aug. 19, 1958).  That addition was a \u201ccorrection \nof a drafting deficiency\u201d and \u201cnot a material change,\u201d to confirm \nthat the AEC had authority to issue licenses for \u201cindustrial use of \nspecial nuclear material\u201d that were \u201cnot strictly research and de-\nvelopment.\u201d  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Legislation of \nthe Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, at 12, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. \n(July 10, 17, and 18, 1958) (statement of Mr. Hollingworth, Assis-\ntant General Manager for Administration, Atomic Energy Com-\nmission). \n\n8 \nStorage of Spent Nuclear Fuel in an Independent \nSpent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI): Proposed \nRule, 43 Fed. Reg. 46,309 (Oct. 6, 1978).  After exten-\nsive public comments (none of which challenged the \nNRC\u2019s authority to promulgate such a rule), the NRC \npromulgated a final rule to that effect in 1980.  Licens-\ning Requirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an \nIndependent Fuel Spent Storage Installation, 45 Fed. \nReg. 74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980).  These regulations have \ntherefore been on the books at 10 C.F.R. Part 72 for \nmore than forty years. \n4.\nIn the many decades since, the NRC has been \nopen, public, and transparent about its exercise of the \nauthority to license interim away-from-reactor storage \nof spent nuclear fuel.  E.g., General Electric Co.; Re-\nnewal of Materials License for the Storage of Spent \nFuel, 47 Fed. Reg. 20,231 (May 11, 1982) (renewal of \nmaterials license SNM-2500 for away-from-reactor \nspent fuel storage facility in Morris, Illinois); Public \nService Co. of Colorado; Issuance of Materials License \nSNM-2504, Ft. St. Vrain Independent Spent Fuel Stor-\nage; Installation at the Ft. St. Vrain Nuclear Generat-\ning Station, 56 Fed. Reg. 57,539 (Nov. 12, 1991) (ma-\nterials license issued under 10 C.F.R. Part 72 at site of \ndecommissioning reactor); Private Fuel Storage, Lim-\nited Liability Company; Notice of Issuance of Materi-\nals License SNM-2513 for the Private Fuel Storage Fa-\ncility, 71 Fed. Reg. 10,068 (Feb. 28, 2006) (materials \nlicense for away-from-reactor spent fuel storage facil-\nity in Tooele County, Utah).  See also Bullcreek v. \nNRC, 359 F.3d 536, 543 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (noting the \nexistence of three \u201cprivate away-from-reactor storage \nfacilities\u201d at the time of the passage of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act in 1982; 45 Fed. Reg. at 74,698). \n\n9 \n5.\nTwo years after the NRC promulgated Part 72 \nof Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \nCongress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, \nPub. L. No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 (codified as amended \nat 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) (\u201cNWPA\u201d).  Congress was \nfully aware of the NRC\u2019s Part 72 away-from-reactor \nspent nuclear fuel storage regulations, and aware also \nthat the NRC had asserted authority under the AEA \nto license such possession of spent nuclear fuel.  E.g., \nS. REP. NO. 97-282, at 44 (1981).  Although the AEA is \nmentioned several times in the text of the NWPA (e.g., \n42 U.S.C. 10141(b), 10155(a)(1)(A)(i)), there is no \nreference to, much less a revocation of, the NRC\u2019s Part \n72 authority under the AEA to license away-from-\nreactor storage of spent nuclear fuel. \nThe NWPA created a comprehensive scheme for \nthe ownership and permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel by DOE, not private parties.  It created ac-\nceptance and disposal duties regarding spent nuclear \nfuel on the part of DOE, not the NRC.  See Don\u2019t Waste \nMich. v. NRC, No. 21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *1 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023) (\u201cStorage and disposal, how-\never, are different concepts.\u201d).  Congress designated \nYucca Mountain, Nevada as the permanent disposal \nrepository site, Pub. L. No. 107-200, 116 Stat. 735 \n(2002), but DOE efforts to license the project with the \nNRC, and then construct and operate Yucca Mountain, \nhave effectively ceased, and the project remains \ndormant.  See In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 257-\n259 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  Accordingly, DOE is in breach of \nits acceptance and disposal obligations under the \nNWPA.  E.g., Ind. Mich. Power Co. v. United States, \n422 F.3d 1369, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\u201cpartial breach\u201d).  \nPrivate parties are therefore being forced to store \n\n10 \nspent nuclear fuel in larger quantities, and for longer \ndurations, than Congress, or anyone else, desired or \nexpected.  E.g., Texas v. United States, 891 F.3d 553, \n555 (5th Cir. 2018). \n6.\nThe AEA allows any person whose interest may \nbe affected by the issuance of a license to request a \nhearing before the NRC.  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  Ju-\nrisdiction for courts to review challenges to such li-\ncenses is granted by the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. 2344, \nwhich is exclusive and which limits judicial review to \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the agency proceeding\u2014that is, \na person who has become a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency pro-\nceeding.  If a person is denied \u201cparty\u201d status by the \nagency, then that determination itself is appealable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2239(b)(1).  Thus, to be able to \npursue judicial review under the statute, a person \nmust either be a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency proceeding, or \nat least have attempted to become a \u201cparty\u201d to those \nproceedings.  This jurisdictional provision of the Hobbs \nAct applies not just to the NRC, but also to the Federal \nCommunications Commission, Department of Agricul-\nture, Department of Transportation, Federal Maritime \nCommission, and Surface Transportation Board.  28 \nU.S.C. 2342(1)-(7). \nII.\nFacts and proceedings below.  \n1.\nIn April 2016, one of ISP\u2019s joint venture mem-\nbers submitted an application (subsequently assumed \nand pursued by ISP) to the NRC for a license to tem-\nporarily store spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear \npower facilities at a consolidated interim storage facil-\nity.  The facility was to be constructed adjacent to, but \nseparate from, an existing low-level radiological waste \ndisposal facility in Andrews County, Texas.   \n\n11 \nInitially, ISP had strong support from the State of \nTexas, as well as from local communities in west \nTexas.  Then-Governor Rick Perry called for a Texas \nsolution to the issue of temporary storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel, rather than ceding the efforts to potential \nprojects in other states.  J.A. 1.  The Texas Radiation \nAdvisory Board issued a position stating that it was in \nthe state\u2019s best interest to support a facility in the \nstate, and Andrews County passed a unanimous reso-\nlution in support.  J.A. 6. \n2.\nIn August 2018, the NRC published notice of its \nconsideration of the license application in the Federal \nRegister pursuant to its regulations, along with in-\nstructions regarding how interested parties and enti-\nties could petition for a hearing and intervene in the \nNRC proceedings. \nA number of parties made various filings with the \nNRC between September and November 2018, chal-\nlenging the issuance of the license on multiple \ngrounds.  Challenges included assertions that the pro-\nposed license violated the NWPA because it was based \nupon an assumption that DOE would illegally take ti-\ntle to spent nuclear fuel, and that the license could not \nlegally be granted because of failures of the NRC to \ncomply with the National Environmental Policy Act in \nvarious ways.  Fasken was one of the parties who tried \nto challenge the license at the agency level, seeking to \nassert an out-of-time contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the environmental im-\npact statement, and to reopen the evidentiary record \nbased upon alleged deficiencies in the environmental \nreport regarding transportation routes.  An NRC ad-\nministrative hearings board ultimately dismissed or \n\n12 \ndenied all of the challenges, and those determinations \nwere upheld by the full Commission upon appeal.  In \nre Interim Storage Partners LLC, CLI-20-13, 92 N.R.C. \n457 (Dec. 4, 2020); In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, \nCLI-20-14, 92 N.R.C. 463 (Dec. 17, 2020); In re Interim \nStorage Partners LLC, CLI-20-15, 92 N.R.C. 491 (Dec. \n17, 2020); In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, CLI-21-\n09, 93 N.R.C. 244 (June 22, 2021). \nMeanwhile, Texas, now governed by a new admin-\nistration, had reversed its position and opposed the \nproject.  However, Texas elected not to participate in \nthe NRC adjudicatory proceedings pursuant to the \nNRC\u2019s rules, as states and interested parties fre-\nquently do.  E.g., 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h).  Instead, Texas \nsubmitted comment letters to the NRC regarding a \ndraft Environmental Impact Statement.  J.A. 115-122.  \nAnd, on the eve of the issuance of the license, Texas \nobjected upon the basis of a just-passed Texas law pro-\nhibiting the storage of spent nuclear fuel in the state.  \nJ.A. 215-216. \n3.\nVarious of the groups that had properly sought \nto participate in the NRC adjudicatory process, includ-\ning Fasken, filed petitions in the D.C. Circuit under \nthe Hobbs Act.  The D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed \nor denied all of those petitions on the merits.  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *2-3.  As to the vio-\nlation-of-NWPA claims, the court observed that the li-\ncense contemplated storage of privately owned spent \nnuclear fuel, and the AEA and implementing regula-\ntions \u201cpermit[\u200a] the NRC \u2018to license and regulate the \nstorage and disposal of [spent nuclear] fuel.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (quoting Bull-\ncreek, 359 F.3d at 538).  The court dismissed separate \n\n13 \nlate-filed appeals purporting to challenge the issuance \nof the license itself (as distinguished from the NRC ad-\njudicatory orders), on the grounds that the petitioners\u2019 \nfailures to assert such claims before the NRC meant \nthat they could not establish that they were \u201cparties \naggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., \n2023 WL 395030, at *3 (citing Ohio Nuclear-Free Net-\nwork v. NRC, 53 F.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022)).  Fi-\nnally, as to Fasken\u2019s claims that the NRC had erred by \nrefusing to admit Fasken\u2019s late-filed contention and \ndeclining to reopen the record, the court held that \n\u201c[n]either claim has merit.\u201d  Ibid.\n4.\nThe State of New Mexico, like Texas, also did \nnot participate in the NRC adjudicatory process, but \nfiled a challenge to the license in the Tenth Circuit.  \nThat court dismissed the petition for review due to \nNew Mexico\u2019s failure to participate as required at the \nagency level.  State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n1112, 1124 (10th Cir. 2023). \n5.\nTexas, along with Fasken, filed petitions in the \nFifth Circuit, challenging the NRC\u2019s issuance of the li-\ncense on multiple grounds.  ISP intervened.  The NRC \nmoved to dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction \nunder the Hobbs Act.  The court carried that motion \nwith the case. \nThe Fifth Circuit rejected the NRC\u2019s standing and \njurisdictional challenges to the Texas and Fasken pe-\ntitions.  The court, in dicta, expressed disagreement \nwith the D.C. Circuit and \u201cat least one other circuit\u201d \nregarding interpretation of the Hobbs Act\u2019s aggrieved-\nparty requirement.  ISP Pet. App. 10a-21a; see Ohio \nNuclear-Free Network, 53 F.4th at 239; Balderas, 59 \nF.4th at 1117.  But then, as the panel\u2019s actual basis for \n\n14 \nhearing the case, the Fifth Circuit applied a purported \n\u201cultra vires exception\u201d to statutory standing require-\nments under the Hobbs Act.  ISP Pet. App. 19a.  The \nFifth Circuit acknowledged that the \u201cultra vires\u201d posi-\ntion upon which it rested jurisdiction had not been \nadopted by any other circuit and had been expressly \nrejected by the Second, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh \nCircuits.  ISP Pet. App. 19a n.3. \nThe Fifth Circuit therefore determined to reach \nthe merits of the subset of arguments by Texas and \nFasken that the court deemed to be claims of \u201cultra \nvires\u201d agency action.  ISP Pet. App. 19a.  In doing so, \nit held that the AEA does not authorize the Commis-\nsion to license a private, away-from reactor storage fa-\ncility for spent nuclear fuel, dismissing contrary rul-\nings by the D.C. Circuit (in Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538), \nand the Tenth Circuit (in Skull Valley Band of Goshute \nIndians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. \n2004)), as \u201cunpersuasive\u201d and \u201cunhelpful\u201d based upon \na lack of \u201ctextual analysis\u201d of the AEA in those deci-\nsions.  ISP Pet. App. 21a-26a.  The Fifth Circuit fur-\nther held that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the activity \nauthorized by the ISP license.  ISP Pet. App. 21a-30a.  \nFinally, the Fifth Circuit observed that treatment of \nnuclear waste \u201chas been hotly contested for over a half \ncentury.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  That debate supposedly \nimplicated the \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine described in \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), which the \nFifth Circuit held to further support its result. \n6.\nThe government and ISP each moved for re-\nhearing en banc.  By a 9-7 vote of eligible judges, the \nfull court denied review.  ISP Pet. App. 33a.  A concur-\nrence of six judges expanded on the panel\u2019s dicta \n\n15 \nregarding the Hobbs Act, and further elaborated on \nthe ultra vires doctrine on which the panel rested ju-\nrisdiction.  A dissent of four judges explained that the \ncourt\u2019s \u201cexercise of jurisdiction has grave consequences \nfor regulated entities\u2019 settled expectations and careful \ninvestments in costly, time-consuming agency pro-\nceedings, inviting spoilers to sidestep the avenues for \nparticipation that Congress carefully crafted to pre-\nvent this uncertainty.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 46a (Higginson, \nJ., dissenting). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Fifth Circuit made multiple consequential er-\nrors in this case.  This Court should correct those er-\nrors and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. \nFirst, the Fifth Circuit should not have enter-\ntained the petitions by Texas and Fasken.  To do so, it \nresurrected an atextual \u201cultra vires exception\u201d to the \nHobbs Act\u2019s judicial review provisions.  Under that \ndoctrine, a mere allegation that an agency exceeded its \nstatutory authority automatically allows a circuit \ncourt to hear the challenge, regardless of the standing \nrequirements imposed by the statute.  That doctrine\u2014\nwhich before this case seemed destined for the dustbin \nof history\u2014was originally based on dubious dicta from \na 1982 Fifth Circuit decision.  Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, \nInc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d 82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982).  Since \nthen, every single time that the doctrine has been con-\nsidered by another circuit, it has been rejected, creat-\ning splits between the Fifth Circuit and the Second, \nSeventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  State ex rel. \nBalderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th 1112, 1123-1124 (10th Cir. \n2023); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State Util. Consumer Advocs. v. \nFCC, 457 F.3d 1238, 1249 (11th Cir. 2006), modified \n\n16 \non other grounds on denial of reh\u2019g, 468 F.3d 1272 \n(11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); Erie-Niagara Rail Steer-\ning Comm. v. Surface Trans. Bd., 167 F.3d 111, 112-\n113 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); In re: Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d 317, 334-335 (7th Cir. \n1986).  As those other circuits have cogently explained, \nnot only is the doctrine unsupported, it is arbitrary \nand unworkable.  A clever litigant can frame many al-\nlegations of wrongful agency action as the agency \u201cex-\nceeding its authority,\u201d which would effectively render \nCongress\u2019s judicial review limitations meaningless.  \nThat is judicial aggrandizement of the highest order, \nand the Court should reject it. \nSecond, the Court should reject any argument that \nrespondents might make that they are \u201cparties ag-\ngrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndicta on this point cannot be reconciled with the actual \nstatutory language.  In the Hobbs Act, Congress lim-\nited judicial review to a \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n2344 (emphasis added).  Not a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d  \nThat word-choice is intentional and meaningful\u2014to be \na \u201cparty,\u201d under well-understood definitions of the \nterm, one must actually participate in the agency pro-\nceeding pursuant to its rules (or, at the very least, seek \nto so participate).  E.g., Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, \n43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.).  Merely firing off objec-\ntions does not make one a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency pro-\nceedings under the Hobbs Act, when agency rules re-\nquire more.  Every other circuit that has considered \nthe issue has so held.  E.g., Ohio Nuclear-Free Network \nv. NRC, 53 F.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also, \ne.g., Gage v. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d \n1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Balderas, 59 F.4th \nat 1116-1119. \n\n17 \nThird, on the merits, the Fifth Circuit misinter-\npreted the AEA.  The court erroneously concluded that \nthe statute never in fact authorized the NRC to ap-\nprove licenses for away-from-reactor temporary stor-\nage of spent nuclear fuel.  It did so even though the \nstatute charges the NRC with regulating \u201cpossession \nand use\u201d of each of the constituent elements of spent \nnuclear fuel in furtherance of development of atomic \npower, without locational restrictions.  42 U.S.C. \n2201(b); 2011(a); 2012(c), (d).  And, even though the \nstatute empowered the NRC to license possession and \nuse of the constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \nfor uses determined by the agency to be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nfor carrying out the purposes of the AEA, as an \u201caid to \nscience or industry,\u201d and for \u201cindustrial uses,\u201d all of \nwhich comfortably encompass the temporary storage \nof civilian spent nuclear fuel, and none of which im-\npose geographic or locational restrictions.  42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), 2111(a).  And, even though NRC \nregulations providing for away-from-reactor storage of \nspent nuclear fuel\u2014published after extensive notice \nand comment rulemaking and in use for decades\u2014\nhave been on the books since 1980.  10 C.F.R. Part 72.  \nAnd, even though every other circuit that has looked \nat the issue has rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading.  \nSee Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 965 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538; Skull Val-\nley, 376 F.3d at 1232. \nTo get there, the Fifth Circuit invoked a sort of \nejusdem generis-type approach to infer that temporary \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel may only be for \u201cresearch \nand development\u201d purposes.  ISP Pet. App. 22a.  The \nFifth Circuit, however, inexplicably failed to consider \nthe statutory provisions that did not fit its desired \n\n18 \nresult.  Moreover, the relevant statutory language and \nstructures\u2014which involved no \u201clist\u201d nor any \u201ccommon\u201d \nlink or attribute\u2014are in any event not susceptible to \nthe type of interpretive restriction imposed by the \nFifth Circuit.  E.g., Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, \nL.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2082 (2024); Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 225 (2008).  At bottom, the \nFifth Circuit and respondents fundamentally err in at \nleast two ways: (a) by impermissibly reading im-\nportant portions of the statute as meaningless, see \nCorley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009); and \n(b) by impermissibly imposing a material condition, \nnamely an \u201cat-reactor\u201d locational limitation on the \ntemporary storage of spent nuclear fuel, that cannot \nbe found in the statute.  E.g., Borden v. United States, \n593 U.S. 420, 436 (2021); Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fos-\nsil, Inc., 590 U.S. 212, 215 (2020). \nFourth, nothing in the statute supports the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s alternative holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t \npermit\u201d the license at issue here.  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  \nNor can the result by the Fifth Circuit be justified by \nsome purported \u201cpolicy,\u201d \u201ccontext,\u201d or \u201cscheme\u201d of the \nNWPA.  ISP Pet. App. 21a, 29a, 30a.  On the contrary, \nthe \u201ccontext\u201d of the NWPA is Congress\u2019s awareness of \nthe NRC\u2019s preexisting authority under the AEA to do \nexactly what it did in this case, which the NWPA did \nnothing to repeal or question.  See S. REP. NO. 97-282, \nat 44 (1981); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  The NWPA is \nself-evidently concerned with permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel by the DOE, not temporary storage\nof spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  E.g., Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (\u201cStorage and dis-\nposal, however, are different concepts.\u201d).  Every other \ncircuit that has looked at the NWPA\u2019s application to \n\n19 \nthis issue has concluded exactly the opposite of what \nthe Fifth Circuit held here.  Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at \n1232-1233; Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121; Beyond \nNuclear, 113 F.4th at 965.  Once again, those circuits \nwere correct, and the Fifth Circuit here was not. \nARGUMENT \nI.\nThe Fifth Circuit Erred by Applying a \nJudge-Made \u201cUltra Vires Exception\u201d to \nStatutory Hobbs Act Requirements. \nThe Fifth Circuit erred by hearing this case at all \npursuant to its atextual, judge-made \u201cultra vires\u201d ex-\nception to Hobbs Act requirements.  In the Hobbs Act, \nCongress granted courts of appeals exclusive jurisdic-\ntion to review certain final orders of identified agen-\ncies, providing (in 28 U.S.C. 2342) that such \u201c[j]uris-\ndiction is invoked by filing a petition\u201d pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. 2344.  The latter provision provides that \u201c[a]ny \nparty aggrieved\u201d may file suit in a court of appeals \nwithin sixty days of the final agency order to be chal-\nlenged.  The Fifth Circuit did not base its exercise of \njurisdiction on any finding that Texas and Fasken \nwere \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  There \nis no textual support in the Hobbs Act, or any other \nstatute, for the ultra vires exception resurrected and \napplied by the Fifth Circuit to hear this case.  That \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction was erroneous \nand should be reversed.  E.g., Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 214 (2007) (courts have \u201cno authority to cre-\nate equitable exceptions to jurisdictional require-\nments.\u201d). \nFirst, the doctrine contravenes the long-settled \nrule that courts of appeals have no authority to exer-\ncise jurisdiction that Congress withheld from them.  \n\n20 \nSee, e.g., Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. 441, 449 (1850). Fed-\neral courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and they \ncannot expand the powers that a statute confers on \nthem by judicial decree.  See, e.g., Kokkonen v. Guard-\nian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule has never been \nsufficiently justified\u2014even by the Fifth Circuit itself.  \nThe genesis of the ultra vires doctrine was a footnote, \nin dicta, in a 1982 Fifth Circuit decision involving the \nInterstate Commerce Commission.  Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, Inc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d 82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982).  \nThat footnote contained no rationale or substantive \nanalysis, and exclusively cited ICC cases before 1975, \ni.e., before the ICC was even brought within the ambit \nof the Hobbs Act.  See Act of Jan. 2, 1975, Pub. L. No. \n93-584, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 88 Stat. 1917 (1975).  Indeed, the actual \nholding of American Trucking was that intervention \nbefore the agency was, in fact, required as a prerequi-\nsite to judicial review under 28 U.S.C. 2344.  Am. \nTrucking, 673 F.2d at 85 (citing S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 961 (D.C. Cir. 1976); Gage\nv. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-\n1221 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).  Two years later in a challenge \nto a rulemaking proceeding, the Fifth Circuit noted the \ndicta from the American Trucking footnote to enter-\ntain claims brought by non-parties to an ICC order, \nagain without analysis, discussion, nor citation to any \npost-1975 ICC Hobbs Act (or other) cases.  Wales \nTransp., Inc. v. ICC, 728 F.2d 774, 776 n.1 (5th Cir. \n1984).   \nThe Fifth Circuit itself has recognized the outlier \nstatus of its ultra vires doctrine.  E.g., ISP Pet. App. \n19a n.3, 42a n.5; see Merchs. Fast Motor Lines, Inc. v. \n\n21 \nICC, 5 F.3d 911, 922 n.16 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting that \n\u201cat least one other circuit\u201d declined to recognize the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s doctrine).  Yet rather than simply take \nthe opportunity upon en banc review in this case to \nalign itself with the correct majority view, the Fifth \nCircuit doubled down and resurrected the long-\ndormant principle. \nBelow, the six-judge opinion supporting the denial \nof en banc review identified no statutory basis for the \ncourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, but belatedly defended \nthe panel\u2019s decision by invoking Leedom v. Kyne, 358 \nU.S. 184, 188 (1958), on which neither the panel nor \nthe parties had relied.  ISP Pet. App. 43a.  As the dis-\nsenting opinion correctly noted, however, this Court \nsubsequently clarified that Kyne has no applicability \nwhere, as here, there is a meaningful and adequate op-\nportunity for judicial review under the relevant stat-\nute.  ISP Pet. App. 51a n.2 (citing Bd. of Governors of \nFed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 \n(1991)).  Indeed, even the opinion supporting denial of \nen banc review \u201cagree[d]\u201d that this Court clarified \nKyne in MCorp.  ISP Pet. App. 43a n.6.  In short, there \nis no statutory authority or judicial precedent to sup-\nport what the Fifth Circuit did here. \nSecond, the uniform contrary precedent rejecting \nthe doctrine is compelling.  After American Trucking\nand Wales Transportation, litigants in other circuits \nperiodically tried to sidestep Hobbs Act requirements \nthrough the ultra vires grounds recited by the Fifth \nCircuit.  Those efforts were consistently, and persua-\nsively, rejected.  State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n1112, 1123-1124 (10th Cir. 2023); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of State \nUtil. Consumer Advocs. v. FCC, 457 F.3d 1238, 1249 \n\n22 \n(11th Cir. 2006), modified on other grounds on denial \nof reh\u2019g, 468 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); \nErie-Niagara Rail Steering Comm. v. Surface Trans. \nBd., 167 F.3d 111, 112-113 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); \nIn re: Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d \n317, 334-335 (7th Cir. 1986).  Unlike the Fifth Circuit \nin American Trucking and Wales Transportation, \nthose courts thoroughly analyzed\u2014and explained\u2014\nthe bases of their rulings, concluding (for example) \nthat the Fifth Circuit failed to acknowledge \u201cthe inter-\nvening change in governing procedure\u201d regarding re-\nview of ICC orders, and also failed to show why such a \nposition should \u201cremain valid today.\u201d  Erie-Niagara \nRail Steering Comm., 167 F.3d at 112.\nThird, there is no basis in logic, common sense, or \npolicy for the ultra vires exception, as the circum-\nstances of this very case confirm.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nview was that Texas had made three merits argu-\nments, and Fasken had made four\u2014with both sets of \npetitioners including Administrative Procedure Act \nand other claims.  Of those, and pursuant to its \u201cultra \nvires\u201d ruling, the Fifth Circuit had to pick which of the \narguments qualified as an assertion that the agency \nexceeded its authority.  The court selected Texas\u2019s \nstatutory authority claim (but not its Administrative \nProcedure Act claim) and one of Fasken\u2019s two Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act claims (i.e., one invoking the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act).  ISP App. 20a-21a.  The ar-\nbitrary and unworkable nature of that type of ad hoc\napproach is plain: any clever litigant can frame an ar-\ngument of agency error as the agency exceeding its \nlawful authority.  That characterization, as Judge \nEasterbrook has aptly observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, is merely \u201ca synonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., \n\n23 \nMilwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  \nMoreover, the Fifth Circuit articulated no rationale \nthat would limit its ultra vires doctrine to just the \nHobbs Act\u2014if left to stand, the doctrine could truly \nrepresent a sea change in courts\u2019 ability to disregard \ncarefully crafted and long-settled congressionally \nmandated review schemes.  The \u201crisk for judicial ag-\ngrandizement when courts can pick and choose when \nto abide by Congress\u2019 limits\u201d is obvious.  ISP Pet. App. \n52a (Higginson, J., dissenting). \nII.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Dicta Regarding Hobbs \nAct \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d Requirements Was \nErroneous. \nIn opposing certiorari, respondents primarily re-\nlied on arguments that the respondents were in fact \n\u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act (and the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta to that effect), rather than trying to de-\nfend the ultra vires exception pursuant to which the \nFifth Circuit actually heard the case.  (Texas Br. in \nOpp. 8-16; Fasken Br. in Opp. 24-32.)   \nContinuation of that strategy here would be una-\nvailing\u2014the Hobbs Act dicta by the Fifth Circuit is \nwrong, unsupported by the statute, and at odds with \nevery other relevant circuit precedent.  Respondents \ncan offer no good reason to upend decades of well-set-\ntled law regarding the applicable judicial review \nscheme, and this Court should not endorse the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s aberrant views regarding the Hobbs Act. \nUnder the AEA, when an applicant seeks a \nmaterials license to possess spent nuclear fuel, \u201cthe \nCommission shall grant a hearing upon the request of \nany person whose interest may be affected by the \nproceeding, and shall admit any such person as a party \n\n24 \nto such proceeding.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  The \nNRC has promulgated regulations governing such \nhearings, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 2.309(a), (d), and (f), including \nprovisions specifically contemplating participation by \nStates.  10 C.F.R. 2.309(h).  The Hobbs Act vests courts \nof appeals with exclusive jurisdiction to review a \u201cfinal \norder\u201d of the Commission \u201centered in any proceeding\u201d \n\u201cgranting, suspending, revoking, or amending\u201d a \n\u201clicense.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2342(4); 42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A) \nand (b)(1).  Jurisdiction for courts to review challenges \nto such licenses is limited to appeals by a \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d by the agency proceeding\u2014that is, a person \nwho has become a \u201cparty\u201d to the agency proceeding.  28 \nU.S.C. 2344.  (If a person is denied \u201cparty\u201d status by \nthe agency, then that determination itself is \nappealable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2239(b)(1).) \nStart with the language of the statute: the right to \njudicial review was limited by Congress to a \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not a \u201cperson\u201d aggrieved, as \nin other review statutes like the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 702.  That distinction is meaning-\nful, as then-Judge Scalia explained for the court in \nSimmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014\n\u201c[t]o give meaning to that apparently intentional vari-\nation,\u201d the term \u201cparty\u201d in the Hobbs Act must be un-\nderstood as \u201creferring to a party before the agency, not \na party to the judicial proceeding.\u201d  Simmons, 716 F.2d \nat 43.  That understanding comports with settled, \nwell-understood meanings of the term in the law.  E.g., \nParty, BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1278 (4th ed. Rev. \n1968) (\u201c\u2018Party\u2019 is a technical word, and has a precise \nmeaning in legal parlance.  By it is understood he or \nthey by or against whom a suit is brought, * * * and all \n\n25 \nothers who may be affected by the suit are * * * persons \ninterested, but not parties.\u201d). \nAnd, without exception (until now), in numerous \ndecisions over the years courts have repeatedly con-\nfirmed the proposition that those who fail to \u201cproperly \nintervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC proceeding * * * are \nnot \u2018parti[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u200a\u201d and therefore may not seek \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear-\nFree Network, 53 F.4th at 239; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l \nParks Conservation Ass\u2019n v. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049-\n1050 (9th Cir. 2021); NRDC v. NRC, 823 F.3d 641, 643 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016); Gage, 479 F.2d at 1217-1218; Balde-\nras, 59 F.4th at 1116-1119.  That consistent line of ju-\ndicial interpretation carries great weight.  Cf. Loper \nBright Enters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2278 \n(2024) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (\u201cMadison observed \nthat judicial rulings \u2018repeatedly confirmed\u2019 may supply \nbetter evidence of the law\u2019s meaning than isolated or \naberrant ones.\u201d (emphasis in original) (citing Letter \nfrom James Madison to Charles J. Ingersol (June 25, \n1831), in 4 LETTERS AND OTHER WRITINGS OF JAMES \nMADISON 184 (1867))). \nOther statutory indicia reinforce the principle.  \nSection 2348 provides that \u201cpart[ies] in interest in the \nproceeding before the agency\u201d may appear in judicial \nreview proceedings of their own motion and as of right, \nbut other entities \u201cwhose interests are affected by the \norder of the agency, may intervene.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2348.  \nThat statutory distinction between judicial review as-\nof-right on the one hand, and permissive intervention \non the other, \u201cwould be defeated\u201d if a nonparty to the \nagency proceeding \u201ccould file its own petition for \n\n26 \nreview as a matter of right.\u201d  Ala. Power Co. v. FCC, \n311 F.3d 1357, 1366 (11th Cir. 2002). \nFor a formal agency hearing implicated by a re-\nquest for a spent nuclear fuel materials license such as \nin this case, merely dashing off emails, letters, or even \na set of lengthy comments to the agency does not make \none a \u201cparty.\u201d  Just as filing an amicus brief in a court \ndoes not confer party status or entitle the amici to pur-\nsue an appeal in its own right, pursuit of an action in \ncourt is limited to \u201cparties.\u201d  E.g., FED. R. APP. P. 3-4.  \nAs Judge Easterbrook observed in another Hobbs Act \ncase, \u201c[i]f a non-party tried to appeal from a judgment \nof a district court,\u201d a court would summarily \u201cdismiss \nthe appeal.\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. R.R., \n799 F.2d at 334-335.   \nRespondents, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta, and the \nopinion in support of denial of en banc review have \npointed to cases where the mere submission of com-\nments in an agency rulemaking may be enough to con-\nfer \u201cparty\u201d status for purposes of such proceedings gov-\nerned by the Hobbs Act.  ISP App. 17a-19a, 37a-38a; \nTexas Br. in Opp. 9-10, 15.  Here, however, that anal-\nogy misses the mark.  Rulemakings (which are not at \nissue here) and adjudicatory agency proceedings \n(which are) are fundamentally different.  Who can \nfairly be said to be a \u201cparty\u201d to a notice and comment \nrulemaking, if not a person who submits comments in \naccordance with agency rules?  That conclusion simply \napplies the words of the statute to the particular \nagency procedure at issue, and courts have consist-\nently and sensibly recognized that the nature of the \nagency proceeding can dictate what is required to con-\nfer \u201cparty\u201d status.  E.g., Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, \n\n27 \n819 F.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (the \u201cdegree of \nparticipation necessary to achieve party status varies \naccording to the formality with which the proceeding \nwas conducted.\u201d).  But even in rulemakings, an inter-\nested person must comply with procedures regarding \nproper submission of comments\u2014slipping a handwrit-\nten note under the door of the agency headquarters af-\nter the deadline for comments has passed would not \nsuffice.  E.g., Ala. Power Co. v. ICC, 852 F.2d 1361, \n1368 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (denying \u201cparty\u201d status in a rule-\nmaking proceeding where petitioner\u2019s submission fell \n\u201cshort of that required in the type of ICC proceeding at \nissue here.\u201d).  The specifics of what is required to be-\ncome a \u201cparty\u201d may vary depending on the particular \nagency action at issue, but that does not mean that a \nperson who intentionally eschews available agency \nprocedures for becoming a party can nevertheless then \nclaim \u201cparty\u201d status and appeal the agency determina-\ntion to a circuit court.  See, e.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at \n1118 (\u201cThe appropriateness and availability of these \nprocedures differ when agencies enact rules and adju-\ndicate disputes.\u201d). \nContrary to the concurring opinion below, ISP Pet. \nApp. 35a, this case does not implicate any lack of avail-\nable judicial review or threaten the judiciary\u2019s role un-\nder Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803).  Neither \nrespondent was denied a day in court, nor was the \nNRC in \u201ccontrol [of] the courthouse door.\u201d  ISP Pet. \nApp. 34a.  Just the opposite\u2014Fasken actually had its \nday in court in the D.C. Circuit on the issues properly \nraised at the agency level, but it did not prevail.  Don\u2019t \nWaste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  With regard to \nTexas, the NRC regulations explicitly provide for po-\ntential participation by States, 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h), and \n\n28 \nStates routinely challenge NRC licensing actions at \nboth the agency level and in courts pursuant to the \nHobbs Act.  E.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 \nF.3d 132, 135 (3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey); Palisades \nNuclear Plant & Big Rock Point, CLI-22-08, 2022 WL \n18355239, at *10 n.76 (N.R.C. July 15, 2022) (Michi-\ngan); In re Entergy Nuclear Vt. Yankee, CLI-16-12, \n2016 WL 3476306, at *2 n.28 (N.R.C. June 23, 2016) \n(Vermont).  Here, Texas was for the license, and then \nagainst it, but for whatever reason did not take the \nsteps that were fully available to it for participation at \nthe agency level, which would have opened the \u201ccourt-\nhouse door.\u201d  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from long-\nsettled law in this case was not necessary to ensure \navailability of meaningful judicial review. \nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act and justicia-\nbility, the severe negative repercussions of the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s ruling in this case should be considered.  If \nany person can sue in court at any time to block or va-\ncate an NRC-issued license without even trying to par-\nticipate before the agency, why continue to have exten-\nsive safety-based adjudicatory hearings at the agency \nlevel at all?  For decades, the NRC has relied upon \nsuch adjudicatory proceedings to protect the health \nand safety of the public.  ISP spent many years and \nmillions of dollars to secure its license in this case.  \nThat was all rendered for naught, however, with the \nbelated stroke of a pen by the Fifth Circuit.  If that is \nthe new normal, rational business entities are unlikely \nto take on that type of risk, expense, and uncertainty \nfor future nuclear projects.  The impacts for a crucial, \ncapital-intensive industry, at a critical time of new \ntechnologies and opportunities, would be potentially \ncatastrophic.  As the dissent to denial of en banc review \n\n29 \ncorrectly recognized, the \u201cgrave consequences\u201d of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision here for an industry that is a \nsubstantial source of the nation\u2019s power, and most of \nits actual and potential non-carbon-based generation \nof electricity, can hardly be overstated.  ISP Pet. App. \n46a. \nIII.\nThe Atomic Energy Act Permits the NRC to \nLicense Private Parties to Temporarily \nPossess Spent Nuclear Fuel Away from the \nNuclear Reactor That Generated the Spent \nNuclear Fuel. \nA.\nLicenses for Temporary Away-From-\nReactor Possession of Spent Nuclear \nFuel Fall Within the NRC\u2019s Expressly \nDelegated Authority. \nThe authority of the NRC to license private parties \nto temporarily store spent nuclear fuel away from the \nreactor that generated the fuel is comfortably estab-\nlished by the terms of the AEA itself, and confirmed by \nthe relevant history, context, and consistent judicial \nrulings to that effect. \nSpent nuclear fuel is composed of special nuclear \nmaterial, source material, and byproduct material.  \nISP Pet. App. 22a; see, e.g., Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538.  \nFrom that undisputed factual premise, the legal con-\nclusion readily follows.  Again, start with the words of \nthe statute: Section 161(b) of the AEA, 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), tasks the NRC with the responsibility to \u201ces-\ntablish by rule, regulation, or order\u201d the \u201cstandards \nand instructions to govern the possession and use\u201d of \nall of the constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \nthat the NRC deems \u201cnecessary or desirable to pro-\nmote the common defense and security or to protect \n\n30 \nhealth or to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d  Con-\ngress confirmed that \u201ccommon defense and security\u201d \nincludes \u201cdevelopment, utilization, and control of \natomic energy for military and all other purposes,\u201d and \nalso confirmed that the \u201cprocessing and utilization\u201d of \nthe constituent elements of spent nuclear fuel \u201cmust \nbe regulated\u201d by the NRC \u201cin the national interest,\u201d to \n\u201cprotect the health and safety of the public.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n2011(a); 2012(c), (d).  With the development of a do-\nmestic nuclear power industry and the consequent po-\ntential need to store spent nuclear fuel away from op-\nerating reactors, it plainly fell within the NRC\u2019s man-\ndate\u2014indeed, it was the agency\u2019s duty\u2014to regulate \nsuch possession and use to safeguard the public health \nand safety. \nAdditional statutory provisions regarding the pos-\nsession and use of each of the three constituent ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel point to the same conclu-\nsion.  For special nuclear material, the NRC is author-\nized to issue licenses for possession for research and \ndevelopment regarding atomic energy (42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(1)), for research and development regarding \nmedical uses (42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(2)), for use in utiliza-\ntion facilities (i.e., power plants) or production facili-\nties (i.e., certain isotope production plants) (42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(3)), and\u2014significantly and separately\u2014for \n\u201csuch other uses as the Commission determines to be \nappropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) (emphasis supplied).   \nSimilarly, for source material, the NRC is author-\nized to issue licenses for possession for research and \ndevelopment regarding atomic energy (42 U.S.C. \n2093(a)(1)), for research and development regarding \n\n31 \nmedical uses (42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(2)), for use in utiliza-\ntion facilities (i.e., power plants) or production facili-\nties (i.e., certain isotope production plants) (42 U.S.C. \n2093(a)(3)), and\u2014significantly and separately\u2014for \n\u201cfor any other use approved by the Commission as an \naid to science or industry.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(4) (em-\nphasis supplied).  \nFor byproduct material, the Commission was au-\nthorized to issue licenses for use in research and devel-\nopment, medical therapy, and agricultural uses, but \nalso \u201cindustrial uses,\u201d and \u201csuch other useful applica-\ntions as may be developed.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2111(a) (empha-\nsis supplied). \nNowhere in this statutory scheme does Congress \nplace artificial limits on the NRC\u2019s ability to license \npossession or use of these materials.  On the contrary, \nCongress made clear that the \u201cpurposes of this chap-\nter\u201d and the \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201cindustrial uses\u201d that the \nNRC was charged with considering for regulation of \nspecial nuclear, source, and byproduct material \nbroadly encompassed the \u201cdevelopment, use, and con-\ntrol of atomic energy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a).  Congress \nfurther decreed that the agency should endeavor to \n\u201cstrengthen free competition in private enterprise\u201d in \npursuing its regulatory mission.  42 U.S.C. 2011(b).  \nThe project to be licensed by the NRC in this case\u2014a \nprivate, away-from-reactor installation to facilitate \nthe use of atomic energy by temporarily storing the re-\nsulting used nuclear fuel\u2014falls within the bull\u2019s eye of \nthe industrial purposes that the AEA was enacted to \naddress and that the NRC was charged to regulate. \nIn short, the best reading of these provisions\u2014in-\ndeed, the only plausible reading\u2014is that the NRC is \n\n32 \nacting well within the authority delegated to it by Con-\ngress in the AEA when the NRC regulates the tempo-\nrary storage of spent nuclear fuel by a private party.  \nEach of the delegations just discussed is a classic ex-\nample of Congress empowering the NRC \u201cto regulate \nsubject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that \n\u2018leaves [the agency] with flexibility.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Loper Bright En-\nters. v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2263 & n.6 (2024) \n(citation omitted).  Nothing in the AEA limits the \nNRC\u2019s authority over such temporary storage to the \nphysical site of an operating, or formerly operating, re-\nactor. \nConsistent with its statutory mandate, when the \nNRC determined to formalize its procedures regarding \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel in \n1978, it did so in the most public, deliberate, and trans-\nparent way possible\u2014with extensive notice and com-\nment rulemaking, explicitly citing the above-noted \nAEA statutory provisions as its authority for doing so.  \nThe public record and comments covered almost every \nconceivable issue, including policy debates regarding \n\u201cat-reactor versus away-from-reactor siting\u201d of storage \ninstallations (45 Fed. Reg. at 74,696 (cleaned up)), but \nthere was no suggestion regarding any lack of NRC au-\nthority over the latter under the AEA.  Those regula-\ntions were promulgated in 1980, and have been on the \nbooks at 10 C.F.R. Part 72 and applied as needed, both \nprior to the passage of the NWPA in 1982 and for the \nmore than four decades since.  There are at least a \ndozen existing sites in the country where there is no \noperating reactor and where spent nuclear fuel is \nstored, at least seven of which are privately owned and \nlicensed pursuant to the same statutory and regula-\ntory authority as the proposed project in this case.  See \n\n33 \nU.S. Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations \n(ISFSI), NRC (June 2023), https://www.nrc.gov/docs/\nML2316/ML23165A245.pdf (Current U.S. Independ-\nent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Map as of \nJune 12, 2023 (nrc.gov)). \nThe D.C. and Tenth Circuits have consistently af-\nfirmed this reading of the AEA.  In the Bullcreek pro-\nceedings, both at the agency level and before the court \nof appeals, the vigorously contested issues were all \nabout whether the NRC\u2019s existing authority under the \nAEA to license away-from-reactor storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel had been abrogated by the NWPA.  See In re \nPriv. Fuel Storage, L.L.C., CLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, \n395-396 (Dec. 18, 2002); Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 539-\n540; see also Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at 1232.  If there \nwas any legitimate doubt about the existence of the \nNRC\u2019s preexisting authority under the AEA in the first \nplace, such doubts would have been aired in those pro-\nceedings, rather than conceded.  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at \n541.   \nIn Bullcreek, the D.C. Circuit did not say it was \n\u201cassuming without deciding\u201d the AEA\u2019s scope, which \nwould have been easy enough to do if that was truly \nwhat was going on.  That, however, was not what was \ngoing on\u2014the underlying AEA authority for the NRC \nwas the necessary predicate to the whole case.  More-\nover, any doubts that might have existed about the \ndepth or pedigree of the Bullcreek court\u2019s holdings re-\ngarding AEA authority were dispelled by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s recent decision in Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, \n113 F.4th 956 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  In Beyond Nuclear, \nwhich involved a private away-from-reactor spent fuel \nstorage project similar to the one in this case, the D.C. \n\n34 \nCircuit reaffirmed its rulings in unmistakable terms: \n\u201cIn Bullcreek, we explicitly held that the AEA provided \nthe \u2018NRC authority to license and regulate the storage \nand disposal of spent nuclear fuel,\u2019 and \u2018[p]ursuant to \nits AEA authority, the NRC promulgated regulations \n* * * for licensing onsite and away-from-reactor spent \nnuclear fuel storage facilities for private nuclear gen-\nerators.\u2019\u201d  Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at 965 (quoting \nBullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538).  The court further held \nthat the NRC had \u201ceasily rejected\u201d the exact same AEA \nargument made by the respondents here, upon the au-\nthority of Bullcreek.  Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at 965.   \nThe statutory text, the decades-old regulations, \nand the case law are all consistent: the AEA permits \nthe NRC to license private parties to temporarily store \nspent nuclear fuel away from the nuclear reactor that \ngenerated the fuel. \nB.\nThe Fifth Circuit and the Respond-\nents Misread the AEA. \nThat has been the settled law for decades, until the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  None of the argu-\nments offered by the Fifth Circuit, or by respondents, \nwarrant a departure. \n1. \nWhile the Fifth Circuit did not come right out \nand say it, the court\u2019s main interpretative approach \nwas to apply a distorted type of ejusdem generis or \nnoscitur a sociis reasoning to the AEA\u2019s delegations of \nauthority.  That is, the Fifth Circuit looked at the \u201cre-\nsearch and development\u201d provisions of 42 U.S.C. \n2073(a)(1) and (2) for special nuclear material, and of \n42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(1) and (2) for source material, and \ninferred that possession licenses for those materials \n\n35 \nmay only be issued by the NRC for \u201ccertain types of \nresearch and development.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 22a. \nThat conclusion is wrong for many reasons.  First, \neven if it were proper to apply an ejusdem generis-type \ncanon of interpretation here (and it was not, as ex-\nplained below), the Fifth Circuit inexplicably failed to \nconsider 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(3) and 2093(a)(3), which \nauthorize \u201cfacilities\u201d licenses for power and isotope \nproduction plants and have nothing to do with \u201cre-\nsearch and development.\u201d  One cannot just ignore por-\ntions of the surrounding statute that do not fit the de-\nsired result.   \nSecond, application of ejusdem generis, as this \nCourt recently held, requires a \u201clong and detailed list \nof specific directions,\u201d with a common \u201clink.\u201d  Harring-\nton v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, 2082 \n(2024), neither of which are present here.  There is no \n\u201clong list,\u201d but, rather, just four distinct enumerations \nof possible licensing purposes, with the last one being \nan express assignment of broad responsibility to the \nagency.  Indeed, and tellingly, in opposing certiorari, \nFasken rejected the \u201cresearch and development\u201d com-\nmonality proffered by the Fifth Circuit, in favor of a \nnewly minted \u201cactive, productive use\u201d construct, which \nwas never argued below nor embraced by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  Fasken Br. in Opp. 14.  Such disagreements \nabout the required commonality among those asserting \nand trying to defend the result are proof positive that \nthere is no true \u201ccommon attribute,\u201d and that the \nejusdem generis canon therefore does not apply.  E.g., \nAli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 225 (2008); \nSw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, 462 (2022). \n\n36 \nThird, the Fifth Circuit read critically important \nsections of the statutes, i.e., 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4) and \n2093(a)(4), as meaningless, i.e., as adding nothing to \nthe \u201cresearch and development\u201d provisions.  Subsec-\ntions (a)(4) of the statutes are not mere catchall provi-\nsions, but, rather, significant terms that expressly en-\nsure that the agency can fully implement the congres-\nsionally defined purposes of the AEA.  Doctrines such \nas noscitur a sociis may not be applied to give a statu-\ntory term \u201cthe same function as other words in the def-\ninition, thereby denying it independent meaning.\u201d \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  And, courts \nshould refrain from \u201cinterpreting any statutory provi-\nsion in a manner that would render another provision \nsuperfluous.\u201d  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 596, 607-\n608 (2010), (citing Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. \n303, 314 (2009)).  The Fifth Circuit violated those ele-\nmental principles, and its decision should be reversed. \n2.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s only treatment of Sections \n2073(a)(3) and 2093(a)(3) was to set up, and then re-\nject, a strawman.  Those sections refer to 42 U.S.C. \n2133, which authorize so-called \u201cfacilities\u201d licenses for \n\u201cutilization facilities,\u201d which are power plants (42 \nU.S.C. 2014(cc)), and \u201cproduction facilities,\u201d which are \nisotope production facilities (42 U.S.C. 2014(v)).  Be-\ncause those are defined terms that the Fifth Circuit \nviewed as not encompassing \u201cstorage or disposal,\u201d the \nFifth Circuit held that they do not authorize the pro-\nject at issue.  ISP App. 23a.  But no one ever argued \nthat they did.  The argument, instead, was that other \naspects of the agency\u2019s delegated powers furnish the \nnecessary authority.  And if the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading \nwere correct, a seemingly necessary implication would \n\n37 \nbe that the AEA does not authorize the NRC to license \n\u201cstorage\u201d of spent nuclear fuel\u2014by anyone, anywhere, \never.  In opposing certiorari, Texas ran with that view, \nTexas Br. in Opp. 22, but then, perhaps recognizing \nthat that simply could not be correct, postulated that \n\u201ccommon sense\u201d (as opposed to anything in the stat-\nute) must mean that nuclear utilities are allowed to \nstore fuel at the site of an operating reactor.  Texas Br. \nin Opp. 30.  The contortions one must make to defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s outcome reveals its error. \n3.  Another strawman invoked by the Fifth Cir-\ncuit involved 42 U.S.C. 2011, which relates to byprod-\nuct materials.  The Fifth Circuit focused on 42 U.S.C. \n2111(b), which addresses \u201cdisposal\u201d of certain types of \n\u201cbyproduct\u201d materials.  ISP Pet. App. 23a.  The license \nat issue here, however, has nothing to do with \u201cdis-\nposal,\u201d but instead involves temporary \u201cpossession\u201d of \nspent nuclear fuel until it is permanently disposed of.  \nThe relevant \u201cbyproduct\u201d provision is therefore Section \n2111(a)\u2014not Section 2111(b), which no one ever in-\nvoked to authorize the license at issue.  The Fifth Cir-\ncuit then did its own web-based research about half-\nlives of certain radioactive isotopes, opining that the \nhalf-life of radium-226 is far less than that of pluto-\nnium, and, since spent nuclear fuel contains pluto-\nnium, Section 2111(b) could not apply or authorize the \nlicense.  ISP Pet. App. 23-24a.  But, again, no one ever \nargued that it did, and plutonium is not even \u201cbyprod-\nuct\u201d material.  Rather, it is \u201cspecial nuclear material.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 2014(aa).  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s reliance on \nSection 2111(b) for its conclusions is therefore doubly \nmisguided.   \n\n38 \n4.  At bottom, the Fifth Circuit and the respond-\nents impermissibly seek to insert a substantive mate-\nrial term that they may now wish was in the AEA, but \nwhich is not\u2014namely, a geographic \u201cat-reactor\u201d limi-\ntation on possession and storage of spent nuclear fuel.  \nCourts, however, may not rewrite statutes to insert \nterms that are not there.  E.g., Borden v. United States, \n593 U.S. 420, 436 (2021) (\u201cOnce again, statutory con-\nstruction does not work that way:  A court does not get \nto delete inconvenient language and insert convenient \nlanguage to yield the court\u2019s preferred meaning.\u201d); Ro-\nmag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil, Inc., 590 U.S. 212, 215 \n(2020) (\u201cNor does this Court usually read into statutes \nwords that aren\u2019t there.\u201d).   \n5.  The last important point about the AEA con-\ncerns the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reliance on West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  ISP Pet. App. 30-31a; see \nalso Fasken Br. in Opp. 15-17; Texas Br. in Opp. 32.  \nWhatever the post-Loper Bright import of West Vir-\nginia might be, the \u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine has no \nbearing here.  In all the ways that matter, this case \npresents circumstances that are the complete opposite\nof those that led this Court to give heightened scrutiny \nto agency action in West Virginia.  This is not a case \nwhere an agency strayed outside its lane\u2014safety-\nbased regulation of nuclear materials, which has al-\nways been the agency\u2019s core function under the AEA, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(b), 2201(b).  The license and appli-\ncable regulations here plainly serve just that purpose.  \nHere, there was nothing \u201cunprecedented\u201d nor any way \nthat \u201cthings changed\u201d when the NRC exercised its dec-\nades-old, completely transparent licensing authority \nfor these materials.  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 711.  \nCongress had not \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d the \n\n39 \nexercise of that challenged authority.  Id. at 731.  And \nit is emphatically not true that the NRC has \u201cnever \nregulated\u201d in the way now being challenged.  Id. at \n729-731.  The NRC should be allowed to keep doing \nwhat it has lawfully been doing under the AEA for \nnearly half a century, and West Virginia is not at all to \nthe contrary. \nIV.\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not \nProhibit the NRC from Licensing Private \nParties to Temporarily Store Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel Away from the Nuclear Reactor \nThat Generated the Spent Nuclear Fuel.  \nIn holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d private \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel, the \nFifth Circuit abandoned any pretense of relying on \nstatutory text.  ISP Pet. App. 30a.  Rather, the court \ninvoked characterizations of alleged \u201cCongressional \npolicy,\u201d \u201chistorical context,\u201d and the overall \u201cstatutory \nscheme.\u201d  ISP Pet. App. 21a, 29a, 30a.  It had no other \nchoice: the NWPA contains no text whatsoever that ex-\npressly or impliedly prohibits the NRC from licensing \na private party to possess spent nuclear fuel at an \naway-from-reactor site.  In all the briefing in these \nmatters to date, neither respondents nor the Fifth Cir-\ncuit ever identified any such term, because one does \nnot exist. \nThe Fifth Circuit also misconstrued the structure \nand text of the portions of the NWPA that it did cite.  \nFor example, the Fifth Circuit erroneously invoked a \npart of the NWPA that describes at-reactor storage at \nPart B-Interim Storage Program, 42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157, as a purported limitation on the NRC (ISP App. \n28a-29a), without appreciating that the actual role of \n\n40 \nthose provisions was merely to delineate \u201cprecondi-\ntions on private generators for obtaining federal in-\nterim storage.\u201d Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  Similarly, \nthe \u201cmonitored retrievable storage\u201d provisions at 42 \nU.S.C. 10161-10169, by their terms, relate to storage \nof spent nuclear fuel by DOE, not by private parties.  \n(Neither of those programs ultimately came to pass, \nbut the statutory provisions did nothing to call into \nquestion the NRC\u2019s pre-existing authority under the \nAEA.)  Section 10155(h), which the Fifth Circuit cited \nin a footnote (ISP Pet. App. 28a n.4), states that \u201cnoth-\ning in this chapter shall be construed to encourage, au-\nthorize, or require the private or Federal use, pur-\nchase, lease, or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian nuclear \npower reactor and not owned by the Federal Govern-\nment on\u201d the date of enactment.  That provision, how-\never, merely limits the scope of the NWPA\u2014it \u201cis fa-\ncially neutral: neither prohibiting nor promoting the \nuse of private [away-from-reactor] storage facilities.\u201d  \nBullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542 (cleaned up).  Properly con-\nstrued, \u201cnothing in the text of \u00a7 10155(h) suggests that \nCongress intended to repeal\u201d the NRC\u2019s authority to \nlicense private away-from-reactor storage under the \nAEA.  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542. \nThe context of the NWPA\u2019s enactment confirms \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s error.  The regulations at 10 C.F.R. \nPart 72 had long been on the books when the NWPA \nwas being debated and enacted, and the NRC\u2019s asser-\ntion of authority to license private away-from-reactor \nstorage under the AEA was well known to Congress.  \nSee S. REP. NO. 97-282, at 44 (1981); Bullcreek, 359 \nF.3d at 542 (\u201cCongress was aware of the NRC\u2019s regu-\nlations for licensing private away-from-reactor storage \n\n41 \nfacilities\u201d).  Congress, of course, \u201clegislates against the \nbackdrop of existing law,\u201d Parker Drilling Mgmt. \nServs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (cita-\ntion omitted).  And here, that existing law included the \nAEA delegations discussed above, which the NRC \nopenly construed as permitting the type of licensing \nbeing challenged here.  It is a \u201ccardinal rule\u201d that a \nrevocation of the NRC\u2019s preexisting statutory author-\nity should not be implied from a subsequent law.  Mor-\nton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 549-551 (1974).  Had \nCongress wanted to limit this licensing authority, it \nwould have done so explicitly. \nAnd, once again, the case law of other circuits is \nconsistent, persuasive, and directly contrary to the \nNWPA holding of the Fifth Circuit here.  The NWPA \narguments by the petitioners in Bullcreek and the re-\nspondents in this case (adopted by the Fifth Circuit) \nare almost verbatim:  Compare Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at \n539 (\u201cCongress had established in the NWPA a \u2018com-\nprehensive national nuclear waste management sys-\ntem for the storage of [spent nuclear fuel],\u2019\u201d that pro-\nhibited the NRC from licensing private away-from-re-\nactor storage of spent nuclear fuel (quoting petition)) \nwith ISP Pet. App. 29a (\u201ccomprehensive statutory \nscheme\u201d of the NWPA precludes the NRC from licens-\ning away-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel).  \nIn response, and unlike the Fifth Circuit here, the \nBullcreek \ncourt \nthoroughly\u2014and \naccurately\u2014re-\nviewed the \u201clanguage,\u201d \u201cstructure,\u201d and \u201clegislative \nhistory\u201d of the NWPA, and rejected the claims.  Bull-\ncreek, 359 F.3d at 541-542.  Every other circuit court \nthat has addressed the issue has reached the same re-\nsult.  Skull Valley, 376 F.3d at 1232-1233; Balderas, \n\n42 \n59 F.4th at 1115, 1121; Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th at \n965. \nIn sum: the NWPA created acceptance and dis-\nposal obligations on the part of DOE, not the NRC.  \nThe NWPA was all about permanent disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel by DOE, not temporary possession of spent \nnuclear fuel by private parties.  E.g., Don\u2019t Waste \nMich., 2023 WL 395030, at *1 (\u201cStorage and disposal, \nhowever, are different concepts.\u201d); Balderas, 59 F.4th \nat 1115, 1121 (NWPA \u201cgoverns the establishment of a \nfederal repository for permanent storage [i.e., dis-\nposal], not temporary storage by private parties.\u201d).  As \nthe other circuits have held, at the end of the day the \nNWPA has nothing to do with the issues in this case.  \nThe Fifth Circuit erred in splitting with those circuits \nand concluding otherwise. \n\n43 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be re-\nversed, and this Court should direct the Fifth Circuit \nto dismiss or deny the petitions. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBRAD FAGG\n Counsel of Record \nTIMOTHY P.

My initial analysis has now provided a foundational structure for understanding the dispute. The case presents two distinct legal questions that the Supreme Court must resolve:\n\n1.  **A procedural question of standing:** The Court will decide whether a nonparty is permitted to challenge a federal agency's \"final order\" under the Hobbs Act's judicial review provision. This is a threshold issue that could resolve the case without reaching the merits.\n2.  **A substantive question of statutory authority:** The Court will determine if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is empowered by federal law\u2014specifically the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act\u2014to issue licenses for private companies to store spent nuclear fuel at sites away from nuclear reactors.\n\nThis initial framing clarifies that my prediction must account for two separate lines of legal reasoning. The petitioner, the NRC, will be arguing to affirm both the challenger's standing and its own licensing authority, seeking to overturn the Fifth Circuit's decision.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be structured around two central legal questions: a procedural one of standing and a substantive one of statutory authority. The initial observation provided this basic framework. The petitioners, the NRC and now clarified to include Interim Storage Partners, LLC (ISP), seek to overturn the Fifth Circuit's decision on both fronts.\n\nThe brief from petitioner ISP has significantly deepened my knowledge of the specific legal arguments and the broader judicial context.\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):**\n    *   **Core Argument:** My understanding is now more precise. The petitioners argue that the Hobbs Act's judicial review provision (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344) is jurisdictional and explicitly limits the right to sue to a \"party aggrieved\" by an agency's final order. They contend that Texas and the other respondents do not qualify because they deliberately chose not to participate in the NRC's administrative proceedings, thus failing to become \"parties.\"\n    *   **The \"Ultra Vires\" Exception:** The petitioners are directly attacking the Fifth Circuit's justification for hearing the case: a \"judge-made 'ultra vires exception.'\" Their argument is that a court cannot create an exception to a clear statutory jurisdictional requirement simply because a plaintiff alleges the agency acted beyond its legal authority. This frames the issue as one of judicial restraint and strict adherence to statutory text, a theme that may resonate with the current Court.\n    *   **Circuit Split Context:** The brief reveals a critical signal: a circuit split. The Tenth Circuit, in *State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC*, dismissed a similar challenge on these procedural grounds. This positions the Fifth Circuit as an outlier, a factor that heavily influences the Supreme Court's decision to grant certiorari and often predicts reversal.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):**\n    *   **Atomic Energy Act (AEA) as a Source of Authority:** The petitioners' argument is that the AEA provides a broad and sufficient grant of authority. They contend the NRC's power to license the \"possession and use\" of nuclear materials (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(b)) is the foundation for its actions. They argue this is not a novel interpretation but is rooted in decades of agency practice, citing regulations for independent spent fuel storage installations (10 C.F.R. pt. 72) that have existed since 1980. This \"historical gloss\" argument suggests the Fifth Circuit ignored long-settled administrative and industry practice.\n    *   **Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) as a Non-Prohibition:** Petitioners frame the NWPA not as a source of authority, but as a statute that the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted as a *limitation* on the AEA. Their argument is that the NWPA, by creating a framework for a *permanent federal repository*, did not implicitly repeal the NRC's pre-existing authority under the AEA to license *temporary private storage*. The failure of the federal government to create the permanent repository (Yucca Mountain) is presented as the practical justification for why such private solutions are necessary and consistent with the overall statutory scheme.\n    *   **Judicial Precedent:** The brief highlights that the D.C. Circuit, in *Don\u2019t Waste Michigan v. NRC*, affirmed the very same license against other challenges, and that other circuits (*Bullcreek v. NRC*, *Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson*) have previously upheld the NRC's authority in this area. This reinforces the narrative that the Fifth Circuit's decision is an anomaly that disrupts a stable legal and regulatory consensus.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved from a basic structural understanding to a much richer one. I now see the petitioners' case as resting on three pillars: (1) a textual, jurisdictional argument on standing under the Hobbs Act; (2) a substantive argument based on the AEA's broad grant of authority and decades of consistent agency practice; and (3) the assertion that the Fifth Circuit's decision creates a circuit split, disrupting a long-standing consensus among other courts of appeals. My confidence in a potential prediction favoring the petitioners has increased, as their arguments appear to align with common interpretive methodologies favored by the Supreme Court and are bolstered by the favorable decisions from other circuits.",

This action, searching for the respondent's brief, is the single most critical step to rectify this information imbalance. \n\nTask EIG is maximal (1.0) because the respondent's brief will introduce the core counterarguments on both the procedural (Hobbs Act) and substantive (AEA/NWPA) questions. It will directly challenge the petitioner's narrative of textualism, historical practice, and judicial consensus. Understanding Texas's legal theory is not just helpful; it is essential for making any credible prediction. This information will cause the largest possible update to my task beliefs (\u03b8).\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.6) because this action validates and calibrates a fundamental principle of SCOTUS prediction strategy: after understanding the petitioner's case, one must immediately seek out the respondent's. The massive expected information gain from this step provides a crucial data point for weighting the importance of primary briefs in the general information-gathering model (D). While not a novel strategy, confirming its high value is vital for refining the overall design.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as the action is both indispensable for the immediate task and highly instructive for the general strategic model.",

For various reasons\u2014mostly politi-\ncal, some practical\u2014construction of that facility has \nstalled and now is all but \u201cdead.\u201d Nico Portuondo, The \nReturn of Yucca Mountain? GOP Floats Waste Site\u2019s \nRevival, \nE&E \nNEWS \n(Apr. \n11, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/ZS52-ZC4K. \u201cBy law,\u201d however, \u201cYucca \nMountain is still the government\u2019s official plan to deal \nwith the more than 85,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel that has piled up at more than 100 locations across \nthe country.\u201d Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a710172(a)(1).  \nAfter ignoring its statutory duties for decades, in re-\ncent years, the federal government has begun focusing \non what it claims is a policy workaround: so-called \u201cin-\nterim storage projects.\u201d Portuondo, supra. Rather than \nplacing spent fuel in a facility dedicated to permanent \n(and safe) disposal, private facilities away from reactors \nwill store waste on a nominally temporary basis. Con-\ngress, however, has never authorized such a scheme. In \nany event, how can storage be temporary if there is little \nprospect of \u201can eventual permanent repository\u201d? Id. \nHere, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission purports \nto allow a private entity to store thousands of tons of \nspent nuclear fuel above Texas\u2019s Permian Basin\u2014the \nworld\u2019s most productive oil field and the only source of \nsafe water for hundreds of miles. Although the Commis-\nsion describes this scheme as an \u201cinterim\u201d measure, the \nlicense has a forty-year term, is renewable, and is unac-\ncompanied by any plan to transfer the waste to a nonex-\ni\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The questions presented are: \n \n1. Whether the State whose very land, water, and air \nstand to be polluted by spent nuclear fuel may challenge \na license\u2014issued over its objection\u2014to store that fuel ei-\nther as a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under, or in accord with an \nultra vires exception to, the Administrative Orders Re-\nview Act, commonly called the Hobbs Act. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72344. \n \n2. Whether the Atomic Energy Act and the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, which never mention temporary \naway-from-reactor storage of spent nuclear fuel by pri-\nvate parties, nonetheless authorize the Commission to li-\ncense such a facility, notwithstanding Congress\u2019s ex-\npress command that the nation\u2019s spent fuel should be \npermanently disposed of in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \n \nQuestions Presented .........................................................

GOP Floats Waste Site\u2019s \nRevival, \nE&E \nNEWS \n(Apr. \n11, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/ZS52-ZC4K. \u201cBy law,\u201d however, \u201cYucca \nMountain is still the government\u2019s official plan to deal \nwith the more than 85,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel that has piled up at more than 100 locations across \nthe country.\u201d Id.; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a710172(a)(1).  \nAfter ignoring its statutory duties for decades, in re-\ncent years, the federal government has begun focusing \non what it claims is a policy workaround: so-called \u201cin-\nterim storage projects.\u201d Portuondo, supra. Rather than \nplacing spent fuel in a facility dedicated to permanent \n(and safe) disposal, private facilities away from reactors \nwill store waste on a nominally temporary basis. Con-\ngress, however, has never authorized such a scheme. In \nany event, how can storage be temporary if there is little \nprospect of \u201can eventual permanent repository\u201d? Id. \nHere, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission purports \nto allow a private entity to store thousands of tons of \nspent nuclear fuel above Texas\u2019s Permian Basin\u2014the \nworld\u2019s most productive oil field and the only source of \nsafe water for hundreds of miles. Although the Commis-\nsion describes this scheme as an \u201cinterim\u201d measure, the \nlicense has a forty-year term, is renewable, and is unac-\ncompanied by any plan to transfer the waste to a nonex-\nistent permanent repository. \n\n2 \n \nNothing about this license is lawful. Congress has al-\nready legislated a solution to the nation\u2019s nuclear-waste \nproblem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No \nstatute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim \noffsite storage. Instead, the only interim storage Con-\ngress has permitted is in federal facilities, and only un-\nder defined circumstances. Because the Commission has \ncreated its own plan \u201cwithout any legal basis,\u201d In re Ai-\nken County, 725 F.3d 255, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2013), its actions \ncannot stand.  \nNonetheless, the Commission and its licensee con-\ntend that Texas and local landowners may not challenge \nthis unlawfulness, even arguing that an agency\u2019s rules \ncan limit a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. This position con-\ntravenes statutory language and creates a morass of line-\ndrawing problems. Regardless, \u201c[n]onstatutory review \nof federal agency action is available\u201d where, as here, \u201can \nagency action is ultra vires.\u201d Jared P. Cole, An Intro-\nduction to Judicial Review of Federal Agency Action at \n3 n.33, CONG\u2019L RSCH. SERV. (Dec. 7, 2016).   \nSTATEMENT \nI. Statutory and Regulatory Background \nA. Enacted in 1954, the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) \ngranted authority over certain aspects of nuclear power. \nCongress has since redistributed that authority to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of \nEnergy. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72011 et seq.; see id. \u00a75842. The Com-\nmission has \u201cjurisdiction over nuclear plant licensing and \nregulation,\u201d while the Department is primarily charged \nwith \u201cenergy research and development.\u201d County of \nRockland v. NRC, 709 F.2d 766, 769 n.2 (2d Cir. 1983). \nAs the nuclear-energy market boomed following the \nAEA\u2019s enactment, nuclear waste from spent nuclear fuel \npiled up. \u201cPrior to the late 1970\u2019s,\u201d however, that was \n\n3 \n \nunconcerning. Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 298-99 (9th \nCir. 1991). Because \u201cit was accepted that spent fuel \nwould be reprocessed,\u201d id., power plants built capacity \nonsite to store spent fuel briefly before reprocessing. \nBut in the \u201cmid-70\u2019s,\u201d the reprocessing concept \u201ccol-\nlapsed.\u201d Idaho, 945 F.2d at 298-99. The nation thus had \nnowhere to place a growing stockpile of material that re-\nmains radioactive \u201cfor time spans seemingly beyond hu-\nman comprehension.\u201d New York v. NRC, 681 F.3d 471, \n474 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Although acknowledging that onsite \nstorage facilities could be expanded with \u201cnegligible\u201d en-\nvironmental impacts, NRC, NUREG-0404, Generic En-\nvironmental Impact Statement on Handling and Stor-\nage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel at ES-5 \n(Mar. 1978), the Commission proposed \u201cinstallations \nbuilt specifically\u201d for long-term storage \u201cthat are not \ncoupled to either a nuclear power plant or a fuel repro-\ncessing plant,\u201d NRC, Proposed Rule, Storage of Spent \nFuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Storage Installa-\ntion, 43 Fed. Reg. 46,309, 46,309 (Oct. 6, 1978). \nDespite a lack of legal authority, the Commission \nplowed ahead. See, e.g., NRC, Final Rule, Licensing Re-\nquirements for the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Inde-\npendent Spent Fuel Storage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. \n74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980). This development prompted \nalarm. Some commenters warned of the significant \n\u201ctransportation risks\u201d associated with moving nuclear \nwaste. Id. at 74,696. Others \u201cexpressed a concern that \nthe promulgation of a rule covering\u201d this issue \u201cwould \ndecrease pressures on both industry and government to \nsolve the radioactive waste problem.\u201d Id. at 74,693.  \nB. In 1982, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act (NWPA) to resolve this \u201cnational problem\u201d \nand \u201cmajor subject[] of public concern\u201d for which \n\n4 \n \n\u201c[f]ederal efforts\u201d had thus far \u201cnot been adequate.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2)-(3), (7). Finding that \u201cState and \npublic participation in the planning and development of \nrepositories is essential in order to promote public confi-\ndence,\u201d id. \u00a710131(a)(6), the NWPA tasked the Depart-\nment with establishing a permanent repository to place \nthe nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel deep underground, id. \n\u00a710132. And it made the Commission responsible for li-\ncensing that repository. Id. \u00a710134. In 1987, Congress \namended the NWPA to specify Yucca Mountain, id. \n\u00a710172(a), as the site for the first repository, id. \u00a710134, \nwhich was to begin operations no later than January 31, \n1998, id. \u00a710222(a)(5)(B). \nThe NWPA also directed how spent fuel should be \nstored in the interim. Specifically, should onsite storage \nprove inadequate, Congress permitted storage of spent \nfuel (1) temporarily at a federal facility to avoid a com-\nmercial reactor\u2019s shutdown, id. \u00a7\u00a710151-57; or (2) tempo-\nrarily at a federal facility for so-called \u201cmonitored re-\ntrievable storage,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a710161-69.  \nC. Although the NWPA \u201cis obviously designed to \nprevent the Department from delaying the construction \nof Yucca Mountain as the permanent facility while using \ntemporary facilities,\u201d NARUC v. DOE, 736 F.3d 517, 519 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013), delay ensued. \u201c[B]y the mid-1990s, the \nDepartment of Energy made clear that it could not meet \nthe 1998 deadline\u201d; it did not submit a license application \nfor Yucca Mountain until 2008, Texas v. United States, \n891 F.3d 553, 555-56 (5th Cir. 2018). Then, \u201cby its own \nadmission,\u201d the Commission refused to \u201ccomply[] with \nthe law\u201d requiring it to evaluate that application, \nprompting the D.C. Circuit to issue a writ of mandamus. \nAiken, 725 F.3d at 258.  \n\n5 \n \nBut even that order did not prevent agency intransi-\ngence. Texas, 891 F.3d at 557. Instead, the Commission \nturned to \u201cinterim\u201d facilities, which it hoped would gar-\nner local support. Portuondo, supra. Yet interim storage \nfaces at least three obstacles: (1) Many local communities \ndo not support it; (2) storage is hardly \u201cinterim\u201d where \nthere are no efforts to build a permanent repository; and \n(3) most fundamentally, the statutory directive that \nspent nuclear fuel be stored in Yucca Mountain remains \nin effect. Id. \nII. ISP\u2019s \nApplication \nand \nLicense \nfor \na \n\u201cConsolidated Interim Storage Facility\u201d  \nIn 2016, Interim Storage Partners\u2019 (ISP\u2019s) predeces-\nsor applied for a license to operate a \u201cconsolidated in-\nterim storage facility\u201d where it could house thousands of \nmetric tons of spent nuclear fuel in dry-cask, \nabove-ground storage in Andrews County, Texas, less \nthan a mile from the Texas\u2013New Mexico border. The li-\ncense would be valid for forty years, but ISP may seek to \nrenew it for an additional twenty. J.A.205-06.  \nTexas strenuously objected. On Texas\u2019s behalf, Gov-\nernor Greg Abbott submitted comments explaining why \nspent fuel is too \u201cdangerous\u201d to be placed anywhere \nother than in \u201ca deep geologic repository\u201d and definitely \nshould not be stored on \u201ca concrete pad\u201d atop an oil field \nwhere 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of \nAmerica\u2019s oil reserves. J.A.117-18. If something were to \nhappen\u2014be it terrorism or an accident\u2014the result \nwould devastate the world\u2019s largest producing oil field \nand would significantly harm \u201cthe entire country.\u201d \nJ.A.122.  \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \n(TCEQ) warned that because the Commission has disre-\ngarded Yucca Mountain, ISP\u2019s facility could \u201cbecome the \n\n6 \n \npermanent solution\u201d for the nation\u2019s nuclear waste. \nJ.A.206. Although the Commission says that it \u201cexpects\u201d \nthat the waste will eventually be \u201cshipped to a permanent \ngeologic repository,\u201d J.A.206, the Commission never ad-\ndressed what would happen if\u2014as has been the case for \ndecades\u2014no permanent facility eventuates, J.A.207. \nNew Mexico\u2019s Governor raised similar concerns, warn-\ning of \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the nation\u2019s spent nuclear \nfuel will stay in Texas forever. J.A.212. Nevertheless, the \nCommission licensed ISP\u2019s proposed facility in 2021. \nPet.App.53a. \nIII. Proceedings in the Court of Appeals \nTexas, Governor Abbott, and TCEQ (collectively, \n\u201cTexas\u201d) petitioned for review in the Fifth Circuit, ISP \nintervened, and the Fifth Circuit made two rulings rele-\nvant here. \nFirst, although Texas did not intervene before the \nagency by seeking a hearing, the State fits within the \u201cul-\ntra vires exception to the [Hobbs Act\u2019s] party-aggrieved \nstatus requirement.\u201d Pet.App.18a-20a; see also, e.g., \nLeedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 188-89 (1958) (recognizing \nultra vires review). Alternatively, the Fifth Circuit sug-\ngested that Texas would be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under \nthe Hobbs Act because it \u201cparticipated\u2014in some way\u2014\nin the agency proceedings,\u201d namely by submitting com-\nments, Pet.App.17a-18a.     \nSecond, the Fifth Circuit held that \u201c[w]hat to do with \nthe nation\u2019s ever-growing accumulation of nuclear waste \nis a major question that\u2014as the history of the Yucca \nMountain repository shows\u2014has been hotly politically \ncontested for over half a century.\u201d Pet.App.29a-30a; see \nalso 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). The Commission accordingly \nneeds clear authorization to license private offsite stor-\nage facilities. Pet.App.30a. Yet the AEA does not \n\n7 \n \ndelegate such authority, and the NWPA affirmatively \n\u201cbelies the Commission\u2019s arguments.\u201d Pet.App.31a. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fifth Circuit rejected \nthe Commission\u2019s assertion that because it may license \nthe possession of other nuclear materials, it \u201chas broad \nauthority to license storage facilities for spent nuclear \nfuel.\u201d Pet.App.22a. After all, the Commission may license \npossession of specified materials \u201conly for certain enu-\nmerated purposes\u2014none of which encompass storage or \ndisposal of material as radioactive as spent nuclear fuel.\u201d \nPet.App.22a. The Commission\u2019s contrary argument, the \nFifth Circuit explained, \u201ccannot be reconciled with the \n[NWPA],\u201d Pet.App.26a, which \u201ccreates a comprehensive \nstatutory scheme for addressing spent nuclear fuel accu-\nmulation,\u201d Pet.App.29a.    \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to rehear the case en banc. \nPet.App.32a. Judge Higginson dissented and argued for \nthe elimination of that court\u2019s ultra vires exception. \nPet.App.45a-52a. In response, Judge Jones explained \nwhy the State would be a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d regardless \nof any such exception. Pet.App.33a-44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nWhat to do with the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel impli-\ncates a host of difficult technological, environmental, and \npolitical considerations. Thankfully, that \u201cpolicy debate \nis not\u201d this Court\u2019s \u201cconcern.\u201d Aiken, 725 F.3d at 257. \nBecause Congress has decided how to handle spent nu-\nclear fuel, all that matters is that Yucca Mountain is not \nin Texas and ISP is not the federal government. Petition-\ners\u2019 efforts to evade these foundational points fail.   \nI. Jurisdiction exists for two reasons. First, Texas is \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act because it \nparticipated in agency proceeding by filing comments\u2014\nwhich is both the best reading of the statute and the only \n\n8 \n \nreading that makes sense given that the same provision \ngoverns challenges to adjudications and rulemakings. \nPetitioners have no good answer, instead insisting that \nthe Act is a chameleon, with the meaning of \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d \ndepending \non \nwhether \nan \nagency \npromulgates a rule or issues an order, and that agencies \ncan create jurisdictional exhaustion requirements. Such \na strained reading flunks multiple canons of construction \nand is a recipe for confusion.    \nSecond, Texas can sue to challenge the Commission\u2019s \nacts as ultra vires. Although Petitioners make much of the \nfact that the Hobbs Act nowhere mentions ultra vires \nreview, courts have engaged in nonstatutory review for \ncenturies. If, contrary to reality, the Hobbs Act is \nunavailable here, ultra vires review applies. \nII. On the merits, Petitioners argue that Congress \nnever prohibited private interim, offsite storage \nfacilities. Because \u201can agency literally has no power to \nact \u2026 until Congress confers power upon it,\u201d La. Pub. \nServ. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986), however, \nthe question is not what Congress prohibited, but what \nCongress allowed. Petitioners have no good answer for \nthe fact that Congress repeatedly allowed offsite storage \nat a federal facility, not a private one. \nThis, moreover, \u201cis a major questions case,\u201d West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 724 (2022), or, at mini-\nmum, a no-elephants-in-mouseholes case. Where an \n\u201cissue is one of deep economic and political significance,\u201d \nCongress must delegate clearly because \u201cextraordinary \ngrants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished \nthrough modest words, vague terms, or subtle devices.\u201d \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 405 \n(2024) (citation omitted). Here, Congress recognized that \nwhere to house spent nuclear fuel is a \u201cnational problem\u201d \n\n9 \n \nand a \u201cmajor \u2026 public concern.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2), \n(7). Congress answered that \u201cmajor\u201d question, id., both \nas to interim offsite storage, id. \u00a7\u00a710151-57, and \npermanent disposal, id. \u00a710172(a). Congress\u2019s clear \nanswer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal \nfacilities\u2014not a private facility in Texas.    \nARGUMENT \nI. Texas May Challenge ISP\u2019s Unlawful License.  \nUnder the Hobbs Act, a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by a final \norder may seek review in the court of appeals. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72344. Because ISP all but concedes (at 10) that Fasken \nis a party aggrieved, whether Texas is one too is aca-\ndemic. If the Court reaches this question, however, \nTexas properly sought review as a party aggrieved or be-\ncause the Commission acted ultra vires. \nA. Texas is a \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d \n1. Texas is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d because it \nparticipated in agency proceedings.  \na. The Court\u2019s \u201cstatutory interpretation cases al-\nmost always start with a careful consideration of the text, \nand there is no reason to do otherwise here.\u201d Brnovich v. \nDemocratic Nat\u2019l Comm., 594 U.S. 647, 667 (2021). As \npart of that analysis, courts \u201cshould not interpret each \nword in a statute with blinders on, refusing to look at the \nword\u2019s function within the broader statutory context.\u201d \nAbramski v. United States, 573 U.S. 169, 179 n.6 (2014). \nA provision \u201cthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is of-\nten clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.\u201d \nId. Here, applying this rule leads to one conclusion: To \nbe a \u201cparty aggrieved,\u201d Texas must only have partici-\npated in some way in the agency proceeding.  \nAs the Commission\u2019s own authority recognizes, \nNRC.Br.17, the term \u201cparty\u201d in common parlance \u201cis not \n\n10 \n \nrestricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or defendant in a \nlawsuit, being defined as one concerned in or privy to a \nmatter, as in the relation of accessory or confidant, and \nagain a partial person, one who takes sides.\u201d BLACK\u2019S \nLAW DICTIONARY 1278 (4th ed. 1951). The term includes \nany \u201cperson concerned or having or taking part in any \naffair, matter, transaction, or proceeding.\u201d Id; see also, \ne.g., THE RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH \nLANGUAGE 1416 (2d unabridged ed. 1987). Indeed, the \nCourt has used \u201cperson \u2026 aggrieved\u201d and \u201caggrieved \nparty\u201d interchangeably. Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, \n146 (1993) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7702). Thus, absent a con-\ntrary, specialized meaning, \u201cparty\u201d means \u201cparticipa-\ntor.\u201d XI THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 282 (2d. ed. \n1989). \nThat ordinary meaning controls here. Because of the \nHobbs Act\u2019s breadth, the term \u201cparty\u201d must apply to \n\u201cseveral quite different agencies and several types of \nproceedings,\u201d including adjudications and rulemakings. \nPet.App.38a. After all, the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cclear words\u201d \nmake \u201cno distinction between orders which promulgate \nrules and orders in adjudicative proceedings.\u201d Gage v. \nU.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1218 (D.C. \nCir. 1973). Yet no one disputes that filing comments \nmakes one a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d for a rulemaking chal-\nlenge. Id. Accordingly, where a party filed comments set-\nting forth its legal position, it makes no sense to require \nfurther participation in an evidentiary hearing because \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking does not require hear-\nings. See, e.g., Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. \nNRDC, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 545 (1978).    \nb. This plain-text reading of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d also \ncomports with statutory context. For one thing, the \nHobbs Act expressly explains that unless hearings are \n\n11 \n \notherwise required by law, they are not necessary to \nseek review. \u201cWhen the agency has not held a hearing \nbefore taking the action of which review is sought,\u201d a \n\u201ccourt of appeals shall determine whether a hearing is \nrequired by law\u201d and may \u201cpass on the issues presented\u201d \notherwise. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72347(b)(1)-(2). The court may also \ntransfer the litigation to a district court for a hearing. Id. \n\u00a72347(b)(3). Because jurisdiction attaches irrespective of \nwhether an agency hearing occurred, it cannot be that a \ncourt lacks jurisdiction unless a party seeks a hearing.   \nThe Hobbs Act\u2019s intervention provision reinforces \nthat point. Contra NRC.Br.19; ISP.Br.25-26. A party in \ninterest in an agency proceeding may intervene (often as \na defendant) \u201cas of right\u201d in subsequent court proceed-\nings brought by some other person, but those \u201cwhose in-\nterests are affected by the order of the agency\u201d and who \nare not a party in interest must seek leave to intervene \nin such litigation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72348. By its terms, this pro-\nvision governs who may intervene in court, but says \nnothing about who may institute judicial proceedings. \nThat Congress distinguished between instituting review \nand intervention precludes conflating the concepts. Nor \ncould the Act work otherwise\u2014there is no party in inter-\nest in rulemaking. \nAlabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir. \n2002), is not to the contrary. Contra NRC.Br.19; \nISP.Br.25-26. There, the Eleventh Circuit recognized \nthat a \u201c\u2018party aggrieved\u2019 is one who participated in the \nagency proceeding,\u201d id. at 1366 (emphasis added)\u2014\nTexas\u2019s position. But multiple adjudications occurred in \nthat case. Id. at 1365-67. The court concluded that par-\nticipating in one adjudication does not make someone a \nparty aggrieved by a different adjudication. Id. Whether \nan entity that had participated in some other way in the \n\n12 \n \nagency proceeding could seek review was not at issue. Id. \nat 1366-67.    \nc. Reading the word \u201cparty\u201d to mean \u201cparticipant\u201d \nalso comports with the purpose of the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nrequirement: namely, \u201cto ensure that the agency had the \nopportunity to consider the issue that petitioners are \nconcerned with.\u201d Pet.App.17a; see Gage, 479 F.2d at \n1219. This allows agencies to compile the administrative \nrecord, the \u201cfocal point\u201d for judicial review. Fla. Power \n& Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 743 (1985). \nThis case proves as much. The Commission received \nTexas\u2019s objections while the proceeding was ongoing. \nJ.A.117-22, 203-08. But the Commission had already re-\njected such legal arguments. See, e.g., Private Fuel Stor-\nage L.L.C., 56 N.R.C. 390, 392 (Dec. 18, 2002). It thus \nwould serve no purpose to require Texas to seek an evi-\ndentiary hearing to advance a legal argument the Com-\nmission had already rejected. \nd. Finally, if any doubts existed, the \u201cstrong pre-\nsumption favoring judicial review of administrative ac-\ntion\u201d squelches it. Salinas v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., 592 U.S. \n188, 196 (2021) (citation omitted). Nothing suggests that \nCongress overcame that presumption by embedding in \nthe Hobbs Act a term whose meaning supposedly \nchanges depending on the form of proceeding an agency \nuses. And Congress plainly did not enact such a chame-\nleon-like provision to allow an agency to block judicial re-\nview by denying intervention based on its view of the \nmerits, as happened to Fasken and would have happened \nto Texas.   \n2. The Commission may not limit a court\u2019s \njurisdiction.  \nBeyond what the Hobbs Act says, the Court should \nnot lose sight of what the Hobbs Act is\u2014a jurisdictional \n\n13 \n \nstatute. Jurisdictional statutes trigger special rules of in-\nterpretation that also require affirmance.   \na. Because \u201c[o]nly Congress may determine a lower \nfederal court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction,\u201d Hamer v. \nNeighborhood Housing Servs. of Chi., 583 U.S. 17, 19 \n(2017), it follows that \u201c[w]ithin constitutional bounds, \nCongress decides what cases the federal courts have ju-\nrisdiction to consider\u201d and \u201cunder what conditions,\u201d \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 212-13 (2007). \u201cSepara-\ntion-of-powers concerns, moreover, caution \u2026 against \nreading legislation, absent clear statement, to place in \nexecutive hands authority to remove cases from the Ju-\ndiciary\u2019s domain.\u201d Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 237 \n(2010). Because Congress does not lightly let foxes guard \nhenhouses, it is \u201caxiomatic\u201d that \u201cagencies can neither \ngrant nor curtail federal court jurisdiction.\u201d Carlyle \nTowers Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 170 F.3d 301, 310 \n(2d Cir. 1999). \nHere, neither the AEA nor the Hobbs Act authorizes \nthe Commission to impose jurisdictional requirements \non federal courts\u2014and certainly not clearly enough to \novercome the clear-statement rule. The AEA says that \n\u201cthe Commission shall grant a hearing upon the request \nof any person whose interest may be affected by the pro-\nceeding, and shall admit such person as a party to such \nproceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72239(a)(1)(A) (emphases added). \nIf someone requests a hearing, the Commission thus \nmust make that person a party. But see supra p. 12 (not-\ning that the Commission blocked Fasken from interven-\ning); infra pp. 16-17, 24. But it does not say someone \nmust request a hearing to seek judicial review. If it did, \nthe AEA would superimpose a jurisdictional require-\nment onto the Hobbs Act\u2014a different statute addressing \nmany agencies having nothing to do with the AEA. \n\n14 \n \nNor \ndoes \nthe \nHobbs \nAct \nrequire \nfollowing \nagency-created rules before seeking judicial review. Of \ncourse, when Congress conditions judicial review on com-\npliance with agency procedures, those procedures can be \njurisdictional. E.g., Richman Bros. Records, Inc. v. FCC, \n124 F.3d 1302, 1303 (D.C. Cir. 1997). But when Congress \nwants compliance with them to be \u201ca condition precedent \nto judicial review,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7155(c)(7), it says so\u2014ex-\npressly, id.; see also, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7717r(a); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71997e(a). Indeed, Congress explicitly enacted a juris-\ndictional exhaustion requirement for the FCC (another \nagency covered by the Hobbs Act) in the Communica-\ntions Act but did not do so for the NRC in the AEA. See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7405(a), (b)(2); see also, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7717r(a); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a71997e(a).      \nb. Congress\u2019s use of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d is also not a \npermission slip for agencies to create jurisdictional ex-\nhaustion requirements for three additional reasons. \nFirst, \u201c[w]hen a statute is reasonably susceptible to \ndivergent interpretation,\u201d the Court \u201cadopt[s] the read-\ning that accords with traditional understandings and \nbasic principles: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Kucana, 558 U.S. at 251. \nThe Court has \u201cconsistently applied that interpretive \nguide\u201d and \u201cassumes that Congress legislates with \nknowledge of the presumption,\u201d id. at 251-52 (cleaned \nup). Because Congress has not clearly indicated that the \nCommission can impose jurisdictional requirements, the \npresumption holds. \nSecond, Congress \u201cdoes not hide elephants in mouse-\nholes\u201d or \u201calter the fundamental details of a regulatory \nscheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\u201d Whit-\nman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). \nHere, far from the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d \n\n15 \n \nneeded \u201cto dislodge the presumption,\u201d Kucana, 558 U.S. \nat 252, \u201cCongress intended to provide for initial court of \nappeals review of all final orders in licensing proceedings \nwhether or not a hearing before the Commission oc-\ncurred or could have occurred,\u201d Lorion, 470 U.S. at 737 \n(emphasis added).   \nThird, exhaustion requirements are essentially never \njurisdictional. E.g., Santos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. \n411, 417 (2023). So even if the AEA imposes such a re-\nquirement (it doesn\u2019t), it would not bar review. \nc. Reading \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d as \u201cparticipant\u201d also \navoids jurisdictional confusion. \u201c[A]dministrative sim-\nplicity is a major virtue in a jurisdictional statute.\u201d Hertz \nCorp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 79 (2010). Not only do com-\nplex jurisdictional rules \u201cencourage gamesmanship\u201d and \n\u201ceat[] up time and money,\u201d but they burn \u201c[j]udicial re-\nsources,\u201d as courts must raise such issues sua sponte. Id. \nat 94. \nHere, ascribing jurisdictional consequences to the \ndistinction between rulemaking and adjudication is a rec-\nipe for confusion. The line between the two can be paper \nthin\u2014especially after SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. \n194 (1947). Congress defined \u201crule\u201d as \u201cthe whole or a \npart of an agency statement of general or particular ap-\nplicability\u201d and \u201cadjudication\u201d largely as what\u2019s left over. \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4)-(7) (emphases added). Decades of bewil-\nderment have ensued. See Ronald M. Levin, The Case for \n(Finally) Fixing the APA\u2019s Definition of \u201cRule,\u201d 56 AD-\nMIN. L. REV. 1077 (2004). An agency\u2019s choice of label is \nnot dispositive, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Home Builders v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 417 F.3d 1272, 1284-85 (D.C. Cir. \n2005), and an agency may solicit comments in an adjudi-\ncation, e.g., Neustar, Inc. v. FCC, 857 F.3d 886, 895 (D.C. \nCir. 2017), while holding an evidentiary hearing in a \n\n16 \n \nrulemaking, e.g., Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 524. And the \nFCC\u2014perhaps the most common Hobbs Act litigant\u2014\nsometimes switches between the two categories in the \nmiddle of a single proceeding or issues one decision that \nis both a rulemaking and an adjudication. See Qwest \nServs. Corp. v. FCC, 509 F.3d 531, 535-36 (D.C. Cir. \n2007).  \nIf \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d means \u201cparticipant,\u201d such con-\nfusion between rulemaking and adjudication is relatively \nharmless because courts can tell whether a litigant filed \ncomments or otherwise participated in agency proceed-\nings. But if the existence of a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction \ndepends on which category applies, commenters will be \nforced to flood agencies with motions to intervene in the \nface of any ambiguity. Moreover, if failure to follow an \nagency\u2019s procedural rules can bar judicial review, courts \nwill have to determine in every case\u2014potentially sua \nsponte, and without knowing the full universe of relevant \nrules or even having access to the full record\u2014whether \nevery procedure was followed. And if failure to follow \nonly certain rules may bar \u201cparty\u201d status, courts will \nhave to determine which rules are jurisdictional before \ndoublechecking whether those particular rules were fol-\nlowed. Courts also will be forced to resolve ancillary liti-\ngation regarding alleged violations of the rules and de-\nvelop new doctrines to prevent agencies from creating \njurisdictional traps or using ticky-tack violations to de-\nfeat judicial review.      \nd. Finally, the principle that jurisdiction and the \nmerits are distinct also supports jurisdiction. Whether a \nclaim is meritorious \u201cdoes not implicate subject-matter \njurisdiction, i.e., the court\u2019s \u2026 power to adjudicate the \ncase.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, \n89 (1998). Yet here, the Commission refused to let \n\n17 \n \nFasken intervene\u2014thereby, in Petitioners\u2019 view, pre-\ncluding review of the subsequent licensing order\u2014be-\ncause the Commission believed Fasken was wrong on the \nmerits. See In re Interim Storage Partners LLC, 90 \nN.R.C. 31, 52 (2019). Nothing in \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d em-\npowers agencies to control access to courts by making \nsuch threshold merits determinations.  \n3. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments fail. \nPetitioners advance at least six counterarguments. \nNone persuades.  \nFirst, the Commission asks the Court (at 17-18) to \nuse cases construing the False Claims Act or arising in \nthe class-action context to interpret the Hobbs Act term \n\u201cparty.\u201d But the presumption that \u201cthe same term has \nthe same meaning\u201d is not an ironclad rule even when the \nterm appears \u201cin a single statute.\u201d Env\u2019t Def. v. Duke \nEnergy Corp., 549 U.S. 561, 574 (2007). After all, \u201cmost \nwords have different shades of meaning and conse-\nquently may be variously construed.\u201d Id. \nHere, the Hobbs Act is a different statute\u2014one with \nits own context and history. And it would be particularly \ninappropriate to look across contexts with respect to the \nmeaning of the term \u201cparty,\u201d as the Court has already \nrecognized that the meaning of that specific term varies. \nFor example, another of Petitioners\u2019 cases\u2014this one in \nthe bankruptcy context\u2014adopts Texas\u2019s view of the \u201cor-\ndinary meaning\u201d of \u201cparty\u201d: namely, \u201cone concerned in \nan affair; a participator.\u201d Truck Ins. Exch. v. Kaiser \nGypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268, 278 (2024) (quoting WEB-\nSTER\u2019S NEW INT\u2019L DICTIONARY 1784 (2d. ed. 1949)).      \nSecond, Petitioners make much of the distinction be-\ntween the terms \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d in the Hobbs Act and \n\u201cperson ... aggrieved\u201d in \u00a7702 of the APA. NRC.Br.18; \nISP.Br.24. This Court, however, read \u201cperson \u2026 \n\n18 \n \naggrieved\u201d and \u201caggrieved party\u201d interchangeably in \nDarby. 509 U.S. at 146. To be sure, then-Judge Scalia \nreasoned that to \u201cgive meaning to that apparently inten-\ntional variation, [courts] must read \u2018party\u2019 as referring to \na party before the agency, not a party to the judicial pro-\nceeding.\u201d Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But he said nothing about the question here: how \nsomeone becomes a \u201cparty\u201d before an agency. And when \nhe joined this Court, he explained that \u201cperson \u2026 ag-\ngrieved\u201d requires only that a plaintiff (1) \u201cidentify some \nagency action that affects him\u201d and (2) \u201cshow that he has \nsuffered legal wrong because of the challenged agency \naction.\u201d Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n882-83 (1990) (quotation marks omitted). It does not re-\nquire intervening in agency proceedings.   \nThird, the Commission relies (at 19-20) on the AEA\u2019s \ndistinction between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cparty.\u201d But the ques-\ntion is whether Texas may seek review under the Hobbs \nAct, not the AEA. The Hobbs Act covers many agen-\ncies\u2014not just the Commission\u2014so the AEA does not \ndictate the Hobbs Act\u2019s meaning. Nor does the Commis-\nsion\u2019s argument work on its own terms. The relevant \nAEA provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a72239(a)(1)(A), shows that one \nway to become a party is to request a hearing. Because \nthe Hobbs Act applies to rulemakings and adjudications \nalike, that cannot be the only way to become a party. Nei-\nther does the AEA require anyone to seek a hearing. \nFourth, Petitioners argue that agencies must be able \nto create procedures for their own proceedings, and ISP \ninvokes the specter of someone \u201cslipping a handwritten \nnote under the door of the agency headquarters after the \ndeadline for comments has passed.\u201d ISP.Br.27. But filing \ncomments after a proceeding is over is not participation. \n\n19 \n \nTimely submitting comments in connection with a pend-\ning proceeding is different in kind. \nISP\u2019s example, moreover, reveals the danger of Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position. Under their logic, an agency could de-\nprive the indigent of judicial review simply by promul-\ngating rules with onerous formatting requirements like \nbarring handwritten comments or demanding that all \nsubmissions be on 8.5\u201d x 14\u201d paper. Petitioners\u2019 view that \nsubmitting comments to an agency has no more jurisdic-\ntional significance than filing an amicus brief is also \nwrong. NRC.Br.28; ISP.Br.26. Congress directs how \nsomeone becomes a party in court or before an agency. \nHere, no one disputes that under the Hobbs Act, filing \ncomments to an agency can make someone a party for \npurposes of judicial review. The only question is whether \nagency-created procedures can curtail that right to re-\nview for some proceedings.     \nFifth, Petitioners lean heavily on a handful of \nlower-court decisions, NRC.Br.28; ISP.Br.25, but such \ncases underscore why jurisdiction exists here. For exam-\nple, Ohio Nuclear-free Network v. NRC, 53 F.4th 236 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022), claims that \u201cinvocation of the appropri-\nate and available administrative procedure \u2026 is the stat-\nutorily prescribed prerequisite for this court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion to entertain a petition to review a final NRC order,\u201d \nid. at 240 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). But \nthat is not what the Hobbs Act says, and Petitioners can-\nnot wring an exhaustion requirement out of the word \n\u201cparty.\u201d NRDC v. NRC, 823 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2016), \nand State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th 1112 (10th \nCir. 2023), are unpersuasive for similar reasons. \nIn all events, even if these cases were correct a year \nago, they are anachronisms today. Consider Balderas, \nwhich held that \u201cto assess status as a party,\u201d courts must \n\n20 \n \nfocus on \u201cthe practices of the agency.\u201d 59 F.4th at 1117. \nThe Tenth Circuit reasoned that \u201cif the Commission had \nrequired intervention and New Mexico didn\u2019t seek leave \nto intervene,\u201d then courts \u201cwould lack jurisdiction under \nthe Hobbs Act.\u201d Id. But agency practices cannot define a \njurisdictional statute. Because agencies no more \u201cadmin-\nister\u201d the Hobbs Act than they \u201cadminister\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a71331, such analysis would not work even under Chev-\nron. See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. \n837, 842 (1984). But it cannot possibly be correct after \nLoper Bright.  \nNor does it matter how long the Commission\u2019s rules \nhave existed. Contra ISP.Br.25. The Commission can \ncreate rules for its proceedings. The question here is \nwhether compliance with those rules is a jurisdictional \nrequirement for judicial review. The Commission\u2019s rules \ndo not purport to govern a court\u2019s jurisdiction. And even \nif they did, \u201c[a] regulation\u2019s age is no antidote to clear \ninconsistency with a statute.\u201d Brown v. Gardner, 513 \nU.S. 115, 122 (1994). Because Texas is a \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act, jurisdiction exists.  \nFinally, Petitioners retreat to policy. ISP complains \n(at 28) that \u201c[i]f any person can sue in court,\u201d there would \nbe no point in having \u201cextensive safety-based adjudica-\ntory hearings at the agency level at all.\u201d But it is not true \nthat \u201cany person\u201d may seek review\u2014a person must have \nparticipated in agency proceedings and have standing. \nMoreover, an \u201cextensive safety-based adjudicatory hear-\ning[],\u201d ISP.Br.28, may make sense for factual objections, \nbut not for questions of law, cf. Carr v. Saul, 593 U.S. 83, \n92-93 (2021). Even if exhaustion of legal issues could be \nrelevant, it would have been futile here because the Com-\nmission \u201cpredetermined\u201d its view of the State\u2019s argu-\nments. McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 148 (1992); \n\n21 \n \nsupra p. 12. ISP\u2019s rhetoric, moreover, elides that the \nHobbs Act does not require hearings. Supra pp. 10-11. \nIn fact, to the extent policy is relevant, it cuts against \nPetitioners. The rule from this case will apply not only to \ngovernments and energy companies, but also to victims \nof housing discrimination and small farmers. E.g., \n28 U.S.C. \u00a72342(2), (6). Many people lack the resources \nor training to intervene in complex agency proceedings. \nPetitioners\u2019 logic would also allow agencies covered by \nthe Hobbs Act to add onerous, confusing, or pointless \nhoops before such a commenter can be a \u201cparty\u201d to a \nrulemaking. The Court should not ascribe to Congress \nthe intent to deprive anyone of his or her day in court.       \nB. Courts may enjoin ultra vires action. \n1. Nonstatutory review applies here.  \nIn all events, courts need not rely on a specific statute \nwhere, as here, agency action is ultra vires. \na. Nonstatutory review has been a feature of our law \nfor centuries. \u201cIndeed, the most famous case of all, Mar-\nbury v. Madison, was a nonstatutory review case,\u201d and \n\u201cChief Justice Marshall himself applied nonstatutory re-\nview again in the well-known case of Osborn v. Bank of \nthe United States.\u201d Jonathan R. Siegel, Suing the Presi-\ndent: Nonstatutory Review Revisited, 97 COLUM. L. \nREV. 1612, 1625 (1997). In neither case did the plaintiff \nhave a \u201cspecific, statutory mechanism\u201d to sue under, yet \nthe Court held that relief was available via mandamus or \nthe common law. Id. at 1633. And throughout much of the \nearly republic, takings lawsuits were resolved not \nthrough statutory causes of action\u2014which did not exist \nuntil the Tucker Act\u2014but through nonstatutory relief. \nUnited States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); accord DeVil-\nlier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 292-93 (2024); Knick v. Town-\nship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 197-201 (2019). \n\n22 \n \nThose challenging agency action also historically \nhave not relied on a cause of action like the APA\u2019s to chal-\nlenge ultra vires action. See, e.g., Aditya Bamzai, The Or-\nigins of Judicial Deference to Executive Interpretation, \n126 YALE L.J. 908, 948, 972 & n.271 (2017). Review was \navailable where an agency head \u201cexceeded his authority \nor this court should be of opinion that his action was \nclearly wrong.\u201d Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, 194 U.S. 106, \n109 (1904). Hence, \u201c[l]ong before the APA, the \u2018main \nweapon in the arsenal for attacking federal administra-\ntive action\u2019 was a suit in equity seeking injunctive relief.\u201d \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S Dep\u2019t of Com., 39 F.4th 756, \n763 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting KENNETH CULP DAVIS & \nRICHARD J. PIERCE, JR., ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREA-\nTISE \u00a718.4, at 179 (3d ed. 1994)).   \nSuch review has continued into modern times. No \nstatute provided a cause of action in, for example, \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 \n(1952). Siegel, supra, at 1636, 1672 & n.265. And \u201creview \nof federal agency action is available when an agency ac-\ntion is ultra vires, that is, when the agency has plainly \nviolated an unambiguous and mandatory legal require-\nment.\u201d Cole, supra, at 3 n.33 (citing, inter alia, Kyne, 358 \nU.S. at 188-89; Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. \nCorp., 337 U.S. 682, 689-90 (1949)). Courts thus need not \nrely on statutory causes of action \u201cto strike down an \n[agency] order \u2026 made in excess of [the agency\u2019s] dele-\ngated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the \nAct.\u201d Kyne, 358 U.S. at 188. \nb. The Fifth Circuit properly applied this longstand-\ning body of law, explaining that ultra vires review allows \na person who was \u201cnot a party to the original agency pro-\nceeding\u201d to seek review \u201cwhere,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe agency \naction is attacked as exceeding [its] power.\u201d Pet.App.19a. \n\n23 \n \nAs Judge Jones explained, the doctrine \u201cliterally refers \nto being \u2018outside\u2019 the agency\u2019s power, i.e. in defiance of \nthe limits placed by Congress in the agency\u2019s governing \nstatute or the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.43a. Such analysis \nechoes Larson, where this Court explained that if an \u201cof-\nficer\u2019s powers are limited by statute, his actions beyond \nthose limitations\u201d are \u201cultra vires\u201d and so \u201cmay be made \nthe object of specific relief.\u201d 337 U.S. at 689.  \nFor reasons explained by the Fifth Circuit and set \nforth below, \u201c[t]he Commission has no statutory author-\nity to issue the license.\u201d Pet.App.21a; infra Part II. It is \nnot a close question. An apt term to describe such defi-\nance of Congress is ultra vires.   \n2. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments again fail.  \nPetitioners deride ultra vires review as atextual, \nNRC.Br.20; ISP.Br.19, yet ignore history. \u201cStatutes \nwhich invade the common law \u2026 are to be read with a \npresumption favoring the retention of long-established \nand familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose \nto the contrary is evident.\u201d United States v. Texas, 507 \nU.S. 529, 534 (1993). It is implausible that Congress dis-\nplaced longstanding common law with the phrase \u201cparty \naggrieved.\u201d E.g., Fed. Express, 39 F.4th at 763 (nonstat-\nutory review survived APA\u2019s enactment).  \nNor is ultra vires a synonym for \u201cwrong,\u201d and it does \nnot require courts to draw \u201chighly malleable distinc-\ntions\u201d between claims. Contra ISP.Br.22; NRC.Br.15. \nCourts have long protected against ultra vires action. \nPetitioners\u2019 concerns, moreover, ring particularly hollow \nnow that courts \u201cmay not defer to an agency interpreta-\ntion of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.\u201d \nLoper Bright, 603 U.S. at 413. Nothing about an admin-\nistrative record, the \u201cfocal point for judicial review,\u201d Lo-\nrion, 470 U.S. at 743, speaks to what a statute means.   \n\n24 \n \nPetitioners insist that cases like Kyne are irrelevant \nbecause \u201cthere is a meaningful and adequate opportunity \nfor judicial review under the relevant statute.\u201d ISP.Br.21 \n(referencing Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. \nMCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)). Fasken was \nrefused intervention because the Commission did not \nthink Fasken\u2019s arguments were meritorious. The same \nwould have happened to Texas; after all, the Commission \npreviously rejected Texas\u2019s primary legal objections. \nThis conflation of the merits and jurisdiction misreads \nthe Hobbs Act, but if Petitioners were correct, it would \nbe proof positive there is not \u201ca meaningful and adequate \nopportunity for judicial review.\u201d Petitioners cannot have \nit both ways.  \nII. Congress Has Not Authorized the Commission to \nLicense Private, Offsite Storage Facilities. \nCongress mandated that spent nuclear fuel should be \npermanently disposed of at Yucca Mountain. Congress \njust as clearly mandated that temporary storage may \ntake place at only one of two locations: the reactor site or \na federally operated facility. That language controls.   \nA. The Commission has limited authority to \nlicense offsite storage. \n1. The AEA does not allow ISP\u2019s license.  \na. Petitioners appear to agree that the AEA is silent \nregarding the key issue here\u2014whether the Commission \nmay license a private entity to possess or store spent nu-\nclear fuel. As the Commission\u2019s Chairman recognized in \n1978, the AEA \u201cdoes not explicitly authorize regulation \nof radioactive waste facilities.\u201d1 That silence is all but \n \n1 NRC, NUREG-0527, Regulation of Federal Radioactive \nWaste Activities: Report to Congress on Extending the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission\u2019s Licensing or Regulatory Authority to \n\n25 \n \ndispositive. Because agencies \u201care creatures of statute,\u201d \nthey \u201chave no inherent powers\u201d and \u201cmay act only be-\ncause, and only to the extent that, Congress affirma-\ntively has delegated them the power to act.\u201d Am. Bus. \nAss\u2019n v. Slater, 231 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (Sentelle, \nJ., concurring). \nNor can Petitioners draw support from what Con-\ngress allowed the Commission to do. Unlike the sweep-\ning grants of authority that generated concern in recent \nyears, see, e.g., Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128 \n(2019), the AEA is highly reticulated. The Commission \nmay \u201cissue licenses to,\u201d among other things, \u201cpossess \u2026 \nspecial nuclear material,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a), \u201cdistribute \nsource material within the United States to qualified ap-\nplicants requesting such material,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a), and \u201cuse \nbyproduct material,\u201d id. \u00a72111(a). Even then, licenses \nare purpose-specific: Licensees cannot do just anything \nwith such materials; they can do only things like research \nand development, medical testing, or national defense. \nId. \u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), 2111(a), 2201(b).  \nPetitioners have not identified a statute that allows \nthe Commission to license private, offsite possession of \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d the material at issue here. Rather, \nCongress distinguished \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d from \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource material[],\u201d and \u201cbyprod-\nuct material[]\u201d when it required the Commission to \u201ces-\ntablish a system\u201d to ensure the secure transfer of \u201cby-\nproduct materials, source materials, special nuclear \nmaterials, high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear \nfuel, transuranic waste, and low-level radioactive waste.\u201d \n \nFederal Radioactive Waste Storage and Disposal Activities at G-9 \n(Sept. \n1979), \nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Regula-\ntion_of_Federal_Radioactive_Waste/ERpSAAAA-\nMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0. \n\n26 \n \nId. \u00a72210i(a)-(b) (emphases added). Indeed, Congress \nseparately defined \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource \nmaterial,\u201d \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d and \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a72014, confirming their separateness. \nBecause the AEA expressly distinguishes \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d from materials the Commission may license, \u201cit is \nfair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed \npossibility\u201d of authorizing licenses for such material \u201cand \nmeant to say no to it.\u201d Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 \nU.S. 371, 381 (2013) (quotation marks omitted). \nb. Even if the AEA authorized licenses for pos-\nsessing spent nuclear fuel, it does not do so for storing it. \nThe Commission may grant licenses to \u201cpossess \u2026 spe-\ncial nuclear material,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a), \u201cissue licenses \nfor and to distribute source material,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a), or li-\ncense \u201cuse\u201d of \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d id. \u00a72111(a)\u2014but \nonly for particular activities. For example, the Commis-\nsion may license an entity to \u201cpossess,\u201d id. \u00a72073(a), \n\u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d or \u201csource material\u201d only for \nresearch \nand \ndevelopment, \nid. \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a)(1)-(2), \n2093(a)(1)-(2), \u201cmedical therapy,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2), \u201cutilization or production facilities,\u201d id. \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3); see id. \u00a72133(a), or \u201csuch other \nuses as the Commission determines to be appropriate to \ncarry out the purposes of this chapter,\u201d id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), \n2093(a)(4). Likewise, it may license the \u201cuse\u201d of \u201cbyprod-\nuct material\u201d only for research and development, medi-\ncal therapy, \u201cindustrial uses, agricultural uses, or such \nother useful applications as may be developed.\u201d Id. \n\u00a72111(a).  \nThe Commission did not license ISP to possess spent \nnuclear fuel for any of these purposes. Pet.App.55a. Nei-\nther Petitioner argues to the contrary\u2014for example, \nthat ISP\u2019s license concerns \u201cresearch and development\u201d \n\n27 \n \nor \u201cmedical therapy.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(1)-(2), \n2093(a)(1)-(2), 2111(a).    \nNor does ISP\u2019s license pertain to \u201cutilization or pro-\nduction facilities,\u201d each of which also has a specific defi-\nnition. Id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3). A \u201c[u]tilization facil-\nity\u201d is \u201cany equipment or device, except an atomic \nweapon,\u201d that the Commission has determined is \u201ccapa-\nble of making use of special nuclear material\u201d in signifi-\ncant ways. Id. \u00a72014(cc), (cc)(1); see also id. \u00a72014(cc)(2). \nAnd a \u201cproduction facility\u201d includes \u201cany equipment or \ndevice\u201d that the Commission determines is \u201ccapable of \nthe production of special nuclear material\u201d in significant \nways. Id. \u00a72014(v)(1); see also id. \u00a72014(v)(2). ISP\u2019s li-\ncense does not authorize ISP to use \u201cspecial nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d\u2014which is, again, different from \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d supra pp. 25-26\u2014in any \u201cequipment or device,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72014(cc)(1)-(2). Neither does it authorize ISP \nto \u201cmake, produce, or refine\u201d anything. Id. \u00a72014(u).  \nThe catchall provisions, id. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), \n2111(a), cannot fill this gap. \u201c[C]ourts \u2026 interpret a \u2018gen-\neral or collective term\u2019 at the end of a list of specific\u201d \nterms \u201cin light of any \u2018common attribute[s]\u2019\u201d the \u201cspecific \nitems\u201d share. Sw. Airlines Co. v. Saxon, 596 U.S. 450, 458 \n(2022) (quotation marks omitted); see also ANTONIN \nSCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE IN-\nTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 199 (2012). Thus, a \n\u201cgeneral or collective term at the end of a list of specific \nitems is typically controlled and defined by reference to \nthe specific classes \u2026 that precede it.\u201d Fischer v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) (quotation marks omit-\nted).   \nThe specific uses for which the Commission may li-\ncense possession or use of the enumerated materials thus \n\u201ccontrol[s] and define[s],\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. \n\n28 \n \nAdams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001), the \u201cother uses\u201d for \nwhich the Commission may license possession or use. \nEach of the specifically listed activities involves an af-\nfirmative, productive application of the material. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), 2111(a). Storage (whether \ntemporary or permanent) does not.    \n2. The NWPA also dooms ISP\u2019s license.  \na. Even if the AEA, standing alone, were ambigu-\nous, the NWPA requires affirming the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njudgment. Statutes \u201cdealing with the same subject,\u201d like \nthe AEA and NWPA, \u201cbeing in pari materia,\u201d \u201care to be \ninterpreted together, as though they were one law.\u201d \nSCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 252 (emphasis omitted). \n\u201cStatutes cannot be read intelligently if the eye is closed \nto considerations evidenced in affiliated statutes.\u201d Felix \nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Stat-\nutes, 47 COLUM. L. REV. 527, 539 (1947). So, \u201ca \u2018later act \ncan \u2026 be regarded as a legislative interpretation of [an] \nearlier act \u2026 in the sense that it aids in ascertaining the \nmeaning of the words as used in their contemporary set-\nting.\u2019\u201d Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243-44 \n(1972) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. \nStewart, 311 U.S. 60, 64-65 (1940)); see id. at 244 (indicat-\ning that this canon can help resolve textual ambiguities). \nThe NWPA limits the type of facilities the Commis-\nsion may license to \u201cprovide for the permanent disposal \nof \u2026 spent nuclear fuel.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(4). Until \nthe federal government fulfills the Yucca Mountain man-\ndate, the Department may not consider, id. \u00a710101(18), \nand the Commission may not license, a repository any-\nwhere else, id. \u00a7\u00a75842, 10172. Furthermore, Congress \nprovided for temporary offsite storage\u2014but only in fed-\neral repositories, and only under certain circumstances. \nId. \u00a7\u00a710151, 10155-56. \n\n29 \n \nb. Numerous features of the NWPA confirm that the \nCommission cannot grant ISP\u2019s license. First, ISP\u2019s fa-\ncility will likely be anything but temporary. For over \nthirty-five years, the Executive Branch has refused to \ncomply with Congress\u2019s directives about Yucca Moun-\ntain. The Commission offers no reason to believe that the \nnext forty years\u2014or more\u2014will be different. The Com-\nmission \u201capparently has no long-term plan other than \nhoping for a geologic repository,\u201d and if it \u201ccontinues to \nfail in its quest to establish one,\u201d then spent nuclear fuel \nmust \u201cbe stored\u201d at purportedly \u201ctemporary\u201d storage \nsites \u201con a permanent basis.\u201d New York, 681 F.3d at 479. \nBefore granting this license, the federal government \nmade clear that it would not pursue a facility in Yucca \nMountain\u2014the only authorized permanent repository. \nAny assurance that this license is temporary is thus un-\nserious. The Court is \u201cnot required to exhibit a naivet\u00e9 \nfrom which ordinary citizens are free.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (quotation marks \nomitted). \n \nSecond, even if a presumption of good faith required \nassuming that the ISP facility will be temporary, it would \nnot save the license. Congress has declared that \u201cthe per-\nsons owning and operating civilian nuclear power reac-\ntors have the primary responsibility for providing in-\nterim storage of spent nuclear fuel from such reactors, \nby maximizing, to the extent practical, the effective use \nof existing storage facilities at the site of each civilian \nnuclear power reactor\u201d and \u201cby adding new onsite stor-\nage capacity in a timely manner where practical.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710151(a)(1) (emphasis added); accord id. \n\u00a710151(b)(1). It thus charged the Commission to \u201cexpe-\ndite \u2026 the addition of [any] needed new storage capacity \nat the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor\u201d to meet \n\n30 \n \nthat end. Id. \u00a710151(a)(2); see also id. \u00a710152 (using \n\u201cshall\u201d). Congress thus indicated that outside of limited \nexceptions for federal facilities, reactors should store \ntheir own spent fuel onsite until a permanent national re-\npository is built.   \nTrue, Congress recognized that sometimes, storage \nat a reactor site might not be able \u201creasonably [to] pro-\nvide adequate storage capacity.\u201d Id. \u00a710151(a)(3). In \nthose circumstances, Congress ordered the federal gov-\nernment to \u201cprovide\u201d limited \u201cinterim storage\u201d capacity \n\u201cof spent nuclear fuel\u201d away from the reactor site. Id. \nEven then, however, Congress limited the circumstances \nunder which the federal government may \u201cprovide\u201d such \nstorage: It may do so only at a federal facility. Id. \n\u00a7\u00a710151-57. It may also construct \u201cmonitored retrievable \nstorage\u201d facilities, id. \u00a7\u00a710161-69, but that category does \nnot encompass ISP\u2019s proposed facility, id. \u00a710161(b). \nThus, the Commission may license interim storage only \nif it is (1) located at the reactor site or (2) federally owned \nand operated. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710151, 10155. ISP\u2019s facility \nis neither.  \nThird, Congress declared that \u201c[n]otwithstanding \nany other\u201d law, \u201cnothing in\u201d the NWPA \u201cshall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or \nFederal use, purchase, lease, or other acquisition of any \nstorage facility located away from the site of any civilian \nnuclear power reactor and not owned by the Federal \nGovernment\u201d on the date of the NWPA\u2019s enactment. Id. \n\u00a710155(h). Yet ISP\u2019s facility is not located at a reactor \nsite and (of course) not federal.   \nThese provisions confirm that the Commission can-\nnot license a private, offsite interim storage facility for \nspent nuclear fuel. ISP tries (at 3-4, 9-10) to portray this \nclear language as unfairly punishing industry for the \n\n31 \n \nfederal government\u2019s mistakes. But the statute says \nwhat it says, and it is for Congress\u2014not the Commis-\nsion\u2014to change it. Regardless, equity hardly favors ISP. \nUnder the NWPA, Texas was supposed to enjoy statu-\ntory protections, including a veto over siting of an in-\nterim-storage facility that only Congress could override. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710136, 10155(d), 10156(e), 10166, 10169. \nUnfortunately, the Commission ignored those require-\nments, too. \n3. The major-questions and no-elephants-in-\nmouseholes doctrines also apply.  \na. Additional rules of interpretation further confirm \nthat Congress never authorized this license. \nThe major-questions doctrine serves two purposes. \nFirst, it \u201cis a tool for discerning\u2014not departing from\u2014\nthe text\u2019s most natural interpretation.\u201d Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S.Ct. 2355, 2376 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring). It starts from the premise that Congress \n\u201cspeak[s] clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise \npowers of \u2018vast \u201ceconomic and political significance.\u201d\u2019\u201d \nAla. Ass\u2019n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) \n(per curiam) (quoting Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 \nU.S. 302, 324 (2014)). Second, it helps effectuate \nnondelegation principles. \u201cMuch as constitutional rules \nabout retroactive legislation and sovereign immunity \nhave their corollary clear-statement rules, Article I\u2019s \nVesting Clause has its own: the major questions \ndoctrine.\u201d West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 740 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). Congress thus must speak clearly when \ndelegating authority to address questions with a fraught \n\u201cpolitical history,\u201d including \u201cCongress\u2019s creation of \u2018a \ndistinct regulatory scheme\u2019\u201d and the \u201cindustry\u2019s \n\u2018significant\u2019 role in \u2018the American economy.\u2019\u201d Nebraska, \n143 S.Ct. at 2382 (Barrett, J., concurring) (quoting FDA \n\n32 \n \nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n159-60 (2000)). \nDistinct in a critical respect from the major-questions \ndoctrine, the no-elephants-in-mouseholes doctrine pro-\nvides that even if a question is not major in terms of eco-\nnomic or political significance, an agency still cannot use \nancillary provisions to alter \u201cfundamental details of a \nregulatory scheme.\u201d Heating, Air Conditioning & Re-\nfrigeration Distribs. Int\u2019l v. EPA, 71 F.4th 59, 67-68 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468); see \nalso Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497, 515 (2018); \nMCI Telecomms. Corp. v. AT&T Co., 512 U.S. 218, 225-\n31 (1994). This doctrine does not sound in nondelegation \nconcerns, Heating, 71 F.4th at 67-68; instead, it is partic-\nularized application of the \u201ccommonplace\u201d rule that \u201cthe \nspecific governs the general,\u201d which applies with special \nforce where \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive \nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems \nwith specific solutions,\u201d RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. \nAmalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (cleaned \nup).      \nb. It was \u201cclear that from the very beginnings of \ncommercial nuclear power,\u201d Congress \u201cwas aware of the \nabsence of a permanent waste disposal facility.\u201d NRDC \nv. NRC, 582 F.2d 166, 170 (2d Cir. 1978). But indefinite \nprivate storage was not then regarded \u201cas a feasible and \nacceptable method of disposal \u2026 of spent [nuclear] fuel.\u201d \nFla. Power & Light Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 826 \nF.2d 239, 244 (4th Cir. 1987). Instead, \u201c[g]overnment and \nindustry accepted reprocessing as the only practical \nmethod of disposing of spent fuel.\u201d Id. at 246; supra \npp. 2-3. The AEA\u2019s failure to authorize offsite storage of \nspent nuclear fuel reflects this widespread belief. \n\n33 \n \nSo, when \u201cthe private reprocessing industry col-\nlapsed\u201d in the 1970s, \u201cthe nuclear industry was con-\nfronted with an unanticipated accumulation of spent nu-\nclear fuel\u201d with no long-term plans for managing nuclear \nwaste. Idaho, 945 F.2d at 298. Congress, in turn, recog-\nnized that this \u201caccumulation\u201d\u2014which occurred decades \nafter the AEA\u2019s enactment\u2014created a \u201cnational prob-\nlem,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(2), and that \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d is a \u201cmajor subject[] of public concern,\u201d id. \n\u00a710131(a)(7). It answered that \u201cmajor\u201d question by en-\nacting the NWPA to solve \u201cthe problems of civilian radi-\noactive waste disposal.\u201d Id. \u00a710131(a)(3). \nIn the NWPA\u2014a subsequent, more specific statute \nthan the AEA\u2014Congress decided that the \u201csolution\u201d to \nthis \u201cproblem[],\u201d id., was a permanent national reposi-\ntory deep underground in Nevada, and until then, \n\u201climit[ed] temporary storage to private at-the-reactor \nstorage or at federal sites,\u201d Pet.App.29a; see supra \npp. 3-4. Yet given political sensitivities, Congress\u2019s deci-\nsion \u201chas been hotly politically contested for over a half \ncentury.\u201d Pet.App.30a. And it was not until decades after \nthe NWPA\u2019s enactment\u2014and after the Executive \nBranch made clear it would not obey Congress\u2019s direc-\ntives regarding Yucca Mountain\u2014that the Commission \npurported to issue a license like this one.  \nWhere, as here, \u201can agency claims to discover in a \nlong-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate \u2018a \nsignificant portion of the American economy,\u2019\u201d courts \n\u201ctypically greet its announcement with a measure of \nskepticism.\u201d Util. Air, 573 U.S. at 324 (quoting Brown & \nWilliamson, 529 U.S. at 159). And where, as here, Con-\ngress enacts a comprehensive scheme to address a spe-\ncific problem, agencies cannot invoke ancillary provi-\nsions of an older statute that do not mention that \n\n34 \n \nproblem to bypass Congress\u2019s scheme. To uphold this li-\ncense, the Court \u201cwould have to conclude that Congress \nnot only\u201d hid \u201ca rather large elephant in a rather obscure \nmousehole,\u201d but also \u201cburied\u201d that elephant \u201cbeneath an \nincredibly deep mound of specificity, none of which bears \nthe footprints of the beast or any indication that Con-\ngress even suspected its presence.\u201d Am. Bar Ass\u2019n v. \nFTC, 430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nB. Petitioners\u2019 theories again fall flat. \nPetitioners again press numerous counterarguments. \nNone supports reversal. \n1. Petitioners misunderstand the separation \nof powers. \na. To start, the Commission repeatedly faults Texas \n(at, e.g., 42, 45-46) for failing to identify where Congress \nprohibited it from issuing a license like ISP\u2019s. That\u2019s \nbackwards. \u201cWere courts to presume a delegation of \npower absent an express withholding of such power, \nagencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony.\u201d Atl. \nCity Elec. Co. v. FERC, 295 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see \nalso La. Pub. Serv., 476 U.S. at 374. Courts do not \u201cpre-\nsume a delegation of power merely because Congress \nhas not expressly withheld such power.\u201d Ethyl Corp. v. \nEPA, 51 F.3d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1995). \nb. Petitioners also argue that the major-questions \ndoctrine is inapt. ISP.Br.38-39; NRC.Br.48-49. But that \ndoctrine constitutes an additional reason to affirm; the \nCourt can and should reject ISP\u2019s license based on the \nAEA\u2019s and NWPA\u2019s plain language alone. See, e.g., Ne-\nbraska, 143 S.Ct. at 2375 (invoking major-questions doc-\ntrine in the alternative). In any event, the doctrine ap-\nplies if a case involves questions of \u201cvast \u2018economic and \npolitical significance.\u2019\u201d Ala. Ass\u2019n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at \n\n35 \n \n764 (quoting Util. Air, 573 U.S. at 324). ISP does not dis-\npute that this case involves such questions. Nor could it \nwhen Congress declared that what to do with spent nu-\nclear fuel is a \u201cmajor\u201d problem. 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). \nPetitioners thus must show that Congress provided the \nCommission with clear authority. Supra pp. 24-25.  \nThe Commission\u2019s insistence (at 49) that \u201cthis Court \nhas never held that the major questions doctrine is im-\nplicated whenever a case is of some importance\u201d misses \nthe mark. The issue is of far more than \u201csome im-\nportance\u201d\u2014Congress identified it as a \u201cmajor subject[] \nof public concern.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(7). Furthermore, \nthe lengths to which the Department and the Commis-\nsion have gone for decades to escape the NWPA\u2014and \nthe reasons they have gone to those lengths\u2014confirm \nthe extraordinary political significance of this issue. Re-\ngardless, \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive \nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems \nwith specific solutions,\u201d RadLAX, 566 U.S. at 645 \n(cleaned up), precluding the Commission from straining \nto circumvent that scheme.   \n2. Petitioners misread the statutes. \nPetitioners attempt to find authority by stitching to-\ngether, Frankenstein-style, various pieces of the AEA. \nThat is not how this Court reads statutes. \na. Both Petitioners\u2019 textual arguments founder at \nthe outset by writing off the NWPA as irrelevant. E.g., \nISP.Br.15, 38-40; NRC.Br.42. But statutes \u201cdealing with \nthe same subject\u201d \u201care to be interpreted together, as \nthough they were one law.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at \n252 (emphasis omitted); supra p. 30. And \u201cthe meaning \nof one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly \nwhere,\u201d as here, \u201cCongress has spoken subsequently and \nmore specifically to the topic at hand.\u201d Brown & \n\n36 \n \nWilliamson, 529 U.S. at 133; see also SCALIA & GARNER, \nsupra, at 254-55 (citing, inter alia, Stewart, 311 U.S. at \n64). Here, the NWPA clarified that spent nuclear fuel \nmay be stored in only two types of facilities. Supra \npp. 29-30.  \nThe Commission attempts (at 43-44) to brush off the \nNWPA as immaterial to its licensing authority under the \nAEA, but the only lawful interim storage for spent nu-\nclear fuel\u2014the issue here\u2014is either onsite or federal. \nSupra pp. 4, 29-30. The Commission is also wrong to rely \non a provision that \u201cma[d]e it a crime to intentionally de-\nstroy or damage \u2018any nuclear waste storage facility li-\ncensed under\u2019\u201d the AEA, NRC.Br.42 (quoting Act of \nJune 30, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-295, \u00a7204(a), 94 Stat. 787). \nBut no one disputes that storage facilities onsite are per-\nmissible; they must be. Even if Yucca Mountain were op-\nerational, waste must cool for years after being removed \nfrom a reactor before it can be safely transported\u2014\nmeaning that some form of temporary, onsite storage of \nspent nuclear fuel inheres in the use of nuclear fuel. \nNRC.Br.3. This statute thus says nothing about the rel-\nevant locational question regarding where storage will \noccur longer-term. Regardless, the phrase \u201cnuclear \nwaste\u201d encompasses several types of waste; it does not \nequal \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d And post-NWPA, this provi-\nsion refers to the onsite storage facilities or offsite fed-\neral storage facilities that the NWPA authorizes.  \nISP is also off-base (at 39-42) when it argues that the \nNWPA is irrelevant because it often gives directives or \nauthority to the Department, not the Commission. Con-\ngress, however, can address where and how to store \nspent nuclear fuel through any agency it wishes. Regard-\nless, the Commission must still issue licenses for spent \nnuclear fuel\u2014which is at issue here. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a75842; \n\n37 \n \nCounty of Rockland, 709 F.2d at 769 n.2. The cases upon \nwhich ISP relies (at 41-42) for the proposition that the \nNWPA did not repeal the AEA ignore that the Commis-\nsion never had authority to license private, offsite stor-\nage of spent nuclear fuel. Supra pp. 24-28; see infra \nPart II.B.3 (discussing those cases). But if the AEA were \nambiguous, the subsequent and more specific language \nof the NWPA would govern. See Brown & Williamson, \n529 U.S. at 133. \nISP also gets the NWPA wrong when it argues (at 42) \nthat the NWPA \u201cwas all about permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel by [the Department], not temporary \npossession of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.\u201d Put-\nting aside that no one can claim with a straight face that \nthis license is really a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure, ISP\u2019s argu-\nment fails because the NWPA expressly addresses in-\nterim storage. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a710151-57.  \nISP faults (at 39-40) the Fifth Circuit for \u201cinvok[ing]\u201d \nNWPA provisions and insists (at 40) that \u00a710155(h) \n\u201cmerely limits\u201d the NWPA\u2019s \u201cscope\u201d with no effect on \nthe AEA. But the Commission issued ISP\u2019s license under \nrules that \u201cappl[y] only to \u2018temporary storage,\u2019 which the \nagency defined as \u2018interim storage.\u2019\u201d NRC.Br.4 (quoting \n45 Fed. Reg. at 74,694); see Pet.App.53a. That is the pre-\ncise issue that the NWPA governs. ISP thus ignores the \nin pari materia canon and Congress\u2019s specific limits on \nstorage options for spent nuclear fuel.    \nb. Petitioners also attempt to ground the Commis-\nsion\u2019s authority in the AEA\u2019s general purpose state-\nments and findings. E.g., ISP.Br.29-31 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a72011-12). But although \u201cstatements of purpose\u201d may \nhelp clarify ambiguities, \u201cby their nature,\u201d they \u201ccannot \noverride a statute\u2019s operative language.\u201d Sturgeon v. \nFrost, 587 U.S. 28, 57 (2019) (cleaned up).   \n\n38 \n \nEven if ISP could avoid this conclusion by calling pol-\nicy statements \u201cdelegations,\u201d ISP.Br.31-32 (citing \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72011(b))\u2014and it cannot\u2014it would fare no bet-\nter. The cited statement provides that \u201cthe development, \nuse, and control of atomic energy shall be directed so as \nto promote world peace, improve the general welfare, in-\ncrease the standard of living, and strengthen free com-\npetition in private enterprise.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72011(b). If that \nwere a delegation of regulatory authority, it would be un-\nconstitutional, for it is hard to imagine less of an intelli-\ngible principle. As a policy statement, however, it cannot \nanswer the question here because \u201cno legislation pursues \nits purposes at all costs.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, 480 \nU.S. 522, 525-26 (1987) (per curiam). Instead, the AEA\u2019s \nand NWPA\u2019s specific operative terms control.  \nc. Petitioners also argue that because the AEA per-\nmits the Commission to license possession of \u201cspecial nu-\nclear material,\u201d \u201csource material,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct mate-\nrial,\u201d it may issue licenses regarding \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d \non the theory that spent nuclear fuel \u201cis composed of\u201d \nspecial nuclear material, source material, and byproduct \nmaterial. ISP.Br.29-32; NRC.Br.32-35. That is like say-\ning that because the Federal Aviation Administration \nmay regulate hydrogen-fueled aircraft and oxygen \nequipment on planes, it also may license water. Regard-\nless, the Commission does not have a general power to \nlicense possession of such materials\u2014it may do so only \nfor specified purposes, none of which is storage. Supra \npp. 26-28. \n\u201cIn a given statute,\u201d especially one like the AEA that \ninvolves \u201cterms with some heft and distinctiveness,\u201d the \n\u201csame term usually has the same meaning[,] and differ-\nent terms usually have different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Courts thus \n\n39 \n \npresume that \u201c\u2018Congress\u2019[s] choice of words is \u2026 delib-\nerate\u2019 and deserving of judicial respect.\u201d SAS Inst., Inc. \nv. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 364 (2018). \u201c[D]efined meanings\u201d \nthus cannot \u201cbe replaced with another\u201d potentially \u201cper-\nmissible meaning of the word\u201d\u2014\u201cthe definition is virtu-\nally conclusive.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 228.  \nHere, Congress demonstrated that \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel\u201d\u2014a defined term\u2014constitutes more than the sum of \nits parts. After all, the AEA lists \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d as \na separate, independent item from \u201cbyproduct materials, \nsource materials,\u201d and \u201cspecial nuclear materials.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72210i(b). Yet none of the licensing provisions \nof the AEA references \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d \u201cCongress \ngenerally acts intentionally when it uses particular lan-\nguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another.\u201d \nDHS v. MacLean, 574 U.S. 383, 391 (2015). Further-\nmore, \u201c\u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 means fuel that has been with-\ndrawn from a nuclear reactor following irradiation, the \nconstituent elements of which have not been separated \nby reprocessing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a710101(23) (emphasis \nadded). The Commission cannot break down \u201cspent nu-\nclear fuel\u201d into its constituent parts. \nIn fact, the Commission\u2019s own rules preclude such \nparsing. \u201c[S]pent nuclear fuel\u201d \u201cincludes the special nu-\nclear material, byproduct material, source material, and \nother radioactive materials associated with fuel assem-\nblies.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a772.3 (emphasis added). Even the Com-\nmission thus recognizes that \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d is more \nthan the sum of \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource ma-\nterial,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d Id. And nothing in the \nAEA authorizes licensing offsite storage of those \u201cother \nradioactive materials.\u201d Id.  \nd. ISP fares no better (at 30-32) by repeating the \nwords \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b). The \n\n40 \n \nCommission may \u201cissue licenses to \u2026 possess \u2026 special \nnuclear material.\u201d Id. \u00a72073(a) (emphasis added). And \n\u201c[n]o person may \u2026 possess \u2026 any byproduct material\u201d \nunless the Commission issues a license for the specific \nenumerated purposes. Id. \u00a72111(a) (emphasis added). \nBut the Commission cannot license possession of spent \nnuclear fuel at all or any material other than for an enu-\nmerated purpose. Supra pp. 24-28.   \ne. Petitioners fall back on the AEA\u2019s catchall provi-\nsions. ISP.Br.30-31, 34-36; NRC.Br.33-35; see also Hol-\ntec.Br.16-18. Not only do none of these provisions refer \nto \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014itself dispositive\u2014but courts \n\u201cinterpret a \u2018general or collective term\u2019 at the end of a \nlist of specific items in light of any \u2018common attribute[s]\u2019\u201d \nthe \u201cspecific items\u201d share. Sw. Airlines, 596 U.S. at 458. \nThe \u201ccommon attribute\u201d that the \u201cspecific items\u201d in \n\u00a7\u00a72073(a), 2093(a), and 2111(a) share are active, affirma-\ntive uses of the same type as the enumerated activities. \nSupra pp. 26-28. Storage is different.  \nIf the Commission could deem any \u201cuse[]\u201d an \u201cappro-\npriate\u201d one (or \u201capprove[]\u201d such a use) to carry out the \nAEA\u2019s purposes, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073(a)(4), 2093(a)(4), the \ncatchall provisions would swallow the specifically enu-\nmerated terms, rendering them meaningless. See \nFischer, 603 U.S. at 487-88. And if the Commission can \nlicense private offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel \nmerely because it would help the Commission regulate \n\u201csource materials,\u201d NRC.Br.34 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a72093(a)(4)), then entire provisions of the AEA would be \nsuperfluous because the Commission could make the \nsame argument with respect to \u201cbyproduct material\u201d and \n\u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d\u2014both of which have their own \nlicensing provisions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72073, 2111. \n\n41 \n \nISP asserts (at 35) that ejusdem generis is inapt be-\ncause it \u201crequires a \u2018long and detailed list of specific di-\nrections,\u2019 with a common \u2018link.\u2019\u201d But the Court did not \n\u201crequire[]\u201d a \u201clong and detailed list of specific directions\u201d \nin Harrington v. Purdue Pharma LP, 603 U.S. 204, 217 \n(2024). Rather, the Court noted that the Bankruptcy \nCode contains such lists, while making clear that the \nsame rule applies to \u201ca list discussing \u2018cars, trucks, mo-\ntorcycles, or any other vehicles.\u2019\u201d Id.; e.g., Fischer, 603 \nU.S. at 487-88. Only two specific terms need precede the \ngeneral one. See SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 206. Nor \nneed the statute expressly state a \u201clink\u201d between the \nlisted items\u2014the list itself is the link. Harrington, 603 \nU.S. at 218. Contra ISP.Br.35.  \nISP also insists (at 36) that ejusdem generis cannot \napply because the general terms here do not count as \ncatchall terms. But even the Commission refers to them \n(at 33) as \u201ccatchall\u201d language. And ISP\u2019s notion (at 36) \nthat these provisions \u201censure that the agency can fully \nimplement the congressionally defined purposes of the \nAEA\u201d is just another version of its view that policy state-\nments are \u201clatent well[s] of authority.\u201d Kentucky v. \nBiden, 23 F.4th 585, 606 (6th Cir. 2022) (rejecting a sim-\nilar theory based on Sturgeon).  \nFor its part, rather than contending that ejusdem \ngeneris does not apply, the Commission argues (at 33-34) \nthat because it has licensed reactors under \u00a7\u00a72133 and \n2134\u2014which \u00a72073(a)(2) and (3) reference\u2014it may also \nlicense possession of \u201cspent fuel stored in a spent-fuel \nstorage installation\u201d under \u00a72073(a)(4)\u2019s catchall provi-\nsion because spent fuel \u201cresults from the activities refer-\nenced in\u201d \u00a72073(a)(2) and (3). But \u00a72073(a) authorizes the \nCommission to license only \u201cspecial nuclear material\u201d\u2014\nnot \u201cbyproduct material\u201d or \u201csource material,\u201d and \n\n42 \n \ncertainly not \u201cspent nuclear fuel.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72073(a) \n(emphasis added). Regardless, just because spent fuel \n\u201cresults from\u201d certain activities, NRC.Br.34, it hardly \nfollows that it is like those activities in the relevant ways. \nSewage is not food merely because it results from eating. \n\u201cWhen general words\u201d like \u00a72073(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cfollow an enu-\nmeration of two or more things, they apply only to \u2026 \nthings of the same general kind or class specifically men-\ntioned.\u201d SCALIA & GARNER, supra, at 199.  \nThe Commission also errs when it argues (at 32, 34) \nthat it may license storage of special nuclear material \nand source material because storage may be a practical \nnecessity. No one disputes that storage is necessary\u2014\nthe question, though, is where? Congress made onsite \nstorage the default option for temporary storage. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710151(a)(1). The only exception is for federal \nrepositories. Nor do the phrases \u201cfor such other uses as \nthe Commission determines to be appropriate,\u201d id. \n\u00a72073(a)(4), or \u201cany other use approved by the Commis-\nsion as an aid to science or industry,\u201d id. \u00a72093(a)(4), au-\nthorize the Commission to use its \u201cexpertise\u201d to go be-\nyond the class of items Congress enacted. Contra \nNRC.Br.34, 48. Such arguments would not have worked \nunder Chevron, let alone today. \nThe Commission fares no better with \u201cbyproduct ma-\nterial.\u201d NRC.Br.35. Ejusdem generis plainly applies to \nthe catchall language \u201cor such other useful applications \nas may be developed.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72111(a). And the Com-\nmission cannot rest its supposed authority to license \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014a different material\u2014on its au-\nthority to license possession of \u201cbyproduct material\u201d for \ncertain uses. Contra ISP.Br.31; NRC.Br.35, 41. \nf. Finally, ISP relies (at 29-30) on a grant of rule-\nmaking power. That provision \u201cauthorize[s]\u201d the \n\n43 \n \nCommission to \u201cestablish \u2026 standards and instructions \nto govern the possession and use of special nuclear ma-\nterial, source material, and byproduct material \u2026 to pro-\nmote the common defense and security or to protect \nhealth or to minimize danger to life or property.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a72201(b). But \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d is not \u201cspe-\ncial nuclear material, source material, and byproduct \nmaterial,\u201d and even if it were, ISP\u2019s license is not for de-\nfense or safety purposes. Because administrative law has \nno \u201cadverse possession\u201d rule \u201cinsulat[ing]\u201d an agency\u2019s \n\u201cdisregard of statutory text,\u201d Rapanos v. United States, \n547 U.S. 715, 752 (2006), agency rules and practices can-\nnot confer authority that Congress never granted. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 invocations of 10 C.F.R. Part 72 thus fail. \nNor did the NWPA\u2019s enactment effectively ratify \nthose regulations. Contra, e.g., ISP.Br.40-41. 10 C.F.R. \nPart 72 had been \u201con the books,\u201d ISP.Br.4, 17, 32, 40, for \na scant two years when Congress enacted the NWPA, see \nNRC.Br.43, and so was hardly settled. If anything, the \nNWPA\u2019s enactment vitiated those regulations (if they, \nindeed, mean what Petitioners claim), as Congress con-\ncluded that prior efforts to solve \u201cthe problems of civilian \nradioactive waste disposal ha[d] not been adequate,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a710131(a)(3), and permitted two, and only two, \ntypes of interim storage, neither of which applies here.     \n3. Petitioners cite inapposite cases. \nPetitioners also repeatedly invoke a handful of \nlower-court cases, none of which support this license.  \na. Petitioners\u2019 primary case is Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 \nF.3d 536 (D.C. Cir. 2004), which ISP\u2019s other main case, \nSkull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 \nF.3d 1223 (10th Cir. 2004), follows, id. at 1249-50. True, \nin Bullcreek, the D.C. Circuit stated that \u201c[w]hile the \nAEA does not specifically refer to the storage or disposal \n\n44 \n \nof spent nuclear fuel, it has long been recognized that the \nAEA confers on the [Commission] authority to license \nand regulate the storage and disposal of such fuel.\u201d 359 \nF.3d at 538. But that statement is pure ipse dixit, with \nno analysis of the statutory language. Id. at 538, 542-43. \nAnd the three cases the court cited addressed preemp-\ntion of state law; none show that the Commission may \n\u201clicense and regulate the storage and disposal of\u201d spent \nnuclear fuel. Id. at 538. \nBullcreek relied on only one decision from this Court: \nPacific Gas and Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources \nConservation and Development Commission, 461 U.S. \n190 (1983). But that case concerned power-plant con-\nstruction and said only that the AEA empowers the \nCommission to \u201clicense the transfer, delivery, receipt, \nacquisition, possession[,] and use of nuclear materials\u201d \ngenerally\u2014not spent nuclear fuel. Id. at 207. Relying on \nstatutes addressing \u201cspecial nuclear material,\u201d \u201csource \nmaterial,\u201d and \u201cbyproduct material,\u201d see id., the Court \naddressed \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d only in connection with \nonsite storage and disposal, e.g., id. at 195. Whether the \nCommission could similarly regulate offsite storage was \nnot at issue. \nIllinois v. General Electric Co., 683 F.2d 206 (7th Cir. \n1982), is equally inapt. Illinois did not \u201cquestion the Com-\nmission\u2019s authority to regulate the storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel,\u201d id. at 215, unlike Respondents here. And in \nobserving that Illinois \u201ccould not\u201d have questioned that \nsupposed authority, the court did not analyze the stat-\nutes it cited: \u00a7\u00a72073 and 2111. Id. at 214-15. Neither em-\npowers the Commission to license offsite possession of \nspent nuclear fuel for storage purposes. Supra pp. 24-28.  \nJersey Central Power & Light Co. v. Township of \nLacey, 772 F.2d 1103 (3d Cir. 1985), has no relevant \n\n45 \n \nstatutory analysis, id. at 1111-12. Instead, the court re-\nlied on regulations to aver that the Commission had \u201cli-\ncensing and regulatory authority with respect to \u2026 the \n\u2018transfer, storage[,] or disposal of radioactive waste mat-\nter resulting from the separation in a production facility \nof special nuclear material from unradiated nuclear re-\nactor fuel.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1111 (citation omitted); see also id. at \n1112. Such \u201cradioactive waste matter\u201d is not spent nu-\nclear fuel. Compare id. at 1111, with 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a72014(ee), 10101(23). In all events, statutes trump reg-\nulations. \nb. Notwithstanding its shaky footing, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit has claimed that Bullcreek \u201cheld that the AEA pro-\nvided \u2018the [Commission] authority to license and regulate \nthe storage and disposal of [spent nuclear] fuel.\u2019\u201d Beyond \nNuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 538). But as the Commis-\nsion admitted at oral argument below, the Commission\u2019s \nAEA authority \u201cwasn\u2019t even specifically challenged\u201d in \nBullcreek. Oral Argument at 30:56-31:02, Texas v. NRC, \n78 F.4th 827 (5th Cir. 2023) (No. 21-60743), https://www.\nca5.uscourts.gov/OralArgRecordings/21/21-60743\u2014_8-\n29-2022.mp3; see Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 541. Contra \nISP.Br.33. Nor was it at issue in the cases Bullcreek \ncited. See Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 207; Jersey Cent., \n772 F.2d at 1111-12; Gen. Elec., 683 F.2d at 215. \nISP counters (at 33) that if \u201cany legitimate doubt\u201d ex-\nisted regarding the Commission\u2019s \u201cauthority under the \nAEA \u2026 , such doubts would have been aired in those pro-\nceedings, rather than conceded.\u201d But the Commission \ndoes not echo ISP\u2019s position\u2014which ignores party \npresentation. E.g., United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 \nU.S. 371, 375-76 (2020). Regardless, the Court is bound \nby what Congress wrote, not D.C. Circuit precedent. See, \n\n46 \n \ne.g., Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n. v. Becerra, 596 U.S. 724, 739 \n(2022).   \n4. Petitioners cite irrelevant examples. \nFinally, ISP claims (at 32) that \u201c[t]here are at least a \ndozen existing sites in the country where there is no op-\nerating reactor and where spent nuclear fuel is stored, at \nleast seven of which are privately owned.\u201d The key word \nthere is \u201coperating\u201d; each storage facility was built on \nthe site of a reactor that was operating at the time. That \nis different in kind from what ISP proposes and confirms \nthat reactors should store their own spent nuclear fuel \nuntil a permanent repository is built. As noted above, the \nAEA permits onsite storage of spent fuel because some \namount of storage is inherent in the license of use. Supra \np. 36. By contrast, even if the AEA contemplated trans-\nportation of spent nuclear fuel offsite (which is debata-\nble), the new location would need a separate license, \nwhich Congress has nowhere authorized. Petitioners\u2019 \ncontrary argument, e.g., NRC.Br.40; ISP.Br.36-37, is \nthus a red herring.  \nFor its part, the Commission also insists (at 38) that \nit \u201chas consistently understood the [AEA] to authorize it \nto license the offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel.\u201d \nWhatever that \u201cunderstanding\u201d has been, it cannot con-\ntravene clear statutory text. See, e.g., Rapanos, 547 U.S. \nat 752. And the Commission\u2019s examples of its \u201cunder-\nstanding\u201d are underwhelming. When the Atomic Safety \nand Licensing Board wrote that \u201cspent nuclear fuel \u2026 \ncould be \u2018stor[ed] in offsite facilities,\u2019\u201d NRC.Br.38 (quot-\ning In re Kan. Gas & Elec. Co., 5 N.R.C. 301, 321 (1977)), \nit referred to three such facilities, see In re Kan. Gas, 5 \nN.R.C. at 320-21. One was G.E. Morris, discussed below; \nanother, in West Valley, New York, was quickly shut \ndown. Id. at 320-21; see Jersey Cent., 772 F.2d at 1105. \n\n47 \n \nThe third, in Barnwell, South Carolina, never operated. \nSee In re Kan. Gas, 5 N.R.C. at 320-21. The Commission \nhas apparently not licensed an operating spent-nu-\nclear-fuel storage facility since the collapse of the repro-\ncessing industry or enactment of the NWPA. \nNonetheless, the Commission represents (at 6) that \nit has \u201cissued four licenses authorizing private parties to \ntemporarily store spent fuel at sites where no nuclear re-\nactor has ever been located.\u201d That claim is misleading. \nTwo are either the subject of this case or of related liti-\ngation now pending before this Court. The third, Private \nFuel Storage, was issued decades after the NWPA\u2019s en-\nactment and was the subject of Bullcreek. Notably, that \nfacility was never built. J.A.302.  \nThat leaves only G.E. Morris, NRC.Br.6, which sup-\nports Texas. Licensed in 1967 as a reprocessing facility, \nthat facility was converted to storage in 1971\u2014before the \nNPWA confirmed Congress\u2019s position that such facilities \nare not allowed. In re Gen. Elec. Co., 22 N.R.C. 851 \n(1985); Illinois v. NRC, 591 F.2d 12, 13 n.1 (7th Cir. \n1979). At the time, this site was the \u201conly away-from-site \nfacility\u201d in the entire country that \u201caccept[ed] spent nu-\nclear fuel for storage,\u201d Gen. Elec., 683 F.2d at 208, and \nmuch of the fuel at that facility was already onsite, see S. \nCal. Edison Co. v. United States, 93 Fed. Cl. 337, 344 \n(Fed. Cl. 2010). Given that controversy about G.E. Mor-\nris likely explains Congress\u2019s prohibition on \u201cen-\ncourag[ing]\u201d parties to use such offsite storage, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a710155(h), it can hardly be said to support Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position that they could abandon Yucca Moun-\ntain.  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nOFFICE OF THE  \n  ATTORNEY GENERAL \nP.O.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal reasoning step, a meta-analysis of my current knowledge and a plan for future information gathering. It did not introduce new facts, arguments, or evidence about the case itself. Instead, it served to confirm and summarize the detailed understanding I had already built from the petitioner's brief.\n\nTherefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, as no new information has been presented to alter them. My current understanding, which this observation reinforces, is as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):**\n    *   **Petitioner's Stance:** The core of the petitioner's argument is that the Hobbs Act's \"party aggrieved\" language (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344) is a strict, non-waivable jurisdictional requirement. Texas, by choosing not to participate in the NRC's administrative process, forfeited its status as a \"party\" and thus its right to judicial review.\n    *   **Judicial Philosophy Signal:** The petitioners directly challenge the Fifth Circuit's creation of an \"ultra vires\" exception, framing it as judicial overreach that circumvents clear statutory text. This argument is designed to appeal to textualist and originalist methodologies on the Court.\n    *   **Key Signal (Circuit Split):** The conflict with the Tenth Circuit's decision in *State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC* remains a powerful signal. The Supreme Court often takes cases to resolve such splits, and the existence of a conflicting precedent strengthens the case for reversal.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):**\n    *   **AEA as the Foundation:** My belief is that the petitioners' case rests on the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) providing a broad, independent grant of authority to the NRC to license the \"possession and use\" of nuclear materials. They argue this authority is not new but has been consistently exercised for decades, as evidenced by regulations for independent storage facilities (10 C.F.R. pt. 72) dating back to 1980.\n    *   **NWPA as a Specific, Non-Exclusive Solution:** The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) is framed not as a limitation on the AEA, but as a separate statute addressing a different problem: the creation of a *permanent federal repository*. Petitioners argue the NWPA did not implicitly repeal the NRC's pre-existing authority to license *temporary private storage*, especially given the federal government's failure to deliver on the Yucca Mountain repository.\n    *   **Key Signal (Judicial Consensus):** The petitioners have successfully painted the Fifth Circuit's decision as an outlier not just in relation to the Tenth Circuit on procedure, but also in relation to the D.C. Circuit and others (*Don\u2019t Waste Michigan*, *Bullcreek*, *Skull Valley*) on the substantive question of NRC authority. This narrative of a stable consensus being disrupted is a compelling argument for reversal.\n\nIn essence, my belief state is unchanged but solidified. The petitioners have constructed a multi-faceted case built on statutory text, historical agency practice, and a pattern of favorable judicial precedents from other circuits. The observation confirms that the next critical piece of information required to challenge this understanding is the respondent's (Texas's) brief, which will provide the counterarguments to this well-defined narrative. My uncertainty is now focused entirely on the strength and nature of those forthcoming counterarguments.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case, previously shaped solely by the petitioners' arguments, has now been significantly updated and complicated by the introduction of the respondents' (Texas's) brief. The counterarguments presented by Texas directly challenge the core premises of the petitioners' case on both the procedural and substantive questions.\n\nMy beliefs, which now integrate both sides of the argument, are as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My prior belief was that the petitioners had a strong textualist argument that Texas, as a non-participant in the NRC's administrative process, was not a \"party aggrieved\" and thus lacked standing. This belief is now contested by several new arguments from Texas:\n    *   **Factual Counter-Claim:** Texas asserts that it *did* participate in the agency proceedings by lodging objections to the license, thereby qualifying as a \"party aggrieved\" under a plain reading of the term. This introduces a factual dispute that complicates the petitioners' clean narrative.\n    *   **Separation of Powers Argument:** Texas argues that an agency (the NRC) cannot use its own procedural rules to limit the jurisdictional grant given to federal courts by Congress in the Hobbs Act. Citing precedents like *Kucana v. Holder*, Texas frames this as an issue of agency overreach, arguing for a strong presumption of judicial review that cannot be easily stripped away by agency regulation. This shifts the focus from a simple definition of \"party\" to a broader question of judicial authority.\n    *   **Defense of the *Ultra Vires* Exception:** Texas defends the Fifth Circuit's alternative holding, arguing that courts have inherent power to review and enjoin agency actions that are taken completely outside of their statutory authority (*ultra vires*), citing foundational cases like *Leedom v. Kyne*.\n    *   **Updated Belief:** The procedural question is no longer a straightforward textual issue. It is now a three-pronged debate involving factual participation, the limits of agency power to define judicial jurisdiction, and the validity of the *ultra vires* exception. My confidence in the petitioners' position on this question has decreased, as Texas has provided plausible, well-supported counterarguments that appeal to judicial authority and the presumption of reviewability.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My previous understanding was that the petitioners made a compelling case based on the AEA's broad grant of authority and the NWPA's limited scope. Texas has mounted a formidable challenge to this view.\n    *   **AEA as a Limited Grant:** Texas counters the petitioners' narrative by arguing the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) does not provide a blanket authorization. Instead, they conduct a close reading of specific sections (\u00a72073, \u00a72093, \u00a72111), arguing that none explicitly authorize licensing *private, away-from-reactor* storage. They contend the NRC is impermissibly stitching together unrelated provisions to invent a power Congress never granted.\n    *   **NWPA as an Exclusive Scheme:** This is a critical new belief. Where the petitioners see the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) as a non-exclusive solution for a permanent repository, Texas argues it is a **comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme** for all spent fuel disposal. Texas points out that Congress meticulously detailed a plan for a permanent repository (Yucca Mountain) and for *federally-owned* temporary storage, but deliberately omitted any mention of *private* temporary storage. This makes a powerful structural argument that Congress considered and rejected the very scheme the NRC has now licensed.\n    *   **Introduction of the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** This is the most significant new signal from the observation. Texas explicitly invokes the MQD, citing recent, landmark Supreme Court decisions like *West Virginia v. EPA* and *Biden v. Nebraska*. They argue that authorizing a private company to create a de facto permanent nuclear waste site\u2014a matter of vast economic and political significance, especially over a state's explicit opposition\u2014requires a clear and unambiguous statement from Congress. They assert that no such clear authorization exists in either the AEA or the NWPA. This argument is highly resonant with the current Court's jurisprudence and provides a powerful, independent basis for affirming the Fifth Circuit.\n    *   **Dismantling the \"Judicial Consensus\":** Texas directly attacks the petitioners' claim that the Fifth Circuit is an outlier. They argue that prior cases from other circuits (*Skull Valley*, *Bullcreek*) are \"inapposite\" because they did not fully grapple with the NWPA's exclusive structure or were decided before the maturation of the Major Questions Doctrine. This new argument weakens the petitioners' narrative of a stable, disrupted consensus.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has shifted significantly. The petitioners' case, which once appeared strong, now seems to be based on a broad, purposive reading of older statutes that is vulnerable to the current Court's textualist and structuralist methodologies. Texas has successfully introduced powerful counterarguments, most notably the Major Questions Doctrine, which aligns perfectly with recent trends in the Court's administrative law jurisprudence. My confidence has now shifted to favor the respondents (Texas), as their arguments appear better tailored to the legal doctrines currently favored by a majority of the justices. My uncertainty now centers on how the petitioners will rebut the MQD argument and defend their interpretation of the NWPA in their reply brief and at oral argument.",

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  Respondents \nhave no substantive response, but instead just com-\nplain that such a critique is \u201chyperbole.\u201d  Fasken Br. \n47; Texas Br. 23.  It\u2019s not\u2014it is spot on. \nFinally with regard to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra \nvires doctrine, respondents give short shrift to the du-\nbious origins of that doctrine even in the Fifth Circuit \nitself, as well as to the compelling weight of uniform \ncontrary authority.  See ISP Br. 20-22; NRC Br. 23-25. \nThose factors and authorities further confirm that the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s stated basis for hearing the petitions of \nTexas and Fasken was error. \nIII. The Atomic Energy Act Authorizes the NRC \nto License the Temporary Storage of Spent \nNuclear Fuel Away from a Reactor Site \nA. The Atomic Energy Act\u2019s provisions re-\ngarding the constituent radioactive ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel authorize the \nNRC to regulate spent nuclear fuel. \nIn its decision, the Fifth Circuit accepted the oft-\nrecited (and accurate) proposition that \u201c[s]pecial nu-\nclear material, source material, and byproduct mate-\nrial are constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,\u201d \nand then proceeded to base its statutory analysis upon \nAEA provisions addressing those constituent materi-\nals.  ISP App. 22a (citing Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 F.3d \n536, 538 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Respondents, however, \n\n11 \nhave decided to take a different tack: their AEA argu-\nments now are largely based on the fact that the term \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d was not separately defined in the \noriginal AEA, but was instead added in 1988 as part of \nan unrelated overhaul of the Price Anderson Act.  \nFasken Br. 24 (\u201cIndeed, Congress did not amend the \nAEA to add \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 as a defined term until \n1988.\u201d (citing Price Anderson Amendments Act \u00a7 4(b), \n102 Stat. 1069)); Texas Br. 25-26.5\nRespondents\u2019 arguments run headlong into Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & \nDev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983).  That case was all \nabout \u201cspent fuel,\u201d id. at 194, and, more particularly, \nthe metes and bounds of how much Congress had oc-\ncupied the field regarding the storage of spent fuel in \nthe AEA, for preemption purposes.  The Court based \nits decision on its analysis of the then-current version \nof the AEA, including the provisions regarding the con-\nstituent elements of spent fuel.  Id. at 207.  The Court \nalso highlighted that \u201cthe NRC has promulgated de-\ntailed regulations governing storage and disposal \naway from the reactor.\u201d  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 217 \n5 Fasken makes much of the fact that a subsequent regu-\nlatory definition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d includes \u201cother radioac-\ntive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d Fasken Br. 26-27 \n(emphasis omitted) (citing Final Rule, Licensing Requirements \nfor the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Stor-\nage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,700-01 (Nov. 12, 1980); \n10 C.F.R. 72.3).  That reference merely recognizes the existence \nof control rod elements and the like\u2014the packaging that holds a \nnuclear fuel assembly together\u2014which become irradiated with \nuse.  See, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 961.11, Appendix E, Section B.2.  More-\nover, materials \u201cmade radioactive by exposure to the radiation in-\ncident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d are, in fact, \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(1). \n\n12 \n(citing 10 C.F.R. Part 72).  The addition of a separate \ndefinition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d on which respond-\nents now place such heavy reliance, had not yet oc-\ncurred\u2014that was still some five years into the future.  \nAnd the recently enacted Nuclear Waste Policy Act did \nnot affect the preemption analysis.  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. \nat 219.   \nWhile the Court ultimately held that the chal-\nlenged state statute addressed economic matters re-\nserved to the states and was therefore not preempted, \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning offered definitive guidance on \nthe scope of the AEA.  The Court made clear that Con-\ngress had \u201coccupied the entire field of nuclear safety \nconcerns,\u201d and the NRC, given the already-existing \nstatutory and regulatory landscape under the AEA, \nhad exercised its authority \u201cto authorize the storage of \nspent fuel.\u201d  461 U.S. at 212, 218.  Indeed, a key prem-\nise of the Court\u2019s holding was that although the federal \ngovernment was responsible to develop and license \ntechnology for \u201cnuclear waste disposal,\u201d the state stat-\nute had not attempted \u201cto enter this field  * * *  occu-\npied by the federal government.\u201d  Id. at 219.  The main \narguments propounded by respondents regarding the \nAEA in this case, therefore, cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas.6\n6 Texas posits an analogy about erroneously concluding \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration can regulate water, be-\ncause it can regulate hydrogen-fueled planes with oxygen equip-\nment.  Texas Br. 38.  That misses the mark.  The more apt anal-\nogy would be one section of a statute criminalizing the possession \nof heroin, and another the possession of cocaine.  No one could \nseriously argue that merely mixing the two drugs together takes \none completely outside of the law.  Yet, that is the essential posi-\ntion of respondents here. \n\n13 \nB. Respondents are unable to proffer any \nplausible interpretation of statutory text \nto support what they say the law is. \nRespondents\u2019 definitional arguments reveal an-\nother fundamental flaw in their efforts to defend the \nresult of the Fifth Circuit: there is no sensible inter-\npretation of the statutes that leads to what respond-\nents contend the law to be.  Texas asserts that the \nNRC \u201ccannot license possession of spent nuclear fuel at \nall.\u201d  Texas Br. 40.  Similarly, Fasken asserts that \u201c[n]o \nAEA provision grants NRC express authority to issue \na license for storing spent fuel.\u201d  Fasken Br. 24.  But, \nat the same time, Texas admits that \u201cno one disputes \nthat storage facilities onsite are permissible; they \nmust be.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  Well, what statutory provi-\nsion provides that \u201cpermission\u201d?  Respondents do not \nsay. \nThe necessary flipside of respondents\u2019 arguments \nalso reveals their error.  If, as respondents contend, \nthe provisions of the AEA addressing the constituent \ncomponents do not authorize the NRC to issue a li-\ncense for the possession and storage of \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d then the AEA also cannot prohibit the possession \nand storage of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014you cannot have \none without the other.7  We would be in a state of na-\nture: the unavoidable implication of respondents\u2019 ar-\nguments is that ISP did not even need a license from \nthe NRC, and could have just constructed the facility \non its own.  It is hard to imagine a scenario more inim-\nical to what Congress expressly identified as the core \n7 The prohibitions upon possession without a license are \nat 42 U.S.C. 2077(a) (special nuclear material), 2092 (source ma-\nterial) and 2111(a) (byproduct material). \n\n14 \npurposes of the AEA.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), (b); \n2012(a); 2013(d).  The statute should be interpreted in \na manner that harmonizes those provisions, not cre-\nates such elemental conflicts.  E.g., Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts (\u201cReading Law\u201d) 181-182 (2012). \nC. Respondents\u2019 ejusdem generis-type inter-\npretations of the AEA are erroneous. \nNeither respondent tries to defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretive analysis of the AEA.  The court be-\nlow held that the only permissible licenses with re-\nspect to special nuclear and source material were for \n\u201ccertain types of research and development,\u201d ISP App. \n22a, based upon 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(1) and (2) and \n2093(a)(1) and (2).  The Fifth Circuit inexplicably \nfailed to account for subsection (a)(3) of both statutory \nsections, and failed to give any meaning to subsection \n(a)(4).  And with regard to byproduct material, the \nFifth Circuit misconstrued an inapplicable provision \n(42 U.S.C. 2111(b)) based upon internet-derived con-\nclusions involving not byproduct, but special nuclear, \nmaterial.  ISP App. 23a; see ISP Br. 37. \nRespondents, however, do try to construct post-hoc\nejusdem generis-type defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s re-\nsult, at least with respect to special nuclear and source \nmaterial. Fasken Br. 29-31; Texas Br. 26-28, 40-43.  \nThose efforts fail.   \nFirst, respondents cannot identify a supportable \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d that fits their needs.  That, alone, \nprecludes the ejusdem generis-type arguments of re-\nspondents.  E.g., Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. \n214, 225 (2008); Reading Law 209 (\u201c\u2018the enumeration \nof the specific items is so heterogeneous as to disclose \n\n15 \nno common genus.\u2019 With this type of wording, the \ncanon does not apply.\u201d (quoting Lord Macmillan, Law \nand Other Things 166 (1938)).  The specifically enu-\nmerated potential uses here include research and de-\nvelopment related to atomic energy ((2073(a)(1), \n2093(a)(1)), research or development related to medi-\ncal therapy or medical therapy itself ((2073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2)), and for \u201cuse in a license\u201d for certain isotope \nproduction facilities, and in nuclear power plants.  42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3).  Respondents have come \nup with an argued common attribute of \u201cproductive \nuse,\u201d which they say excludes temporary storage of the \nmaterials, even at reactor sites.  Fasken Br. 30; Texas \nBr. 28.  That, however, is a made-up restriction with-\nout any textual, historical, or other support, and is fur-\nther belied by the admission that \u201csome form of tem-\nporary, onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel inheres in \nthe use of nuclear fuel.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  If there is any \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d here (and ISP does not agree that \nthere is), the fact that the enumerated items include \nnuclear power plants would mean that regulation of \nradioactive materials that \u201cinhere\u201d to operation of \nsuch plants would fit comfortably within any reasona-\nble postulated commonality. \nSecond, whether or not one labels Sections \n2073(a)(4) and 2093(a)(4) as \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions, \nthose terms indisputably have to be given some mean-\ning.  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 596, 607-608 (2010); \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  Respondents\u2019 con-\nstructs fail to do so, and the better interpretation is to \nconclude that the provisions encompass the licensing \nof temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel at away-\nfrom-reactors sites.   \n\n16 \nIt is also important to give meaning to what Con-\ngress actually said about the duties of the NRC, which \nis that it was required to \u201cestablish by rule, regulation, \nor order, such standards and instructions to govern the \npossession and use of special nuclear material, source \nmaterial, and byproduct material, as the Commission \nmay deem necessary or desirable to promote the com-\nmon defense and security or to protect health or to \nminimize danger to life or property,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), consistent with the \u201cdevelopment, use, and \ncontrol of atomic energy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a),8 and \nwithout any locational limitation.  The restrictive con-\ntentions of respondents are irreconcilable with Con-\ngress\u2019s clear commands. \nIn short, respondents cannot defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s construction of the AEA, nor reconcile their ar-\nguments with Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 217, nor defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from Bullcreek, 359 F.3d \nat 541, and Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. \nNielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. 2004).  See \nalso, Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 964 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Which is perhaps why they have, \nnow, pivoted to relying primarily upon the NWPA for \ntheir merits-based arguments. \n8 These provisions are not, as Texas claims, mere empty \n\u201cpolicy statements\u201d that can be ignored for these purposes. Texas \nBr. 37-38, 41 (citing Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U.S. 28 (2019)).  Ra-\nther, they are commands and delegations that do not conflict or \noverride any operative language from the statute and quite inten-\ntionally leave the agency with flexibility to regulate.  This Court \nhas recognized that such provisions should be applied as written.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 & n.6 (2024).   \n\n17 \nIV. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not For-\nbid the NRC from Licensing Private Parties\u2019 \nTemporary Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nAway from a Reactor Site. \nRespondents \nfundamentally \nmisconstrue \nthe \nNWPA.  They erroneously contend that it is the \nNWPA, rather than the AEA, that must provide the \n\u201cstatutory authority to license ISP\u2019s private, offsite \nstorage.\u201d  Fasken Br. 17; Texas Br. 29-31.  That is just \nnot so.  E.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121 (NWPA \n\u201cgoverns the establishment of a federal repository for \npermanent storage [i.e., disposal], not temporary stor-\nage by private parties.\u201d).  It is true enough that peti-\ntioners \u201cdo not contend the NWPA authorizes ISP\u2019s li-\ncense\u201d (Fasken Br. 20), but that is because no one ever \nthought that the NWPA was enacted to do so.  And it \nwasn\u2019t, as confirmed by the text, structure, and legis-\nlative history of that law. \nRegarding the text: the Fifth Circuit held that the \nNWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the ISP license, ISP App. 30a, \nbut cited no statutory provision that says that.  Nor do \nrespondents.  There is none.  Fasken contends that 42 \nU.S.C. 10155(h) \u201cspecifically forbids\u201d private offsite \nstorage facilities (Fasken Br. 19), but that provision \ndoes not \u201cforbid\u201d anything at all.9  Rather, the provi-\nsion says \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d\u2014meaning the \nNWPA\u2014\u201cshall be construed to * * * authorize\u201d private \n9 42 U.S.C. 10155(h): \u201cApplication * * * Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, nothing in this chapter shall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or Federal \nuse, purchase, lease or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian power nuclear reactor \nand not owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d \n\n18 \nstorage facilities.  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  In \nother words, the provision limits the scope of the \nNWPA.  But the NWPA is not, and never has been, the \nsource of the NRC\u2019s licensing authority at issue here.  \nRespondents\u2019 position cannot be squared with the stat-\nute\u2019s words\u2014it would make no sense for Congress to \nsay that the law did nothing to \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cre-\nquire\u201d an activity if (as respondents argue) that activ-\nity was already altogether banned.  Respondents can \npoint to no statutory text whatsoever to support their \nmain substantive position. \nRegarding the structure: The overall purpose of the \nNWPA was to establish the federal government\u2019s re-\nsponsibilities for the permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Subpart A set forth a plan for a permanent \nrepository.  42 U.S.C. 10131-10145.  Subpart B deals \nwith an interim storage program by the federal govern-\nment, pending permanent disposal.  42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157.  That was a limited program, designed to help \nutilities manage spent nuclear fuel while waiting for a \npermanent disposal site, and\u2014significantly\u2014it ex-\npired by its terms in 1990.  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).  That \nis, there were a number of conditions and processes as-\nsociated with the program, including a requirement \nthat any utility desiring to participate execute a con-\ntract with the federal government \u201cno later than Jan-\nuary 1, 1990.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).   \nRespondents chiefly rely upon provisions within \nthat Subpart B.  Texas Br. 29-31; Fasken Br. 18 (citing \n42 U.S.C. 10152, 10153, 10154).  Importantly, how-\never, all of those provisions concerned the limited fed-\neral interim storage program in Subpart B, and there-\nfore can be properly understood only as \u201cpreconditions \n\n19 \non private generators for obtaining federal interim \nstorage.\u201d  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  It is plainly \nwrong for respondents to argue that those now-expired\nportions of Subpart B are, instead, the only potential \nsource of the NRC\u2019s current authority to license a pri-\nvate party\u2019s possession of spent nuclear fuel at all, an-\nywhere.  E.g., Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 299 (9th \nCir. 1991) (\u201cThe Act\u2019s restrictive language [in Subpart \nB] limits the requirements to the specific set of reme-\ndial storage agreements authorized by the Act itself.\u201d). \nRegarding the legislative history:  First, and im-\nportantly, the legislative history conclusively confirms \nthat Congress was fully aware that the AEA had been \ninterpreted and applied by the NRC to authorize off-\nsite storage of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  \nE.g., S. Rep. No. 97-282, at 44 (1981); see Bullcreek, \n359 F.3d at 542; In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, \nCLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, 400 (Dec. 18, 2002) (\u201cMem-\nbers of Congress clearly were well aware that \u2018other \nprovisions of law\u2019 authorized private [away-from-reac-\ntor] storage facilities, as the existence, and fate, of \nsuch facilities was discussed in congressional commit-\ntee debates.\u201d), & n.35, n.44, n.45 (citations omitted).10\nCongress, of course, is presumed to know the state of \nthe law when it enacts legislation, e.g., Edelman v. \nLynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 117-118 (2002), and \nhere that knowledge is unquestionable.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that the meaning of the AEA should be in-\nformed by the subsequent NWPA (Texas Br. 28) is fair \n10 In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, 56 N.R.C. at 399-\n410, cites and summarizes the voluminous relevant legislative \nhistory in a far more comprehensive manner than space will allow \nfor here. \n\n20 \nenough as a general proposition, but that proposition \ncuts squarely against respondents in this case.   \nSecond, with regard to the federal interim storage \nprogram invoked by respondents, the legislative his-\ntory reveals efforts to balance competing concerns \nabout the nature and scope of such a program. See \nS. Rep. No. 97-282 (1981); H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, pt. 1 \n(1982); 128 Cong. Rec. 28,032 (1982).  Sec-\ntion 10155(h), on which respondents heavily rely, went \nthrough drafts and debates which confirm that its ul-\ntimate role was to ensure that DOE would not take \nover private facilities to fulfill its NWPA responsibili-\nties, and that also make clear that utilities would not \nhave to exhaust potential off-site storage options to \ngain access to the federal interim storage program at \nSubpart B (which had been a requirement in some \nearly drafts).11  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 543.  Signif-\nicantly, however, \u201c[n]othing in those reports and de-\nbates suggests that Congress intended to prohibit pri-\nvate use of private away-from-reactor facilities.\u201d  Ibid.\nAlthough they avoided or disavowed it below,12 it \nis apparent that respondents\u2019 real argument is that \n11 See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, at 20 (1982), reprinted \nin part in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3792 (H.R. 3809, \u00a7 133(b)(1)(D)), re-\nported out of the House Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs on \nApril 27, 1982; Nuclear Waste Disposal Policy: Hearing Before the \nSubcomm. on Energy Conservation and Power of the House \nComm. on Energy and Commerce on H.R. 1993, H.R. 2881, H.R. \n3809, and H.R. 5016, 97th Cong. 2-3 (1982) (reference to \u201ctenta-\ntive agreement\u201d requiring generators to exhaust private offsite \nstorage as options in order to access federal interim storage). \n12 21-60743 State Pets.

Texas Br. 28, 43; Fasken Br. 21-23.  \nRespondents have not come close to clearing that high \nhurdle in this case.  E.g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 549 (1974).  The preexisting NRC authority under \nthe AEA to license private parties to store spent nu-\nclear fuel away from existing reactor sites was not \nmerely \u201cimplied,\u201d as Fasken argues.  Fasken Br. 22 \n(citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988)).  Rather, that AEA authority was demonstra-\nbly and indisputably known to Congress when it \npassed the NWPA, and formally enshrined in the Code \nof Federal Regulations after extensive notice-and com-\nment processes (which Texas contends \u201cprompted \nalarm,\u201d Texas Br. 3).  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542-\n543.  And, as explained above, there is no conflict \nwhatsoever, much less any \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d \n(Fasken Br. 22 (citation omitted)) between the AEA \nand NWPA with regard to the NRC\u2019s authority to li-\ncense private parties to temporarily possess spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Respondents\u2019 case for repeal by implication \nfalls woefully short. \nFinally, both respondents invoke West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  Fasken Br. 32-33; Texas Br. \n31, 35.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case, previously shaped solely by the petitioners' arguments, has now been significantly updated and complicated by the introduction of the respondents' (Texas's) brief. The counterarguments presented by Texas directly challenge the core premises of the petitioners' case on both the procedural and substantive questions.\n\nMy beliefs, which now integrate both sides of the argument, are as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My prior belief was that the petitioners had a strong textualist argument that Texas, as a non-participant in the NRC's administrative process, was not a \"party aggrieved\" and thus lacked standing. This belief is now contested by several new arguments from Texas:\n    *   **Factual Counter-Claim:** Texas asserts that it *did* participate in the agency proceedings by lodging objections to the license, thereby qualifying as a \"party aggrieved\" under a plain reading of the term. This introduces a factual dispute that complicates the petitioners' clean narrative.\n    *   **Separation of Powers Argument:** Texas argues that an agency (the NRC) cannot use its own procedural rules to limit the jurisdictional grant given to federal courts by Congress in the Hobbs Act. Citing precedents like *Kucana v. Holder*, Texas frames this as an issue of agency overreach, arguing for a strong presumption of judicial review that cannot be easily stripped away by agency regulation. This shifts the focus from a simple definition of \"party\" to a broader question of judicial authority.\n    *   **Defense of the *Ultra Vires* Exception:** Texas defends the Fifth Circuit's alternative holding, arguing that courts have inherent power to review and enjoin agency actions that are taken completely outside of their statutory authority (*ultra vires*), citing foundational cases like *Leedom v. Kyne*.\n    *   **Updated Belief:** The procedural question is no longer a straightforward textual issue. It is now a three-pronged debate involving factual participation, the limits of agency power to define judicial jurisdiction, and the validity of the *ultra vires* exception. My confidence in the petitioners' position on this question has decreased, as Texas has provided plausible, well-supported counterarguments that appeal to judicial authority and the presumption of reviewability.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My previous understanding was that the petitioners made a compelling case based on the AEA's broad grant of authority and the NWPA's limited scope. Texas has mounted a formidable challenge to this view.\n    *   **AEA as a Limited Grant:** Texas counters the petitioners' narrative by arguing the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) does not provide a blanket authorization. Instead, they conduct a close reading of specific sections (\u00a72073, \u00a72093, \u00a72111), arguing that none explicitly authorize licensing *private, away-from-reactor* storage. They contend the NRC is impermissibly stitching together unrelated provisions to invent a power Congress never granted.\n    *   **NWPA as an Exclusive Scheme:** This is a critical new belief. Where the petitioners see the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) as a non-exclusive solution for a permanent repository, Texas argues it is a **comprehensive and exclusive statutory scheme** for all spent fuel disposal. Texas points out that Congress meticulously detailed a plan for a permanent repository (Yucca Mountain) and for *federally-owned* temporary storage, but deliberately omitted any mention of *private* temporary storage. This makes a powerful structural argument that Congress considered and rejected the very scheme the NRC has now licensed.\n    *   **Introduction of the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** This is the most significant new signal. Texas explicitly invokes the MQD, citing recent, landmark Supreme Court decisions like *West Virginia v. EPA* and *Biden v. Nebraska*. They argue that authorizing a private company to create a de facto permanent nuclear waste site\u2014a matter of vast economic and political significance, especially over a state's explicit opposition\u2014requires a clear and unambiguous statement from Congress. They assert that no such clear authorization exists in either the AEA or the NWPA. This argument is highly resonant with the current Court's jurisprudence and provides a powerful, independent basis for affirming the Fifth Circuit.\n    *   **Dismantling the \"Judicial Consensus\":** Texas directly attacks the petitioners' claim that the Fifth Circuit is an outlier. They argue that prior cases from other circuits (*Skull Valley*, *Bullcreek*) are \"inapposite\" because they did not fully grapple with the NWPA's exclusive structure or were decided before the maturation of the Major Questions Doctrine. This new argument weakens the petitioners' narrative of a stable, disrupted consensus.\n\nThe latest observation, which reflects my internal reasoning after synthesizing the primary briefs, does not introduce new external evidence but instead confirms and solidifies my updated belief state. It reinforces my assessment that the introduction of the respondents' arguments has fundamentally altered the landscape of this case. My belief that the case now leans in favor of the respondents (Texas) is strengthened, as their arguments\u2014particularly the invocation of the Major Questions Doctrine and the structural argument about the NWPA's exclusivity\u2014appear highly resonant with the current Court's jurisprudential trends in administrative law. Crucially, this period of synthesis has clarified the most significant remaining uncertainty: how the petitioners will respond to these powerful, potentially case-deciding arguments. My focus is now sharply directed towards obtaining and analyzing the petitioners' reply brief, as it represents the most direct and informative piece of evidence to resolve this uncertainty and further refine my prediction.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My belief state, previously updated to heavily favor the respondents (Texas) after analyzing their brief, has now been substantially revised by the petitioners' reply brief. The reply brief directly confronts and attempts to dismantle Texas's most powerful arguments, re-centering the case on the petitioners' core claims and significantly altering my assessment of the likely outcome.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs, now incorporating the arguments from all primary briefs, are as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief that this was a complex, multi-pronged debate has now sharpened, and I believe the petitioners have gained a significant advantage. The reply brief makes several critical counter-arguments:\n    *   **Textual Primacy (\"Party\" vs. \"Participant\"):** The petitioners forcefully argue that the statutory text \"party aggrieved\" is dispositive and intentionally different from \"person aggrieved\" (used in the APA) or \"participant aggrieved\" (the term Texas wishes the Court to adopt). They ground this in textualist reasoning, citing opinions from then-Judge Scalia (*Simmons v. ICC*) and Judge Easterbrook, which will likely resonate with the current Court. This directly refutes Texas's attempt to redefine the term based on its actions.\n    *   **Reframing the \"Closed Courthouse Door\":** The petitioners effectively counter Texas's separation-of-powers argument. They contend that the courthouse door was never closed; rather, Texas deliberately chose not to walk through the established entrance (the NRC's intervention process). They frame this not as an agency stripping courts of jurisdiction, but as a litigant failing to avail itself of a clear, established statutory path to judicial review.\n    *   **Neutralizing the *Ultra Vires* Exception:** This is a major shift in my belief. The petitioners deliver a powerful rebuttal to the Fifth Circuit's *ultra vires* justification by citing *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.* They argue that the *ultra vires* doctrine, as articulated in cases like *Leedom v. Kyne*, is a narrow exception applicable only when a statutory scheme offers *no* path for judicial review. Here, the Hobbs Act *does* provide a path, but Texas and Fasken failed to meet its threshold requirement of being a \"party.\" This distinction between a non-existent review path and a deliberately bypassed one is a critical legal point that severely undermines the Fifth Circuit's alternative holding.\n    *   **Updated Belief:** My confidence in Texas's procedural arguments has plummeted. The petitioners have presented a clear, text-based, and precedentially supported argument that Texas lacked standing. The *MCorp* argument, in particular, provides the Court with a strong, narrow basis to reverse the Fifth Circuit on procedural grounds alone, thereby avoiding the more complex substantive questions. I now believe the petitioners have the stronger position on the procedural issue.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** The petitioners' reply brief blunts the momentum Texas had gained, particularly on the NWPA and the Major Questions Doctrine.\n    *   **Reasserting AEA Authority:** The petitioners double down on their interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) as a broad grant of authority, arguing Texas's reading is inconsistent with precedent (*Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.*) and relies on flawed interpretive canons. They portray the NRC's action not as an invention of new power, but as a routine application of its long-standing mandate to regulate the constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel.\n    *   **Contesting NWPA Exclusivity:** This is a crucial counter-narrative. The petitioners directly challenge Texas's central claim that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) is a \"comprehensive and exclusive\" scheme. Their core argument is that the NWPA's silence on *private* interim storage is not a prohibition. They argue the NWPA created a federal program to solve a specific problem (permanent disposal) but did not implicitly repeal the NRC's separate, pre-existing authority under the AEA to license private activity. They re-assert that the Fifth Circuit is an outlier, directly challenging Texas's attempts to distinguish contrary precedents like *Bullcreek* and *Skull Valley*.\n    *   **Confronting the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** My previous belief was that the MQD was Texas's strongest argument. The petitioners' reply brief directly engages with it, citing *West Virginia v. EPA*. While the full argument is not visible, their strategy appears to be to cabin the doctrine's applicability. They argue that licensing a storage facility, while significant, is not the kind of transformative, economy-altering assertion of a novel power that triggered the MQD in *West Virginia*. Instead, they frame it as a core, traditional function of the NRC, for which the AEA provides a sufficiently clear statutory statement of authority.\n    *   **Updated Belief:** The substantive question is now a true clash of titans. The petitioners have successfully re-established their narrative, preventing Texas from running away with the case based on the MQD. The central dispute is now sharply defined: Did the NWPA's detailed federal plan implicitly forbid private solutions under the AEA's general authority? And is the licensing of a private storage facility over a state's objection a \"major question\" requiring a crystal-clear statement from Congress that the AEA lacks? While Texas's MQD argument remains potent, the petitioners have provided a plausible path for the Court to rule that the doctrine does not apply here. My belief has shifted from strongly favoring Texas on the merits to seeing it as a much closer call, hinging on the Court's characterization of the agency's action and its appetite for applying the MQD in this context.\n\n**Overall Synthesis:** The petitioners' reply brief has been highly effective. It has transformed the procedural question from a toss-up into a likely strength for them. On the substantive question, it has successfully countered Texas's most powerful arguments, turning the debate back into a fundamental conflict over statutory interpretation. My overall prediction has shifted from favoring Texas to now slightly favoring the petitioners, primarily because they have a very strong \"off-ramp\" to win on procedural grounds, allowing the Court to avoid the thorny substantive issues of nuclear waste policy.",

It needed a site \nisolated from large civilian populations, with plenty \nof water and easy access to electricity. Ultimately, it \nchose an area outside the small town of Arco, Idaho, \nand established the Idaho National Laboratory \n(\u201cINL\u201d), a cutting-edge, 890-square-mile research \nfacility tasked with the development of nuclear \nelectricity. On December 20, 1951, INL made history \nwhen, for the first time, atomic energy was safely \nused to produce electricity. It powered four lightbulbs.  \nSince then, 52 reactors have been built and \noperated at INL by the Department of Energy \n(\u201cDOE\u201d). INL\u2019s current capabilities include testing \nadvanced nuclear energy concepts, turning nuclear \nwaste into medical radioisotopes or fuel for various \nindustries, \nfurthering \nspace \nexploration, \nand \nsupporting the Navy\u2019s Nuclear Propulsion Program. \nThese research projects have produced significant \nadvances in the science of nuclear energy. \nThe projects have also left substantial nuclear \nwaste sitting above an aquifer that 400,000 people \ndrink from\u2014waste the federal government has \npromised to remove from Idaho by 2035. \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThere is a single, clear, correct solution for storing \nAmerica\u2019s nuclear waste: permanent geologic storage \nin a single secure location. Fortunately, this clear \nsolution is the official policy of the United States, \nestablished decades ago by multiple acts of Congress. \nUnfortunately, the agencies responsible for nuclear \nwaste refuse to comply with the policy. \nInstead, the NRC is peddling the equivalent of \nduct tape on a broken window: \u201cconsent-based siting,\u201d \nwhich in practice means the ad hoc licensing of \nallegedly temporary storage facilities as existing \nstorage fills up. For the United States as a whole, ad \nhoc siting will mean far more civilians at risk, with \nnuclear waste spread around the country instead of \nconcentrated in one remote site. It will also \ndramatically complicate efforts to secure the waste \nand increase the threat of every nuclear danger, from \nbarrels leaking in the water supply to theft by \nterrorists developing dirty bombs. \nFor Idaho specifically, the NRC\u2019s illegal ad hoc \nlicensing will inevitably mean betrayal. For decades, \nIdaho has not only been a gracious host to the federal \ngovernment\u2019s nuclear energy programs but also \naccepted additional waste from outside the state, all \nbased on DOE\u2019s promise to remove all nuclear waste \nfrom the State by 2035. Ad hoc temporary licensing \nwill not be enough for DOE to keep its promise to \nIdaho\u2014if DOE persists in its \u201cconsent-based\u201d \napproach, nuclear waste will remain in Idaho \nindefinitely, and without Idaho\u2019s consent. \nThe only way DOE can keep its promise to Idaho\u2014\nand the only way DOE can comply with congressional \n\n3 \n \ninstructions going back decades\u2014is to build a \npermanent repository. So, instead of handing the \nNRC another roll of tape by upholding its lawless \ntemporary licenses, the Court should strike them \ndown and push DOE back towards the permanent \nsolution chosen by Congress. \nARGUMENT \nI. Nuclear Waste Must Be Stored at Yucca \nMountain\u2014Not Idaho or Anywhere Else. \nThe federal government promised Idaho 30 years \nago that the State would not become a permanent \nrepository for nuclear waste. At the time, Idaho \nbelieved that promise because Congress had \u201cimposed \n[a] responsibility upon the federal government\u201d to \nconstruct the permanent repository for nuclear waste \nat Yucca Mountain with sufficient capacity to store \nthe waste being held at INL, and the federal \ngovernment to that point had shown every intent to \ncarry out Congress\u2019s directions. In re Aiken Cnty., 645 \nF.3d 428, 431\u201332 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (recapping relevant \nhistory). \nBut now that the federal government has scuttled \nits plans to construct a permanent repository at Yucca \nMountain, there is not enough storage capacity for the \ngrowing volume of nuclear waste. The nuclear waste \nproblem is too large for stop-gap solutions and is \ngrowing every day. Texas v. NRC, 78 F.4th 827, 833 \n(5th Cir. 2023). Unless DOE resumes efforts at Yucca \nMountain, it will inevitably betray its word and leave \nnuclear waste in Idaho indefinitely after all.  \nTo explain, Idaho began permitting DOE to store \nlimited quantities of spent nuclear fuel used by the \n\n4 \n \nNavy at INL in 1957.1 The Navy used nuclear fuel to \npower its submarines and aircraft carriers, and the \nspent nuclear fuel was sent to INL for management \nand storage.2  \nHowever, the spent nuclear fuel\u2014along with other \nwaste products generated at INL\u2014was not always \nmanaged in responsible ways. Often, the nuclear \nwaste was shallowly buried in the soil, sometimes \nhoused in nothing more than steel drums.  \nAs a result of these troubling storage practices, \nleaks from the buried nuclear waste at INL were \ndiscovered at INL in 1987.3 These leaks were \nextremely disturbing to Idaho\u2014INL is located above \nthe Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, which is as large as \nLake Erie and provides drinking water for 400,000 \npeople and irrigation for one million acres of \nagriculture. Based on these leaks, INL was \ndesignated as a superfund site in 1989, and clean-up \nof the site has been ongoing since that time.4  \nBut in 1991, DOE informed Idaho that it would be \nshipping more nuclear waste into the State for storage \nin addition to the Navy\u2019s spent nuclear fuel, this time \nfrom the new Fort St. Vrain reactor in Colorado. \n \n1 Keith Ridler, US Navy says it met Idaho deadline on spent \nnuclear \nfuel, \nNavy \nTimes \n(May \n25, \n2021), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4m77zn9c. \n2 \nEPA, \nNuclear \nSubmarines \nand \nAircraft \nCarriers, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc748hfa (last visited January 15, 2025).  \n3 Keith Schneider, Plutonium Leak in Idaho Symptom of Atomic \nIlls, N.Y.

E.g., id. at 297. \nIn 1995, after years of litigation, Idaho, DOE, and \nthe Navy finally reached a binding settlement \nagreement.5 The three guiding principles for the \nagreement were: (1) Idaho must not become a default \nrepository for nuclear waste, (2) DOE must clean up \nand transport out the nuclear waste already in Idaho \nby 2035, and (3) INL would become a lead laboratory \nfor research of spent nuclear fuel.6 In exchange, Idaho \nagreed to allow DOE and the Navy to continue to ship \nsmall amounts of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho every \nyear. Idaho has entered into subsequent agreements \nwith DOE and the Navy regarding the treatment, \n \n5 Idaho Dep\u2019t Env\u2019t Quality, 1995 Settlement Agreement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc267vrt (last visited January 15, 2025).  \n6 DOE, Explaining Idaho\u2019s Unique Settlement Agreement (Aug. \n17, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/7zr3wtb5. \n\n6 \n \nmanagement, and disposal of nuclear waste at the \nINL.7 In each subsequent agreement, Idaho has \nremained \nsteadfast \nin \nrequiring \nthe \nfederal \ngovernment to keep its promise to remove nuclear \nwaste from Idaho. \nWithout Yucca Mountain, it is inevitable that \nDOE will breach its agreement with Idaho. Even with \ntemporary storage sites and consent-based siting, it is \nsimply unclear where DOE could transport all of the \nnuclear waste that it currently has stored in Idaho.8 \nIndeed, more than 88,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel from commercial reactors is currently stranded at \nreactor sites with no place to go.9 \nThe good news is that breach can be avoided with \na simple solution\u2014DOE can build the permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain like Congress told it to \ndo. As long as DOE is allowed to continue licensing \ntemporary storage facilities (unlawfully, see infra), it \ncan evade its obligations to construct a permanent \nrepository and put off (at least temporarily) the \npractical consequences.

Short-Term Storage Sites Are Neither Safe \nNor Authorized. \nNot only are temporary storage sites insufficient \nto address the ever-expanding nuclear waste problem, \nbut they\u2019re also unsafe and not authorized by any \nstatute. \nIdaho is terribly conscious of the hazards \nassociated with nuclear energy. In January 1961, a \nnuclear accident occurred at INL when a small test \nreactor exploded.10 The explosion resulted in three \ndeaths, which were the first\u2014and still the only\u2014\nfatalities in the history of United States nuclear \nreactor operations.  \nThose hazards don\u2019t disappear when nuclear fuel \nbecomes spent. Spent nuclear fuel is still radioactive, \nexplosive, and highly volatile.

Dep\u2019t of Ecology, Handford leaking tanks ...... 7 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE \nAmerican nuclear energy began in Idaho. \nAfter the Manhattan Project and the end of World \nWar II, the federal government decided to build the \nworld\u2019s first nuclear power plant. It needed a site \nisolated from large civilian populations, with plenty \nof water and easy access to electricity. Ultimately, it \nchose an area outside the small town of Arco, Idaho, \nand established the Idaho National Laboratory \n(\u201cINL\u201d), a cutting-edge, 890-square-mile research \nfacility tasked with the development of nuclear \nelectricity. On December 20, 1951, INL made history \nwhen, for the first time, atomic energy was safely \nused to produce electricity. It powered four lightbulbs.  \nSince then, 52 reactors have been built and \noperated at INL by the Department of Energy \n(\u201cDOE\u201d). INL\u2019s current capabilities include testing \nadvanced nuclear energy concepts, turning nuclear \nwaste into medical radioisotopes or fuel for various \nindustries, \nfurthering \nspace \nexploration, \nand \nsupporting the Navy\u2019s Nuclear Propulsion Program. \nThese research projects have produced significant \nadvances in the science of nuclear energy. \nThe projects have also left substantial nuclear \nwaste sitting above an aquifer that 400,000 people \ndrink from\u2014waste the federal government has \npromised to remove from Idaho by 2035. \n \n \n \n\n2 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThere is a single, clear, correct solution for storing \nAmerica\u2019s nuclear waste: permanent geologic storage \nin a single secure location. Fortunately, this clear \nsolution is the official policy of the United States, \nestablished decades ago by multiple acts of Congress. \nUnfortunately, the agencies responsible for nuclear \nwaste refuse to comply with the policy. \nInstead, the NRC is peddling the equivalent of \nduct tape on a broken window: \u201cconsent-based siting,\u201d \nwhich in practice means the ad hoc licensing of \nallegedly temporary storage facilities as existing \nstorage fills up. For the United States as a whole, ad \nhoc siting will mean far more civilians at risk, with \nnuclear waste spread around the country instead of \nconcentrated in one remote site. It will also \ndramatically complicate efforts to secure the waste \nand increase the threat of every nuclear danger, from \nbarrels leaking in the water supply to theft by \nterrorists developing dirty bombs. \nFor Idaho specifically, the NRC\u2019s illegal ad hoc \nlicensing will inevitably mean betrayal. For decades, \nIdaho has not only been a gracious host to the federal \ngovernment\u2019s nuclear energy programs but also \naccepted additional waste from outside the state, all \nbased on DOE\u2019s promise to remove all nuclear waste \nfrom the State by 2035. Ad hoc temporary licensing \nwill not be enough for DOE to keep its promise to \nIdaho\u2014if DOE persists in its \u201cconsent-based\u201d \napproach, nuclear waste will remain in Idaho \nindefinitely, and without Idaho\u2019s consent. \nThe only way DOE can keep its promise to Idaho\u2014\nand the only way DOE can comply with congressional \n\n3 \n \ninstructions going back decades\u2014is to build a \npermanent repository. So, instead of handing the \nNRC another roll of tape by upholding its lawless \ntemporary licenses, the Court should strike them \ndown and push DOE back towards the permanent \nsolution chosen by Congress. \nARGUMENT \nI. Nuclear Waste Must Be Stored at Yucca \nMountain\u2014Not Idaho or Anywhere Else. \nThe federal government promised Idaho 30 years \nago that the State would not become a permanent \nrepository for nuclear waste. At the time, Idaho \nbelieved that promise because Congress had \u201cimposed \n[a] responsibility upon the federal government\u201d to \nconstruct the permanent repository for nuclear waste \nat Yucca Mountain with sufficient capacity to store \nthe waste being held at INL, and the federal \ngovernment to that point had shown every intent to \ncarry out Congress\u2019s directions. In re Aiken Cnty., 645 \nF.3d 428, 431\u201332 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (recapping relevant \nhistory). \nBut now that the federal government has scuttled \nits plans to construct a permanent repository at Yucca \nMountain, there is not enough storage capacity for the \ngrowing volume of nuclear waste. The nuclear waste \nproblem is too large for stop-gap solutions and is \ngrowing every day. Texas v. NRC, 78 F.4th 827, 833 \n(5th Cir. 2023). Unless DOE resumes efforts at Yucca \nMountain, it will inevitably betray its word and leave \nnuclear waste in Idaho indefinitely after all.  \nTo explain, Idaho began permitting DOE to store \nlimited quantities of spent nuclear fuel used by the \n\n4 \n \nNavy at INL in 1957.1 The Navy used nuclear fuel to \npower its submarines and aircraft carriers, and the \nspent nuclear fuel was sent to INL for management \nand storage.2  \nHowever, the spent nuclear fuel\u2014along with other \nwaste products generated at INL\u2014was not always \nmanaged in responsible ways. Often, the nuclear \nwaste was shallowly buried in the soil, sometimes \nhoused in nothing more than steel drums.  \nAs a result of these troubling storage practices, \nleaks from the buried nuclear waste at INL were \ndiscovered at INL in 1987.3 These leaks were \nextremely disturbing to Idaho\u2014INL is located above \nthe Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, which is as large as \nLake Erie and provides drinking water for 400,000 \npeople and irrigation for one million acres of \nagriculture. Based on these leaks, INL was \ndesignated as a superfund site in 1989, and clean-up \nof the site has been ongoing since that time.4  \nBut in 1991, DOE informed Idaho that it would be \nshipping more nuclear waste into the State for storage \nin addition to the Navy\u2019s spent nuclear fuel, this time \nfrom the new Fort St. Vrain reactor in Colorado. \n \n1 Keith Ridler, US Navy says it met Idaho deadline on spent \nnuclear \nfuel, \nNavy \nTimes \n(May \n25, \n2021), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/4m77zn9c. \n2 \nEPA, \nNuclear \nSubmarines \nand \nAircraft \nCarriers, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc748hfa (last visited January 15, 2025).  \n3 Keith Schneider, Plutonium Leak in Idaho Symptom of Atomic \nIlls, N.Y.

E.g., id. at 297. \nIn 1995, after years of litigation, Idaho, DOE, and \nthe Navy finally reached a binding settlement \nagreement.5 The three guiding principles for the \nagreement were: (1) Idaho must not become a default \nrepository for nuclear waste, (2) DOE must clean up \nand transport out the nuclear waste already in Idaho \nby 2035, and (3) INL would become a lead laboratory \nfor research of spent nuclear fuel.6 In exchange, Idaho \nagreed to allow DOE and the Navy to continue to ship \nsmall amounts of spent nuclear fuel into Idaho every \nyear. Idaho has entered into subsequent agreements \nwith DOE and the Navy regarding the treatment, \n \n5 Idaho Dep\u2019t Env\u2019t Quality, 1995 Settlement Agreement, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yc267vrt (last visited January 15, 2025).  \n6 DOE, Explaining Idaho\u2019s Unique Settlement Agreement (Aug. \n17, 2021), https://tinyurl.com/7zr3wtb5. \n\n6 \n \nmanagement, and disposal of nuclear waste at the \nINL.7 In each subsequent agreement, Idaho has \nremained \nsteadfast \nin \nrequiring \nthe \nfederal \ngovernment to keep its promise to remove nuclear \nwaste from Idaho. \nWithout Yucca Mountain, it is inevitable that \nDOE will breach its agreement with Idaho. Even with \ntemporary storage sites and consent-based siting, it is \nsimply unclear where DOE could transport all of the \nnuclear waste that it currently has stored in Idaho.8 \nIndeed, more than 88,000 metric tons of spent nuclear \nfuel from commercial reactors is currently stranded at \nreactor sites with no place to go.9 \nThe good news is that breach can be avoided with \na simple solution\u2014DOE can build the permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain like Congress told it to \ndo. As long as DOE is allowed to continue licensing \ntemporary storage facilities (unlawfully, see infra), it \ncan evade its obligations to construct a permanent \nrepository and put off (at least temporarily) the \npractical consequences.

Short-Term Storage Sites Are Neither Safe \nNor Authorized. \nNot only are temporary storage sites insufficient \nto address the ever-expanding nuclear waste problem, \nbut they\u2019re also unsafe and not authorized by any \nstatute. \nIdaho is terribly conscious of the hazards \nassociated with nuclear energy. In January 1961, a \nnuclear accident occurred at INL when a small test \nreactor exploded.10 The explosion resulted in three \ndeaths, which were the first\u2014and still the only\u2014\nfatalities in the history of United States nuclear \nreactor operations.  \nThose hazards don\u2019t disappear when nuclear fuel \nbecomes spent. Spent nuclear fuel is still radioactive, \nexplosive, and highly volatile. High-level spent \nnuclear fuel can still \u201cproduce fatal radiation doses\u201d \nfor millennia\u2014the plutonium it contains has a half-\nlife of 24,000 years.11 As storage containers for \nnuclear waste break down and leak\u2014as is inevitable \nwith even the best technology,12 and as Idaho \n \n10 Idaho National Laboratory, SL-1, Idaho Just the Facts, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/2tj7t33n (last visited Jan. 21, 2025). \n11 \nNRC, \nBackgrounder \non \nRadioactive \nWaste, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3jhcc38k (last updated Jan. 26, 2024).  \n12 Andrew Grant, The Hardcore Nuclear-Waste Containers That \nCan Stand up to Airplane Crashes, Discover Mag.

Increasing the number of storage sites\u2014and \nprivate \nones \nat \nthat\u2014makes \nsecurity \nmore \nchallenging, places nuclear waste near more civilians, \nand increases the chances that waste will be stored \nimproperly.15 \nStoring nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, by \ncontrast, lowers the risks.

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state, solidified after a comprehensive review of the petitioners' opening brief, the respondents' brief, and the petitioners' highly effective reply brief, remains stable. The latest observation, an internal reflection on the current state of knowledge, introduces no new external evidence but confirms my assessment and identifies the next critical area for investigation.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs, now based on the complete set of primary party arguments, are as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief that the petitioners hold a decisive advantage on this issue is reinforced. The reply brief's arguments appear robust.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' textualist argument, distinguishing \"party aggrieved\" (Hobbs Act) from \"person aggrieved\" (APA), provides a clear, narrow ground for reversal that is likely to appeal to the current Court.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The reframing of the \"closed courthouse door\" argument as a failure by Texas to use the available statutory intervention process is a powerful counter-narrative to Texas's separation-of-powers claim.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The citation of *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.* remains the petitioners' silver bullet against the Fifth Circuit's *ultra vires* reasoning. The distinction between a non-existent path to judicial review (where *Leedom v. Kyne* might apply) and a deliberately bypassed one (the situation here) severely undermines the respondents' position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The procedural issue provides a strong \"off-ramp\" for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit without reaching the more complex substantive questions. My confidence in the petitioners' position on this question is high.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief that this is a very close and contentious issue is also reinforced. The petitioners successfully blunted the force of Texas's arguments, particularly the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD).\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The core of the substantive debate is a direct clash of statutory interpretation: Does the Atomic Energy Act's (AEA) broad grant of authority to the NRC to regulate nuclear materials survive the subsequent passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA)? Or did the NWPA's creation of a federal program for a permanent repository implicitly occupy the field and prohibit private interim storage solutions?\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' argument that the NWPA's silence on private storage is not a prohibition, and that it did not implicitly repeal the NRC's pre-existing AEA authority, is a plausible counter to Texas's \"comprehensive and exclusive\" framework.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The applicability of the Major Questions Doctrine remains the central battleground. Texas argues that licensing a private facility over a state's express objection is a question of vast \"economic and political significance\" requiring a clear statement from Congress. The petitioners counter that this is not a novel assertion of power like that in *West Virginia v. EPA*, but rather a core, traditional function of the NRC under its existing AEA mandate. The outcome likely hinges on how the Court chooses to frame the agency's action. My belief has settled from strongly favoring Texas on this point to viewing it as a genuine toss-up.\n\n3.  **New Dimension - Strategic Uncertainty and Amicus Influence:** The latest observation confirms that my analysis of the primary briefs is complete. It explicitly identifies the primary source of remaining uncertainty: the influence and arguments of *amici curiae* (friends of the court). My understanding has now evolved to recognize that predicting the outcome requires moving beyond the parties' direct arguments to assess the broader landscape of support.\n    *   **Identified Uncertainty:** The number and identity of amici supporting each side will serve as a crucial signal to the Court regarding the real-world stakes of the decision.\n    *   **Key Questions to Resolve:** I now need to determine:\n        *   Are other states supporting Texas, signaling a broad concern about federalism and states' rights?\n        *   Is the nuclear power industry supporting the petitioners, signaling the economic necessity of interim storage for the continued operation of nuclear plants?\n        *   Are there arguments from legal scholars or other groups that might introduce novel perspectives or highlight unforeseen consequences?\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** The answers to these questions will provide vital context about the political, economic, and federalism implications, which can subtly or overtly influence judicial reasoning, especially on a \"major question.\"\n\n**Overall Synthesis:** My prediction continues to slightly favor the petitioners, largely due to the strength of their procedural argument which offers the Court a clean, narrow basis for reversal. However, my belief state is now characterized by an awareness that the primary legal arguments are fully mapped, and the next determinative factor will be the weight and substance of the amicus briefs. My analysis is now poised to incorporate this broader context.",

          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been updated by the observation of a significant amicus brief filed by the State of Idaho in support of the respondents (Texas). This new evidence directly addresses the strategic uncertainties I had previously identified, providing crucial context on the federalism and policy dimensions of the case. My core understanding of the parties' primary arguments remains, but the landscape of the substantive question has now shifted.\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My beliefs on this issue remain stable, as the new observation does not introduce arguments related to it.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' textualist argument (\"party aggrieved\" vs. \"person aggrieved\") and their reliance on *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.* continue to represent a powerful and narrow basis for reversal. This procedural \"off-ramp\" allows the Court to resolve the case without engaging the more complex substantive issues. My confidence remains high that the petitioners have the stronger position on this question.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** The amicus brief from Idaho significantly develops my understanding and strengthens the respondents' position on the merits. What was previously a \"toss-up\" now appears to have more weight on the side of Texas and its allies.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The central conflict remains the petitioners' claim of broad, pre-existing authority under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) versus the respondents' argument that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) created a comprehensive and exclusive federal framework that implicitly forbids private interim storage.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Federalism Stakes):** My previous uncertainty about whether other states would support Texas has been resolved. Idaho's entry confirms this is not an isolated issue. Idaho presents a compelling narrative: it has hosted federal nuclear activities for decades under a binding 1995 settlement agreement that the federal government would remove all waste by 2035. Idaho argues that licensing private \"temporary\" sites is an unlawful stop-gap that makes it \"inevitable\" the government will breach this agreement, turning Idaho into a *de facto* permanent repository without its consent. This transforms the case from a Texas-specific dispute into a broader federalism conflict about broken promises to states.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Major Questions Doctrine):** Idaho's brief provides powerful ammunition for the respondents' MQD argument. It frames the NRC's licensing decision not as a routine application of existing authority, but as a lawless ad-hoc policy (\"duct tape on a broken window\") that subverts a congressional mandate (Yucca Mountain) and has vast political and economic consequences for multiple states. By citing *West Virginia v. EPA* and highlighting the \"extreme hazards\" of nuclear waste, Idaho reinforces the claim that such a policy requires \"clear congressional authorization,\" which it argues is absent.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Practical & Safety Arguments):** Idaho's brief makes the safety risks more concrete. It recounts its own history with nuclear leaks over the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to 400,000 people. It argues that dispersing waste to numerous private sites increases security risks (theft for \"dirty bombs,\" terrorism) and the likelihood of environmental contamination, contrasting this with the relative safety of a single, secure, permanent geologic repository like Yucca Mountain.\n\n3.  **Resolution of Strategic Uncertainty:** My prior belief state explicitly identified the need to assess amicus support to gauge the real-world stakes. The Idaho brief is a direct hit on this point.\n    *   **Resolved Question:** I now know that other states are indeed supporting Texas, signaling a coordinated concern about federalism and executive branch circumvention of statutory schemes.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** This signal increases the political weight of a ruling against Texas on the merits. It provides justices concerned with states' rights and executive overreach a compelling, real-world narrative to support a decision to affirm the Fifth Circuit.\n\n**Overall Synthesis:** My prediction still slightly favors the petitioners, but with reduced confidence. The strength and clarity of their procedural argument remain their most likely path to victory, offering the Court a clean reversal without touching the messy substantive policy debate. However, the observation of Idaho's amicus brief has substantially strengthened the respondents' case on the merits. The substantive question is no longer a toss-up in my view; the weight of the arguments, particularly on federalism and the Major Questions Doctrine, has shifted in favor of Texas. If the Court chooses to look past the procedural issue and decide the case on its substance, the likelihood of a victory for the respondents has now markedly increased. My next focus will be to see if the petitioners draw support from the nuclear industry or other stakeholders to counter this powerful state-level opposition.",

However, this belief is based on the inference that this coalition will present strong arguments. This action directly tests that inference by examining the content of their briefs. The potential for a significant belief update is high. If the briefs present a unified, compelling federalism and separation-of-powers argument, my assessment of the substantive question will shift decisively toward the respondents, potentially even altering my view on the likelihood of the Court using the procedural 'off-ramp'. Conversely, weak or disjointed arguments would shift my belief back toward the petitioners. This action is therefore critical for refining my prediction. For design, this action provides a valuable case study in how a broad coalition of states, legislators, and ideological groups translates its political opposition into specific legal arguments (e.g., federalism, Major Questions Doctrine) aimed at the Court, which is a highly generalizable insight for future administrative law cases.",

Despite their differences, amici have a \nmutual interest in this case for two reasons. \n \nFirst, amici have a mutual interest in protecting \nthe businesses and property of their members from \nharm. This case concerns a license to store radioactive \nnuclear waste in the Permian Basin, where amici\u2019s \nmembers do business. The license will impede safe oil \nand gas development in one of the largest oilfields in \nthe world and threaten the only freshwater aquifers \nin the region. \nSecond, amici have a mutual interest in protect-\ning the right of their members to a day in court. \nAmici\u2019s members include family businesses that can-\nnot pay Washington lawyers or read the Federal \nRegister on a daily basis. Further, the time to inter-\nvene or comment in agency proceedings is often short, \nsee 83 Fed. Reg. 44,070 (Aug. 29, 2018) (60 days), and \nthe harm not always readily apparent from agency no-\ntices, see Gage v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d \n1214, 1218 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (\u201cThe ultimate impact, or \neven the likelihood of enforcement, of proposed rules \nmay be far from clear.\u201d). The Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission\u2019s argument against judicial review in \nthis case is therefore a recipe for regulatory capture \nand lawlessness. It would favor politically powerful \ninterests with the resources to participate in agency \n \n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and \nno person or entity other than amici or its counsel made a mon-\netary contribution intended to fund its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nproceedings and harm the public interest and the rule \nof law. \nAmici are: \nTHE PERMIAN BASIN PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION \n(\u201cPBPA\u201d). Formed in 1961 by a group of oilmen con-\ncerned about the federal government\u2019s growing \nregulatory role, PBPA has grown from fewer than \ntwenty members to over 1,000 member companies at \nits peak. PBPA represents the interests of exploration \nand production, service, midstream, and various other \nsupport services companies that operate in the Per-\nmian Basin. \nTHE NEW MEXICO FARM AND LIVESTOCK BUREAU. \nFormed in 1917 by New Mexico farmers and ranchers, \nthe New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau is the \nvoice of agriculture in New Mexico, advocating for \nfarm, ranch, and dairy families. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFrom the beginning of the administrative state, \nfederal agencies have argued that there is no general \nlaw of judicial review. The right to review, they say, \nmust be conferred by the text of the review scheme at \nhand. This Court has rebuffed that argument time \nand again. This case should be no different. \n \nFirst, the Fifth Circuit correctly applied the \n\u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine. That doctrine is firmly rooted in \ntraditional principles of equity codified in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), which entitles \na person suffering \u201clegal wrong\u201d to judicial review, \neven if they are not \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved \nby agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. A long line of cases going back \nto the early days of the Interstate Commerce \nCommission (\u201cICC\u201d) applied the ultra vires doctrine in \nsuits brought by parties that did not participate in the \nunderlying agency proceedings but had a legally \nprotected interest at stake. When Congress later \nenacted special statutory review provisions to extend \njudicial review to a broader class of persons \nparticipating in the administrative process, those \nprovisions were not understood to displace equitable \nrights of review, but to supplement them. Here, the \nCommission\u2019s license deprives Texas of a right \nconferred by statute\u2014the State\u2019s right under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act to veto interim-storage \nfacilities. Texas Br. 31. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly applied the ultra vires doctrine. \nSecond, Texas and Fasken are both parties \naggrieved under Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. Relying \nupon a D.C. Circuit decision, the Commission reads \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d to mean a party to the agency \n\n \n4 \n \n \nproceeding. That is wrong. The Hobbs Act\u2019s text, \ncontext, and history demonstrates that the best \nreading of the term \u201cparty\u201d in Section 4 is an entity \nthat files a petition for review in court. Section 3 of the \nAct, for example, unambiguously uses \u201cparty\u201d to mean \npetitioner, and contextual clues and background \nprinciples point in the same direction. Congress did \nnot hide an exhaustion requirement in the words \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  \nRegardless, Fasken is a party because the term \n\u201cparty,\u201d as defined by the APA, is broad enough to \ninclude, at a minimum, an entity that sought to and \nis \u201centitled as of right\u201d to intervene, even though the \nCommission wrongfully denied intervention. See 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 551(3).  \nThird, even if \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d required \nexhaustion, the requirement is not jurisdictional. It \ncreates at most a condition to a right of review that \nequity excuses when, as here, an agency wrongfully \nrefuses intervenor status to an entity legally entitled \nto intervene. Fasken\u2019s multiple attempts to intervene \nshould make Fasken a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d in equity if \nnot in law. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTexas Has a Right to Challenge Ultra Vires \nAgency Action \nThe State of Texas explains that the Nuclear Reg-\nulatory Commission exceeded its authority by \ngranting a license to store nuclear waste away from a \nnuclear reactor in private facilities. The Fifth Circuit \nheld that Texas had a right to bring this \u201cultra vires\u201d \nchallenge even though Texas did not formally inter-\nvene in the licensing proceeding. See Texas v. NRC, 78 \nF.4th 827, 834\u201340 (5th Cir. 2023). \nThe Commission disparages this decision as rest-\ning upon a \u201cjudge-made\u201d exception that is contrary to \n\u201cplain text.\u201d U.S. Br. 20. Specifically, the Commission \nfocuses on one sentence in Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. \nThat sentence provides: \nAny party aggrieved by the final order may, \nwithin 60 days after its entry, file a petition to \nreview the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344. \nAccording to the Commission, the use of the word \n\u201cparty\u201d implies that only a person that intervened in \na licensing proceeding before the agency may seek re-\nview under the Hobbs Act\u2014at least when the agency \nholds a hearing on the record. Cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. Be-\ncause Texas did not formally intervene in the \nlicensing proceeding, the Commission argues, Texas \nwasn\u2019t a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding and cannot invoke \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act. U.S. Br. 16\u201320. \nNor can anybody else, and the Act\u2019s jurisdiction is \u201cex-\nclusive.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Commission further argues that \u201c[n]o one \nhas offered a principled defense of the [ultra vires] ex-\nception, which originated in dicta in a footnote in a \n1982 Fifth Circuit decision and lacks any grounding \nin this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d U.S. Br. 14; see also id. at \n20\u201326; see Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d \n82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982). The upshot would be that \nthe license may \u201center a promised land free from legal \nchallenge.\u201d Herr v. U.S. Forest Serv., 803 F.3d 809, \n821 (6th Cir. 2015) (Sutton, J.). \nThe Commission is wrong. As explained below, \nthe ultra vires doctrine is deeply rooted in the law of \nequity and the text and history of the APA, which \nformed the backdrop of the Hobbs Act\u2019s review \nscheme. Under the APA, persons \u201csuffering legal \nwrong because of agency action\u201d are \u201centitled to judi-\ncial review thereof,\u201d even if they are not otherwise \n\u201cadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action \nwithin the meaning of a relevant statute\u201d\u2014here, the \nHobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. \nThis right codifies a long tradition of \u201cnonstatutory re-\nview\u201d allowing relief in equity for official acts in excess \nof legal authority. \nPersons suffering a legal wrong don\u2019t depend \nupon a right of review created by statute. Their rights \nflow from the law of equity now codified in the APA. \nAs this Court put it in a case involving an ICC order \nreviewed under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913, \nthe immediate predecessor of the Hobbs Act: \nThe contention is that the commission has \nexceeded its statutory powers; and that, \nhence, the order is void. In such a case the \ncourts have jurisdiction of suits to enjoin the \nenforcement of an order, even if the plaintiff \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhas not attempted to secure redress in a \nproceeding before the commission. \nSkinner & Eddy Corp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557, \n562\u201363 (1919) (Brandeis, J.) (citing cases) (emphasis \nadded); see also Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trs. v. \nUnited States, 263 U.S. 143, 147\u201348 (1923) (\u201cThe mere \nfact that plaintiffs were not parties to the proceedings \nin which the order was entered does not constitute a \nbar to this suit. For it is brought to set aside an order \nalleged to be in excess of the Commission\u2019s power.\u201d). \nThere is no evidence that by using the words \u201cparty \naggrieved,\u201d the Hobbs Act meant to impliedly depart \nfrom this precedent and abrogate longstanding rights \nof review in equity codified in the APA\u2019s hard-fought \ntext. \nThe Fifth Circuit footnote the Commission calls \n\u201cdicta\u201d not grounded in precedent cited precedent, in-\ncluding Skinner. See Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 673 F.2d at \n85 n.4. The ultra vires doctrine is thus grounded in \nprecedent. The Commission brushes these precedents \noff as \u201cdecided before Congress brought judicial review \nof ICC orders within the Hobbs Act\u2019s ambit.\u201d U.S. Br. \n23. As discussed below, however, this Court recog-\nnized shortly after the Hobbs Act was enacted that the \nAPA\u2019s general right of review for a person suffering \nlegal wrong applies to cases brought under the Hobbs \nAct. The right of review for a party aggrieved recog-\nnized by the Hobbs Act is thus not exclusive, but \ncomplementary. \nA. The \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Doctrine Is Supported \nby Text, History, and Precedent \nIn a 1944 dissenting opinion, Justice Frankfurter \nargued that \u201c[t]here is no such thing as a common law \n\n \n8 \n \n \nof judicial review in the federal courts.\u201d Stark v. Wick-\nard, 321 U.S. 288, 312 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., \ndissenting). He claimed that the right to review an \nagency action must be found in \u201cthe text and texture \nof a particular law.\u201d Id. That is the view urged by the \nCommission. \nUnfortunately for the Commission, Justice \nFrankfurter\u2019s dissenting view was \u201cneither wholly \nsupported by the case law at that time nor has he been \nsustained by subsequent legislative or judicial devel-\nopments.\u201d Note, Remedies Against the United States \nand Its Officials, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 827, 912 (1957). It \nwas not the law then, and it is not the law now. To \nunderstand why, it is important to start from the very \nbeginning. \n1. Statutory Rights of Review Expanded \non Pre-existing Nonstatutory Rights \nBefore the APA, administrative lawyers classi-\nfied challenges to agency action into two broad forms \nof review. First, \u201cnonstatutory review.\u201d Off. of the \nAtt\u2019y Gen., Final Report of the Attorney General\u2019s \nCommittee on Administrative Procedure 80\u201381 (1941) \n(\u201c1941 AG Report\u201d); Walter Gellhorn & Clark Byse, \nAdministrative Law 218, 223\u201324 (1960). Second, \n\u201cstatutory review.\u201d 1941 AG Report 82\u201383; Gellhorn \n& Byse, supra, at 218\u201323; see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 (\u201cThe \nform of proceeding for judicial review is the special \nstatutory review proceeding \u2026.). \nUnderstanding the Hobbs Act\u2019s right of review for \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requires understanding these two \nforms of review, and how they interact with each \nother. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n\u201cNonstatutory\u201d review. Suits against govern-\nment officials have never been wholly a matter of \ncongressional grace. Well before the APA, plaintiffs \nbrought suits for damages against agency officials, for \nejectment, or for some other remedy at common law or \nequity. 1941 AG Report 80\u201381; see, e.g., United States \nv. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. \n170 (1804). In these cases, officers could always justify \ntheir conduct \u201cby referring to the law under which\u201d \nthe officer \u201cis acting.\u201d 1941 AG Report 81. This raised \n\u201cprecisely the issue whether the law does indeed au-\nthorize [the officer\u2019s] conduct under the circumstances\n\u2014the typical issue for judicial determination.\u201d Id. \n \nBy the 1940s, \u201cthe equity injunction ha[d] become \n\u2026 the common remedy,\u201d along with new actions for \ndeclaratory judgments. Id. These remedies in equity \noccupied \u201ca wide field in Federal administrative law.\u201d \nId. Persons could seek review in equity or declaratory \nrelief \u201cfor the review of major and long-established ac-\ntivities of Government for which no remedy was \nprovided by statute\u201d as well as \u201cwhere the remedy pro-\nvided by statute is not an adequate substitute or does \nnot include the particular situation involved.\u201d Id. at \n81\u201382 & nn.16\u201317 (citing cases); cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703\u2013\n04. \nNot everyone adversely affected by agencies had \na right to sue in equity, however. Harm alone would \nnot sustain a bill in equity or a right to declaratory \nrelief. See Tenn. Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118, \n137\u201338 (1939). \u201cIn equity as at law \u2026 courts recog-\nnized only limited rights of action.\u201d Caleb Nelson, \n\u201cStanding\u201d and Remedial Rights in Administrative \nLaw, 105 Va. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2019). Relief was gen-\nerally available only to prevent a threatened invasion \n\n \n10 \n \n \nof \u201ca legal right\u2014one of property, one arising out of \ncontract, one protected against tortious invasion, or \none founded on a statute which confers a privilege.\u201d \nTenn. Elec. Power Co., 306 U.S. at 137; see also 1941 \nAG Report 84. As one casebook put it, \u201c[t]he most im-\nportant basis of nonstatutory review is the proposition \nthat if an official invades a person\u2019s \u2018legal\u2019 rights\u2014or \nin other words, commits a \u2018legal wrong\u2019\u2014the ordinary \ncourts of the lands should be open to his plea for suit-\nable relief, just as they would be if controversy arose \nbetween two private persons.\u201d Gellhorn & Byse, su-\npra, at 224. \nThere were three categories of legal wrongs se-\ncured through non-statutory forms of review in equity. \nFirst, persons could seek an anti-suit injunction \nto restrain an officer\u2019s wrongful enforcement of an al-\nlegedly unlawful regulation or order. See, e.g., Shields \nv. Utah Idaho Cent. R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183\u201384 \n(1938); Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605, 621 \n(1912). This remedy, however, could be sought only by \n\u201cthe direct targets of regulation.\u201d Nelson, supra, at \n715. \nSecond, persons could seek equitable relief \u201cto \nprevent tortious invasions\u201d of their legal rights by gov-\nernment officials, such as a wrongful interference \nwith land, other property interests, contracts, or busi-\nness. Id. One example of this type of suit is American \nSchool of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94 \n(1902), where this Court allowed a business to chal-\nlenge the Postmaster General\u2019s unlawful decision to \nstop delivering mail to the business\u2014including \n\u201cchecks, drafts, money orders, and money itself\u201d\u2014\nbased upon the Postmaster\u2019s unilateral determination \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthat the business was fraudulent. Id. at 98\u201399, 108\u2013\n110. \nThird, a statute could create a \u201cprivilege\u201d for an \nindividual or a class, which could then be protected \nthrough a suit in equity. Nelson, supra, at 716. This \nCourt\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne, cited by the Fifth \nCircuit, falls into this category, as it concerned a stat-\nutory \u201cright\u201d enjoyed by a group of employees in \nderogation of the common law. 358 U.S. 184, 188\u201389 \n(1958). \nAlthough quite broad, nonstatutory forms of re-\nview left many economic harms unprotected by the \ncourts. For example, businesses would often seek to \nprevent illegal agency actions that permitted compe-\ntition against them. \u201cThe common law,\u201d however, \n\u201cdoes not recognize an interest in freedom from honest \ncompetition.\u201d Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. \nMcGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 153 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring). Harms arising from honest competition \nwere thus routinely dismissed by this Court as \u201cdam-\nnum absque injuria\u201d\u2014harm without a cognizable \ninjury. Tenn. Elec. Power Co., 306 U.S. at 137\u201338; see \nalso Ala. Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464, 478\u201379 \n(1938). \nStatutory Review. Congress sometimes enacts a \nspecific scheme of statutory review and did so many \ntimes before the APA. 1941 AG Report 82\u201383; \nGellhorn & Byse, supra, at 218\u201323.

Rev. 159 \n (1991) ................................................................. 4, 22 \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTERESTS OF AMICI CURIAE \nNew Mexico and Michigan have a strong interest \nin protecting principles of federalism and ensuring \nthat states have recourse to challenge federal agency \ndecisions. This is particularly true when such \ndecisions affect the safety and wellbeing of the people \nwithin their borders. \nAlthough the nuclear industry helps protect and \npower our nation, determining where to store the \nwaste it generates is a difficult question; the improper \nstorage of intensely radioactive nuclear waste would \nbe catastrophic. As such, Amici States have an \nespecially strong interest in deciding whether to allow \nconsolidation of the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel within \ntheir borders.  \nPetitioners advance an unduly limited reading of \n\u201caggrieved party\u201d under the Hobbs Act, contrary to \nCongress\u2019s consent-based siting policy. That policy, \nprovided for by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, ensures, \nin relevant part, that a state have a voice in \ndetermining whether it will host a nuclear waste \nrepository. Petitioners\u2019 cramped reading also fails to \nensure critical state interests are properly considered, \nresults in inconsistent application of the term \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d across agencies, denies review to impacted \nparties who participated in underlying agency \nproceedings, and is ultimately contrary to the clear \nintent of Congress that final agency determinations \nbe subject to judicial review. \nAmici States thus have a strong interest in \nensuring that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s \nactions are subject to judicial review. Amici support \n\n2 \n \n \nRespondents in their efforts to ensure that all \naggrieved parties may challenge agency action.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nDespite the need for a permanent facility to store \nspent nuclear fuel (SNF), such a facility has not yet \nbeen \nbuilt. \nTwo \ncompanies\u2014Interim \nStorage \nPartners, LLC (ISP) and Holtec International, LLC \n(Holtec)\u2014saw a business opportunity in this failure \nand sought to build above-ground storage facilities \nlarge enough to hold all of the nation\u2019s SNF on an \n\u201cinterim\u201d\u2014but effectively indefinite\u2014basis. ISP and \nHoltec chose the Permian Basin of eastern New \nMexico and west Texas, home to the most productive \noil field in the world and one of the nation\u2019s most \nthreatened \naquifers. \nThe \nNuclear \nRegulatory \nCommission (NRC) issued Holtec and ISP licenses to \noperate their facilities on 40-year renewable terms \nover objections from the host states and denied every \nattempt by opponents to intervene in the proceedings. \nRespondents sought judicial review of NRC\u2019s \nactions in the Fifth Circuit, which Petitioners fought \non both jurisdictional and merits grounds. Petitioners \nadvance a definition of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under which \nNRC\u2019s actions effectively deny such status to its \nopponents and thus prevent judicial review. In light of \nNRC\u2019s suffocation of public participation in licensing \nproceedings, Petitioners\u2019 proposed definition of \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d effectively precludes the possibility of \njudicial review of NRC\u2019s final decisions. The Court \nshould not suffer such a misguided and self-interested \nposition, particularly when Congress has made clear \nthat a host state or tribe\u2019s disapproval of a proposed \n\n3 \n \n \nsite controls, unless overruled by Congress. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10135. \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 position, the \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d requirement in the Hobbs Act should be \nread to include all those who participated in the \nproceedings below. This reading accomplishes many \nimportant goals, including (a) satisfying congressional \nintent to subject final agency decisions to judicial \noversight and ensure that parties who are impacted \nby proceedings involving atomic energy and nuclear \nwaste are heard, (b) ensuring proper consideration of \nstates\u2019 critical environmental and safety concerns, \nand (c) preventing NRC\u2019s restrictive regulations from \nrendering meaningful challenge to agency action \npractically impossible. \nAlternatively, when NRC has exceeded its \nstatutory authority as it has in this case, a state \nshould be able to seek judicial review of NRC decisions \nunder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s established ultra vires \nexception. New Mexico and Michigan support and \necho Respondents\u2019 request to affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvacatur of ISP\u2019s license and urge the same affirmance \nof the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision on Holtec. \nARGUMENT \nCongress delegated to NRC the authority to license \nnuclear facilities and regulate their safety. In doing \nso, Congress struck an important balance: it gave \nNRC \u201ca virtually unique substantive freedom\u201d to \nresolve nuclear safety issues in exchange for \u201ca \nvirtually unique procedural responsibility\u201d to admit \ninterested parties to its proceedings and ensure \njudicial review. Richard Goldsmith, Regulatory \nReform & the Revival of Nuclear Power, 20 Hofstra L. \n\n4 \n \n \nRev. 159, 163-64 (1991). Indeed, NRC has a statutory \nduty to allow \u201cany person whose interest may be \naffected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under Chapter 23 of the \nAtomic Energy Act (AEA) to request and participate \nin a hearing, and thus become a \u201cparty to such \nproceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A) (emphases \nadded).  \nInstead of allowing all such interested parties to \nparticipate in its proceedings, however, NRC has \npromulgated an impenetrable thicket of procedural \nregulations, making intervention and participation in \nhearings all-but-impossible. Petitioners exacerbate \nthis problem by narrowly interpreting the Hobbs Act \nto permit only intervenors to seek redress in the Court \nof Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344; NRC Br. 13-14; ISP Br. \n16. Such an interpretation frustrates Congress\u2019s \ncommands that \u201c[a]ny final order entered in any \nproceeding\u201d\u2014including those at issue here\u2014\u201cshall be \nsubject to judicial review,\u201d1 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) \n(emphasis added), and that \u201cany person whose \ninterest may be affected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under \nthe AEA should be heard, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A).  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s determination that it had \njurisdiction to review NRC\u2019s statutory authority to \n \n1 Contrary to NRC\u2019s suggestion, the NRC licensing \nprocess is not \u201cakin to litigation between two parties\u201d (NRC Br. \nat 27), nor is it an adversarial process. In an adversarial process, \njudicial review is ensured by the losing party\u2019s ability to \nchallenge the outcome. But in a licensing proceeding before NRC, \nunless intervention has been granted to a petitioner opposing the \nlicense, there is no losing party once NRC accepts the \napplication. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nmake the relevant siting decisions was correct, and its \ndecision should be affirmed.  \nI. THE \nCOURT \nSHOULD \nREAD \n\u201cPARTY \nAGGRIEVED\u201d \nIN \nLINE \nWITH \nCONGRESSIONAL INTENT, NOT NRC\u2019S \nARTIFICIALLY RESTRICTED VIEW.  \nA. Congress Intended \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d to \nInclude Anyone Aggrieved by a Final \nOrder, \nAcross \nAgencies \nand \nAdministrations.  \nCongress clearly stated that \u201c[a]ny final order \nentered in any proceeding\u201d \u201cshall be subject to judicial \nreview.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b)(1). Congress similarly \ncommanded that \u201cany person whose interest may be \naffected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under the AEA should \nbe heard. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A).   \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly noted that \u201cthe function \nof the \u2018party aggrieved\u2019 status requirement is to \nensure that the agency had the opportunity to \nconsider the issue that petitioners are concerned \nwith.\u201d \nPet.App.17a \n(emphasis \nadded). \nIndeed, \n\u201cexecutive determinations generally are subject to \njudicial review,\u201d as is evident by the strong \n\u201cpresumption \nfavoring \njudicial \nreview \nof \nadministrative action.\u201d Gerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020) (citations omitted); see also \nLeedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190 (1958) (\u201cThis Court \ncannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend \njudicial protection of rights it confers against agency \naction taken in excess of delegated powers.\u201d); Dart v. \nUnited States, 848 F.2d 217, 221 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (\u201cIf \nthe wording of a preclusion clause is less than \nabsolute, . . . [j]udicial review is favored when an \n\n6 \n \n \nagency is charged with acting beyond its authority.\u201d); \ncf. Kirby Corp. v. Pe\u00f1a, 109 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir. \n1997) (noting that \u201cthe government bears a \u2018heavy \nburden\u2019 when arguing that Congress meant to \nprohibit all judicial review\u201d). \nIn short, if the agency had a chance to consider the \nissues now on review, then the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nstatus requirement has served its purpose. See Gage \nv. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1219 \n(D.C. Cir. 1973) (\u201cThe \u2018party\u2019 status requirement \noperates to preclude direct appellate court review \nwithout a record which at least has resulted from the \nfact-finder\u2019s focus on the alternative regulatory \nprovisions which petitioners propose.\u201d); ACA Int\u2019l v. \nFCC, 885 F.3d 687, 711-12 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(emphasizing the centrality of having presented a \nview to the agency to qualify as an aggrieved party). \nAs such, reading \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d to include those \nwho participated in agency proceedings and whose \ninterests may be affected by that agency\u2019s final orders \nsatisfies congressional intent. This question has \nrecurred across agencies and administrations, and \nmany courts have settled on this same reading. See, \ne.g., Massachusetts v. United States, 522 F.3d 115, 131 \n(1st Cir. 2008) (stating that whether one is a party \naggrieved for Hobbs Act purposes depends on whether \n\u201cthe would-be petitioner \u2018directly and actually \nparticipated in the administrative proceedings\u2019\u201d \n(quoting Clark & Reid Co. v. United States, 804 F.2d \n3, 5 (1st Cir. 1986))); Reytblatt v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Comm\u2019n, 105 F.3d 715, 720 (D.C. Cir. \n1997) (\u201cPetitioners clearly [enjoy \u2018party\u2019 status] \nbecause each participated in the Commission\u2019s \ninformal rulemaking by filing comments.\u201d); Nat\u2019l \n\n7 \n \n \nAss\u2019n of State Util. v. FCC, 457 F.3d 1238, 1250 (11th \nCir. 2006) (holding that entities that \u201cparticipated in \nthe proceedings by submitting comments and notice of \nex \nparte \ncommunications \n. . . \nindependently \nestablished their status as \u2018part[ies] aggrieved\u2019\u201d), \nopinion modified on denial of reh\u2019g, 468 F.3d 1272 \n(11th Cir. 2006); Am. C.L. Union v. FCC, 774 F.2d 24, \n26 (1st Cir. 1985) (observing that entities had the \nchance to \u201cparticipate in the proceedings or review \nprocess as individual parties\u201d if they had \u201cfiled \ncomments with the agency or petitioned for \nreconsideration of the FCC\u2019s final order\u201d); cf. Simmons \nv. Interstate Com. Comm\u2019n, 716 F.2d 40, 42, 45 (D.C. \nCir. 1983) (analyzing, not whether entity was a \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d as to the proceeding they had submitted \ncomments on, but whether entity was a \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d as to a related proceeding they had not \nsubmitted comments on). Amici urge the Court to do \nthe same here. \nFurther, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 arguments, \u201cthe \nregulatory definition of a \u2018party\u2019 in an [agency] \nproceeding\u201d should not be equated \u201cwith the \nparticipatory party status required for judicial review \nunder the Hobbs Act.\u201d Clark, 804 F.2d at 6 . The Court \nis not \u201cbound by [NRC]\u2019s description of [an] entity as \na party.\u201d Balderas v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 59 \nF.4th 1112, 1117 (10th Cir. 2023). Rather, the power \nto construe who is a \u201cparty\u201d to a Hobbs Act petition is \nreserved for the Court. See Clark, 804 F.2d at 6. And \nit is for Congress, not an agency, to strip federal courts \nof the power of such review. See Kucana v. Holder, 558 \nU.S. 233, 251-52 (2010).  \nHere, Texas participated in NRC\u2019s proceedings by \nsubmitting comments on the draft Environmental \n\n8 \n \n \nImpact Statement (EIS), and Fasken participated by \nattempting intervention. NRC certainly had plenty of \nopportunities to consider the issues that aggrieved \nFasken, Texas, and other commentors.2 Texas and \nFasken are \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under a plain \nlanguage reading of the Hobbs Act and in accordance \nwith congressional intent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344; see also, \ne.g., Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, & Transp. \nWorkers v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 988 F.3d 1170, 1177-78 \n(9th 2021) (finding that States were \u201cparties \naggrieved\u201d when state agencies submitted comments \nto federal agency).  \nAlthough the Fifth Circuit ultimately did not \ndecide whether Texas was a \u201cparty aggrieved,\u201d it \nindicated \nits \nagreement \nwith \nthis \nreading. \nPet.App.17a-18a. And as the Fifth Circuit observed in \ndenying en banc review, allowing NRC to \u201ccontrol[] \nthe courthouse door\u201d by confining access to judicial \nreview to successful intervenors would violate \nfundamental principles governing review of agency \ndecisions. Pet.App.34a. NRC\u2019s suggested definition of \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act\u2014under which \nonly license applicants and successful intervenors \nqualify\u2014would permit NRC\u2019s own overly-restrictive \nprocedural standards for intervention to bar judicial \nreview of its actions. A plain language reading in \naccordance with congressional intent is far superior. \n \n2 This is particularly so when the NWPA requires \nconsultation with states on SNF issues, and Texas attempted to \nprovide such consultation. See Pet.App.40a (\u201c[T]he NWPA \nspecifically required \u2018consultation\u2019 with the states before siting of \n[SNF] may occur anywhere.\u201d (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10155(d)(1)-(2))). \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nB. This \nReading \nEnsures \nProper \nConsideration \nof \nImportant \nState \nInterests. \nIn addition, this plain reading allows for \nconsideration of serious environmental and safety \nconcerns regarding the proposed \u201cinterim\u201d SNF \nstorage facilities at issue here.  \nIn the present context, the narrow reading \nadvanced by Petitioners would preclude proper \nconsideration of the serious concerns raised by Texas, \nFasken, New Mexico, and others affected by siting \ndeterminations for SNF facilities. Affected parties \ntried to raise concerns in the NRC proceedings, but \nNRC overrode host states\u2019 and others\u2019 concerns and \nissued the licenses. This is a final determination that \nshould be subject to judicial review.  \nParticularly concerning to Amici, Texas, New \nMexico, and other entities raised various concerns \nwith licensing SNF storage facilities in the Permian \nBasin due to its unsuitable geology, valuable \nresources, and national security risk. They also \nsubmitted comments on the draft EIS in the Holtec \nand ISP licensing proceedings covering the gamut of \nsafety, environmental, economic, and social issues, \ndiscussed below. New Mexico even attempted to \naddress its concerns through collaboration with NRC \nin the Holtec proceedings by entering into a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) with NRC (at \nNRC\u2019s invitation) to assist it with preparation of the \nHoltec EIS. See MOU between NMED and NRC \n(dated \nJuly \n24, \n2019), \navailable \nat \n\n10 \n \n \nhttps://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1920/ML19206A094.pdf. \nNMED provided comments on working versions of \nNRC\u2019s draft EIS per the MOU, including raising \nconcerns about the inadequacy of EIS\u2019s analysis of \ngroundwater and geology issues around the site. As \nwith other comments and objections submitted to \nNRC, these were ignored.  \nNRC\u2019s decision to license the facilities over such \nobjections violated Congress\u2019s command that a host \nstate or tribe\u2019s disapproval of a proposed site controls, \nunless overruled by Congress. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10135. \nFederal courts must be able to step in and reverse \nNRC when it acts contrary to congressional intent. \nThis is all the more important when dealing with \nsome of the serious and substantial concerns that \nwere raised\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n22: 20250122154410051_Certificate20of20Compliance20with20Word20Limitations.json (score: 0.444)\nNos. 23-1300, 23-1312 \n \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n______________ \nNUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION, et al., Petitioners, \nv. \nSTATE OF TEXAS, et al., Respondents. \n_______________ \nINTERIM STORAGE PARTNERS, LLC, Petitioner, \nv. \nSTATE OF TEXAS, et al., Respondents. \n________________ \nOn Writs of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit \n_______________ \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH WORD LIMITATIONS \n______________ \n \nPursuant to Supreme Court Rule 33(h), I hereby certify that the Brief of \nPermian Basin Petroleum Association and New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau \nas Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents contains 7,806 words, excluding parts of \nthe document exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

PLF is the most expe-\nrienced public-interest legal organization defending \nthe constitutional principle of separation of powers in \nthe arena of administrative law. \nPLF currently represents a client whose access to \njudicial review would be denied under the govern-\nment\u2019s self-serving interpretation of the Hobbs Act.  \nSee theDove Media, Inc. v. Fed. Commc\u2019n Comm\u2019n, No. \n24-60407 (5th Cir.).  More broadly, PLF is interested \nin preventing agencies from manipulating adminis-\ntrative procedures to evade judicial scrutiny.  See, e.g., \nSackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120 (2012) (denying agency\u2019s \nuse of pre-enforcement compliance orders to escape re-\nview). \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reads \nthe Hobbs Act to limit judicial review to those who for-\nmally participated in the underlying licensing pro-\nceeding.  Yet this access comes only with the NRC\u2019s \npermission and, indeed, the agency closely regulates \nthird-party intervention into its adjudications.  If the \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and that no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, and its counsel, made any monetary contribution \ntoward the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n \n2 \n \ngovernment\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act is ac-\ncepted, then \u201cthe NRC controls the courthouse door \nthrough its authority to determine who may be \u2018par-\nties\u2019 to licensing proceedings.\u201d Texas v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 95 F.4th 935, 936 (5th Cir. 2024) (Jones, J., \nconcurring in denial of en banc rehearing).  \nAmicus shows how the NRC, in practice, exercises \nsignificant discretionary authority over entry to its in-\nhouse tribunals and, by extension, the availability of \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act.  Regardless of \nwhether it amounts to an intentional strategy, the \nNRC is suppressing judicial review of purely legal \nquestions that speak directly to its own power.  \nAmicus urges this Court to reject the government\u2019s \nself-serving construction of the Hobbs Act and instead \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding of the stat-\nute\u2019s \u201cplain text.\u201d See Texas v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 78 F.4th 827, 838 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[T]he \nplain text of the Hobbs Act requires only that a peti-\ntioner have participated\u2014in some way\u2014in the agency \nproceedings, which Texas did through comments and \nFasken did by seeking intervention and filing conten-\ntions.\u201d).  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe \nNRC \nControls \nAccess \nto \nIts \nAdjudications and, by Extension, the \nAvailability of Judicial Review for Purely \nLegal Questions \nIn every NRC licensing proceeding, the applicant is \nthe central party, and the agency\u2019s staff also has a \nright to formally participate.  See 10 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 2.1202(b). For the rest of the public, however, there \nis no intervention of right. See BPI v. Atomic Energy \nComm\u2019n, 502 F.2d 424, 428 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (finding \n\n \n3 \n \nthat the Atomic Energy Act \u201cdoes not confer the auto-\nmatic right of intervention\u201d).  Instead, the operative \nstatute requires admission for any person \u201cwhose in-\nterest may be affected.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a).  The \nNRC interprets the phrase, \u201cwhose interest may be af-\nfected,\u201d as an implicit delegation of authority to deny \nintervention to those with insufficient \u201cinterest\u201d in the \nproceeding.  See BPI v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 502 \nF.2d at 429 (sustaining the agency\u2019s implied authority \nto \u201cnarro[w] those within the larger class to those en-\ntitled to participate as intervenors\u201d).  On this equivo-\ncal legal basis, the NRC closely regulates public access \nto its adjudications.  \nPractically speaking, the NRC controls access to its \nproceedings with heightened pleading requirements. \nSee 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309.  These pleading standards were \ndeveloped by the NRC through multiple amendments \nto its rules of practice, resulting in today\u2019s robust re-\ngime for restricting public access to NRC proceedings.  \nSee 33 Fed. Reg. 8,588 (June 12, 1968) (enhancing \nspecificity requirements); 37 Fed. Reg. 15,132 (July \n28, 1972) (adding criteria by which the NRC could \ndeny intervention); 54 Fed. Reg. 33,168 (Aug. 11, \n1989) (adding materiality and broadening specificity \nrequirements); 72 Fed. Reg. 49,474 (Aug. 28, 2007) \n(enhancing specificity requirements); see also Union of \nConcerned Scientists v. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 920 \nF.2d 50 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (upholding 1989 amend-\nments).  These standards \u201c[are] strict by design.\u201d  See \nIn re Dominion Nuclear Conn., Inc. (Millstone Nuclear \nPower Station, Units 2 & 3), 54 N.R.C. 349, 358 (2001).  \nAccording to one scholar, \u201cthe central thrust\u201d of the \nNRC\u2019s pleading rules \u201c[is] to make intervention and \nparticipation in the Commission\u2019s licensing proceed-\nings more difficult.\u201d  Richard Goldsmith, Regulatory \n\n \n4 \n \nReform and the Revival of Nuclear Power, 20 Hofstra \nL. Rev. 159, 191 (1991).  \nThis heightened pleading standard imposes two \nburdens.  The first is a requirement that a petitioner \nfor intervention establish administrative standing. \nSee 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309(d).  The agency\u2019s rules do not \nspecify a standard to guide the assessment of admin-\nistrative standing. Instead, the NRC has developed its \nown body of standing law, though the agency looks to \n\u201ccontemporaneous judicial concepts\u201d for guidance.  See \nIn re Fla. Power & Light Co. (Turkey Point Nuclear \nGenerating Plant, Units 3 & 4), 82 N.R.C. 389, 394 \n(2015).  Pursuant to this in-house doctrine, a peti-\ntioner can establish administrative standing based on \neither judicial concepts or a geographic presumption \nfor those living within 50 miles of the nuclear power \nplant in question.  See In re Interim Storage Partners \nLLC (WCS Consol. Interim Storage Facility), 90 \nN.R.C. 31, 47-48 (Aug. 23, 2019) (explaining agency\u2019s \nstanding analysis).  But a petitioner who establishes \neither or both circumstances is not ensured interven-\ntion.  Ultimately, the decision rests with the agency, \nwhich can deny administrative standing for a person \nwho would otherwise meet the requirements for Arti-\ncle III standing.  See Envirocare of Utah, Inc. v. Nu-\nclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 194 F.3d 72, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(\u201cThe [NRC] . . . is not an Article III court and thus is \nnot bound to follow the law of standing.\u201d) \nIn addition to demonstrating administrative stand-\ning to the NRC\u2019s satisfaction, the petitioner must also \nsubmit at least one viable \u201ccontention\u201d that sets forth \nan issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.  See \n10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309(f).  A contention must satisfy six cri-\nteria, including that it is \u201cmaterial,\u201d falls within the \nproceeding\u2019s \u201cscope,\u201d and demonstrates a \u201cgenuine \n\n \n5 \n \ndispute.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(i)-(vii).  Under the NRC\u2019s \nrules, failure to satisfy even one of the requirements \nrequires the NRC to reject the contention.  See Entergy \nNuclear Operations, Inc. (Indian Point, Unit 2), 83 \nN.R.C. 131, 136 (2016).  Of course, each of these \nthreshold limits is subject to interpretation, resulting \nin copious discretion for the NRC to deny petitions to \nintervene. See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm\u2019n, 823 F.3d 641, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cIf \na party\u2019s contentions do not meet the Commission\u2019s \nspecificity or relevancy requirements, the agency may \ndeny the hearing request.\u201d).  \nThe agency\u2019s pleading standards have no analogue \nin any other agency covered by the Hobbs Act.  See \nDean Hansell, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Pro-\nceedings:  A Guide for Intervenors, 3 UCLA J. of Env\u2019t \nL. and Pol\u2019y 23, n.56 (1982) (\u201cNo other federal regula-\ntory agency has a contention requirement[.]\u201d).  The \nSurface Transportation Board, for example, requires \nonly that a petition to intervene sets out \u201cpetitioner\u2019s \ninterest,\u201d its \u201crequest . . . for relief,\u201d and a statement \nsupporting or opposing the underlying action.  See 49 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1112.4. \nIn the licensing proceeding below, the agency\u2019s \npleading standards proved insurmountable.  The \nNRC\u2019s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied in-\ntervenor status to most (7 of 11) petitioners (or joint \npetitioners) based on administrative standing.  See In \nre Interim Storage Partners, 90 N.R.C. at 50-51.  The \nNRC declined to hear these standing questions on ap-\npeal, because the agency ultimately affirmed the \nBoard\u2019s denial of all remaining contentions. See In re \nInterim Storage Partners LLC (WCS Consol. Interim \nStorage Facility), 92 N.R.C. 463, 478-79 (Dec. 17, \n\n \n6 \n \n2020).  These rejected contentions included purely le-\ngal arguments that mirror the statutory claims now \nbefore this Court, See id. at 467-68 (denying conten-\ntion that the license violates the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct).  In this manner, the NRC denied all third-party \nparticipation.  \nAlthough courts may review the NRC\u2019s decisions \ndenying intervention, this review provides no real con-\nstraint on the agency\u2019s control over public access to its \nadjudications. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239.  In these cases, \nthe only question before a court is whether the NRC \nabused its discretion in denying intervention, which \nentails a highly deferential standard of review.  See 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council v. \nU.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 823 F.3d at 655 (affirm-\ning NRC\u2019s \u201creasonable determination\u201d to deny inter-\nvention); Blue Ridge Env\u2019t Def. League v. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm\u2019n, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (2013) (holding that \nthe NRC \u201cacted reasonably in denying Petitioners\u2019 \ncontentions\u201d).  \nHere, the underlying proceeding perfectly illus-\ntrates the limitations of judicial review as a check on \nthe agency\u2019s control over access to its adjudications.  \nAfter the NRC denied all petitions to intervene, sev-\neral petitioners sought review in the D.C. Circuit, \nwhich consolidated the challenges.  Framing the ques-\ntion as \u201cwhether the [NRC] reasonably applied its \nhearing regulations,\u201d the D.C. Circuit sustained the \nagency in a cursory and unpublished opinion.  See \nDon\u2019t Waste Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, No. \n21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *2-*3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, \n2023).  Given the evident permissiveness of abuse-of-\ndiscretion review in this context, it follows that the \nNRC wields effective control over public participation \nbefore its tribunals\u2014and, therefore, control over who \n\n \n7 \n \nmay later obtain judicial review of the agency\u2019s sub-\nstantive decisions. \nIn sum, the government argues that \u201conly a \u2018party\u2019 \nto the agency proceeding may seek judicial review of \nCommission orders\u201d under the Hobbs Act, Pet. Br. at \n19, yet the NRC controls access to its proceedings.  \nThe NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act, when com-\nbined with its discretionary authority over adminis-\ntrative intervention, leaves the agency with signifi-\ncant discretion to shield its adjudicative orders from \njudicial review.  \nII.  The NRC Prevents Percolation of Purely \nLegal Questions Regarding the Agency\u2019s \nPurported Power \nThese concerns are not merely hypothetical.  Irre-\nspective of its actual intentions, the NRC is precluding \ncourts from scrutinizing purely legal questions re-\ngarding its purported statutory authority.   \nAn example will elucidate this point. Since the Nu-\nclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) changed the course of \nnational policy on the storage of spent nuclear fuel, \nthe NRC has issued three licenses like the one at issue \nin this case, involving the private storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel at new sites located away from the reactor.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. 30,801 (May 12, 2023) (granting li-\ncense to Holtec International to operate in New Mex-\nico); 86 Fed. Reg. 51,926 (Sept. 17, 2021) (granting li-\ncense to Interim Storage Partners, LLC to operate in \nTexas); 67 Fed. Reg. 18,253 (Apr. 15, 2002) (granting \nlicense to Private Fuel Storage L.L.C. to operate in \nUtah); see also Texas v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, \n78 F.4th 827, 832-33 (5th Cir. 2023) (explaining \nNWPA).  In the first proceeding, more than two dec-\nades ago, the NRC agreed to hear a contention that \n\n \n8 \n \nthe NWPA conflicted with the agency\u2019s asserted au-\nthority.  See Priv. Fuel Storage L.L.C., 55 N.R.C. 260, \n264-65 (Apr. 3, 2002).  Although the NRC ultimately \ngranted the license, the adversely affected party still \nhad recourse to meaningful judicial review on this \nNWPA question.  See Bullcreek v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 359 F.3d 536, 542-43 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \nHowever, in the two more recent proceedings, in-\ncluding the one underlying this case, the NRC refused \nto hear this same purely legal \u201ccontention\u201d that the \nNWPA conflicts with the agency\u2019s purported author-\nity.  See In re Holtec Int\u2019l (HI-STORE Consol. Interim \nStorage Facility), 91 N.R.C. 167, 173-76 (Apr. 23, \n2020); In re Interim Storage Partners, 90 N.R.C. at 56-\n59.  In both instances, the D.C. Circuit upheld the \nNRC\u2019s denial of intervention in a deferential opinion \nthat failed to seriously address the challengers\u2019 statu-\ntory arguments.  See Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. U.S. Nu-\nclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 113 F. 4th 956 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(upholding denial of intervention in Holtec proceed-\ning); Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, No. 21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *2-*3 (D.C. \nCir. Jan. 25, 2023) (affirming denial in Interim Stor-\nage Partners proceeding).  After the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed the agency\u2019s denials of intervention, the NWPA \nissue was removed from the jurisdiction of all courts \nthat accept the NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act.  \nBy regulating access to its proceedings, the NRC thus \nsuppressed lower court percolation of this serious stat-\nutory question regarding its own authority. \nUnder the NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act, \nthe agency can regulate the availability of judicial re-\nview for its licensing decisions, as discussed above.  \nHowever, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act \n\u201cmay vary depending on the type of agency proceeding \n\n \n9 \n \ninvolved.\u201d See Pet Br. at 28.  For informal rules, it is \ncomparatively easier to become a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nunder the Hobbs Act; it is \u201cenough\u201d to submit a com-\nment. See ibid.  The NRC, therefore, wields far less \ncontrol over judicial review of its rulemakings than it \ndoes for its adjudications.  This dichotomy encourages \nthe agency to employ adjudicative procedures, even \nwhere an inclusive rulemaking clearly is more appro-\npriate.  C.f. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947) (\u201c[T]he choice made between \nproceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc lit-\nigation is one that lies primarily in the informed dis-\ncretion of the administrative agency.\u201d).  \nIt is fair to wonder if this perverse incentive is at \nwork at the NRC.  After the failure of the Yucca Moun-\ntain repository roiled national policy, good governance \nprinciples seemingly would call for the NRC to exer-\ncise its generic rulemaking authority to update its \nstorage regulations, which are 45 years old.  See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(p) (rulemaking authority); 45 Fed. Reg. \n74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980) (promulgating current storage \nrules). A participatory process would seem especially \nwarranted, given the obvious nationwide implica-\ntions. Yet instead of conducting a rulemaking, the \nNRC has formulated its post-Yucca storage policy \nthrough two case-by-case licensing proceedings, in-\ncluding the one at issue in this controversy.  While the \nNRC\u2019s preference for adjudications makes little sense \nfrom a good governance perspective, it makes perfect \nsense from a public choice perspective.

The United States requests the following division \nof argument time:  20 minutes for the federal petitioners,1 10 \n \n1 \nThe federal parties are the United States Nuclear Regu-\nlatory Commission and the United States.  They are the petitioners \nin No. 23-1300. \n\n2 \n \nminutes for the private petitioner, Interim Storage Partners \n(ISP),2 and 30 minutes for respondents.3  We respectfully request \nthat the federal petitioners be allowed to open the argument and \nto present rebuttal.  Counsel for ISP has agreed to this motion.   \n \nThese consolidated cases arise out of petitions for court of \nappeals review filed by respondents, alleging that the United \nStates Nuclear Regulatory Commission exceeded its statutory au-\nthority by granting a license that would permit ISP to store spent \nnuclear fuel away from the site of a nuclear reactor.  Pet. App. \n9a.  ISP intervened on the side of the federal petitioners \u201cto \nrepresent its interest[]\u201d in its license.  Ibid.  The court held \nthat respondents had permissibly petitioned for review under an \nultra vires exception to the requirement in the Hobbs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. 2341 et seq., that only \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d may seek \njudicial review of agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2344.  Pet. App. 18a-\n20a.  The court also held that the Commission lacks statutory \nauthority to license offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel.  Id. \nat 21a-30a.  The court vacated the license that the Commission had \ngranted to ISP.  Id. at 30a. \n \n2  \nISP is the petitioner in No. 23-1312. \n3  \nRespondents are the State of Texas; Greg Abbott, Gover-\nnor of the State of Texas; the Texas Commission on Environmental \nQuality; Fasken Land and Minerals, Limited; and Permian Basin Land \nand Royalty Owners.  They are respondents in both of the consoli-\ndated cases. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe federal petitioners and ISP filed separate petitions for \na writ of certiorari seeking review of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision.  The questions before the Court are:  (1) whether the Hobbs \nAct, which authorizes a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by an agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \norder\u201d to petition for review in a court of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \n2344, allows nonparties to obtain review of claims asserting that \nan agency order exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority; and (2) \nwhether the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., and \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq., \npermit the Commission to license private entities to temporarily \nstore spent nuclear fuel away from the nuclear reactor sites where \nthe spent fuel was generated. \n \nDividing the argument time for petitioners between the fed-\neral petitioners and ISP would be of material assistance to this \nCourt.  The federal petitioners have a substantial interest in \nthese cases because they were named respondents in the court of \nappeals; because they have a significant interest in the correct \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement, \nwhich provides the basis for review of actions taken by numerous \nagencies; and because they have important interests in protecting \nthe Commission\u2019s statutory authority to issue licenses under the \nAtomic Energy Act and the Policy Act.  ISP also has a substantial \ninterest in these cases because it intervened as a respondent in \n\n4 \n \nthe court of appeals and because the court vacated ISP\u2019s license \nto store spent nuclear fuel.   \n \nWe accordingly request that the Court grant the motion for \ndivided argument. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \n \n ELIZABETH B.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac.

That \nwould mean an extension of 40 days in No. 23-1300 and an extension of 37 days in \nNo. 23-1312.  The certiorari petition in No. 23-1300 was filed and docketed on June \n12, 2024; the certiorari petition in No. 23-1312 was filed on June 12, 2024, and it \nwas docketed on June 14, 2024.  Without the requested extensions, the brief in \nresponse for each case would be due on July 12 and July 15, respectively.     \n \nThe requested extensions to file a response to the certiorari petitions are \nnecessary to allow undersigned counsel time to review each of the multiple petitions \nand to prepare a joint response.  Also, if the extensions are applied to all respondents \nin both cases, that will result in both cases being set on the same briefing track.  \nFurther, the requested extensions will not delay the Court\u2019s consideration of the \npetitions, which would take place at the conference the week of September 30, 2024, \nwith or without the requested extensions. \n \nCounsel for the Texas state entities (respondents in both Nos. 23-1300 and \n23-1312) join in this request for extensions.   \n\n \n \n \nHon.

Box 2910 \nAustin, Texas 78768 \n \nDear Governor Dewhurst and Speaker Straus: \nEnclosed is a report completed at my request by the \nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  \nThis report evaluates the challenges posed by spent nu-\nclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste (to-\ngether \u201cHLW\u201d) currently stored on-site at the six Texas \nnuclear reactors. \nIn light of recent developments regarding the interim \nstorage and disposal of HLW by the federal govern-\nment, Texas now faces the very real possibility that it \n\n2 \n \nwill have to find a solution to the long-term issue of safe \nand secure handling of this waste.  The citizens of Texas \n\u2014and every other state currently storing radioactive \nwaste\u2014have been betrayed by their federal govern-\nment after contributing billions of dollars to fund a fed-\neral solution for HLW disposal, because a federal solu-\ntion still does not exist. \nSince the U.S. Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act in 1982, each state, including Texas, has been \nassured that the federal government would take posses-\nsion and provide a disposal solution for any HLW gen-\nerated within its borders.  In 1987, the federal govern-\nment identified Yucca Mountain in Nevada as being the \nultimate disposal option with a completion date in 1998.  \nAfter extensive litigation, delays and cost overruns, in \n2009 President Obama abandoned any further develop-\nment of Yucca Mountain and Congress ceased all fund-\ning in 2011 after more than $15 billion had been spent \ncharacterizing and developing the site. \nEarly in 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy an-\nnounced that it was developing a new plan to replace \nYucca Mountain\u2014estimating that an HLW disposal so-\nlution would not be available until 2048.  However, in \nNovember 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia determined that the federal govern-\nment has \u201cno credible plan\u201d to dispose of HLW. \n2048, or whatever year Washington forecasts that a so-\nlution will be provided, is too long to wait. \nI believe it is time for Texas to act, particularly since \nNew Mexico is seeking to be federally designated for \nHLW disposal.  The New Mexico proposed site is ap-\nproximately 50 miles from the Texas border, and we \nmust ensure our citizens are protected.  We have no \n\n3 \n \nchoice but to begin looking for a safe and secure solution \nfor HLW in Texas\u2014a solution that would allow the cit-\nizens of Texas to recoup some of the more than $700 mil-\nlion they have paid toward addressing this issue. \nI hope the enclosed report will be sent to the appropri-\nate oversight committees in your chamber.  The leader-\nship at TCEQ understands the importance of this issue, \nand I believe they will be a valued resource as we con-\ntinue to develop a Texas solution for the long-term res-\nolution of HLW currently residing inside our borders. \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n/s/  \nRICK PERRY \nRICK PERRY  \n \n \nGovernor \nRP:mmp \nEnclosure \n \n \n\n4 \n \nTexas Commission on Environmental  \nQuality Program Report for the September 19, 2014 \nTRAB Meeting \nLow-level radioactive waste disposal:  On August 28, \nTCEQ issued Amendment No. 26 to RML R04100 as a \nmajor amendment.  The amendment 1) revised the per-\nformance assessment, 2) adjusted the amount of finan-\ncial assurance required, and 3) increased the licensed \nvolume of the compact disposal facility.  Waste Control \nSpecialists is now authorized under the license to accept \nall Class A, B, and C low-level radioactive waste for dis-\nposal, including depleted uranium in concentrations \ngreater than 10 nanocuries/gram. \nUranium Mining: \nMajor amendments for license area expansion at two in \nsitu uranium mining licenses were declared technically \ncomplete in July and August.  Public notice was pub-\nlished in the Falfurrias Facts on August 7, 2014 for the \nMeste\u00f1a Alta Mesa Project, with the comment period \nending on September 8, 2014.  Public notice for the \nSouth Texas Mining Venture Palangana Project will be \npublished soon.  A major amendment application from \nSignal Equities for a license area expansion on their \nBrown Project and a new license application from UEC \nfor their Burke Hollow project are both currently under \ntechnical review. \nTCEQ had begun working towards obtaining partial re-\nlease from the NRC of a portion of the former licensed \narea of the abandoned IEC Lamprecht/Zamzow site.  \nOn August 12, 2014, a team of 14 TCEQ field workers \nalong with 3 individuals from DSHS began gamma sur-\nveys and soil sampling in support of an effort to release \n\n5 \n \nnon-operational areas for unrestricted use.  Using GPS \ndata units coupled to survey meters, 2-man teams col-\nlected data across 775 acres in a portion of the formerly \nlicensed area.  Two more field days are currently \nplanned to finish data collection.  When all data have \nbeen collected and analyzed, a Completion Review Re-\nport will be written and submitted to the NRC for their \nconcurrence in a partial release of these areas for unre-\nstricted use.  TCEQ has also initiated its contracting \nprocess to be able to contract for the clean-up of the op-\nerational portion of this site. \nBy-product material disposal:  Operation of the byprod-\nuct waste disposal facility continues under its current \nlicense.  By license condition, the byproduct disposal op-\neration is limited to receiving only the Fernald byprod-\nuct waste.  Staff members continue to review WCS\u2019s en-\nvironmental monitoring reports and related data. \nUnderground Injection Control:  TCEQ is processing \ntwo applications for new Class III UIC permits for in \nsitu uranium mining and one application for expansion \nof the permit area of an existing in situ uranium mining \nsite.  One of the new applications (UEC Burke Hollow \nsite) is for an unmined site in Bee County.  The other \nnew application (Signal Equities Brown site) is for a \npreviously-mined site (USX Boots-Brown) in Live Oak \nCounty.  The application for expansion (STMV Palan-\ngana site) is in Duval County. \n \n \n\n6 \n \nIN THE COMMISSIONERS COURT  \nOF \nANDREWS COUNTY, TEXAS \nA resolution in support of establishing a site in  \nAndrews County for consolidated interim storage of \nspent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. \nWHEREAS, Andrews County, Texas, as host to two low-\nlevel radioactive waste disposal facilities operated \nby Waste Control Specialists LLC (\u201cWCS\u201d), greatly \nbenefits directly and indirectly from the economic \nactivity associated with disposal of radioactive ma-\nterials; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County recognizes the importance \nof a diversified economy to the livelihood of the citi-\nzens of Andrews County; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County is home to a specialized \nworkforce with expertise concerning radioactive ma-\nterials, and WCS currently employs more than 170 \nfull-time employees with an annual payroll of more \nthan $13 million in Andrews County; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County has invested in the suc-\ncess of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facil-\nities operated by WCS by issuing $75 million in \nbonds and using that revenue to purchase property \nleased by WCS as part of the operation of the dis-\nposal facilities; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County receives five percent of \nthe gross receipts from waste disposed of at the two \nlow-level radioactive waste disposal facilities, which \nreceipts to date have totaled over $5 million directly \npaid to Andrews County and are expected to total \nmore than $3 million per year in the future; and \n\n7 \n \nWHEREAS, WCS has consistently shown its commit-\nment to the environment and the citizens of Andrews \nCounty by, among other things, designing and oper-\nating safe, state-of-the-art radioactive materials fa-\ncilities, working to ensure that Andrews County \nshares in economic benefits because of WCS opera-\ntions, and working to ensure that local stakeholders \nare kept informed and made an integral part of the \ndecision-making process concerning WCS opera-\ntions; and \nWHEREAS, there are substantial quantities of Spent \nNuclear Fuel (\u201cSNF\u201d) and High- Level Radioactive \nWaste (\u201cHLW\u201d) currently stored at sites through-\nout Texas and the United States; and \nWHEREAS, much of the SNF and HLW is currently \nstored at sites that are vulnerable to natural disas-\nters and located near large metropolitan centers; \nand \nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy \n(the \u201cDOE\u201d) concluded in 2013 that a geologic repos-\nitory for the permanent disposal of SNF and HLW \nwill not be available until 2048, at the earliest; and \nWHEREAS, the federal Blue Ribbon Commission on \nAmerica\u2019s Nuclear Future in 2012 recommended \n\u201cprompt\u201d efforts to develop one or more consoli-\ndated SNF and HLW interim storage facilities while \nfurther efforts are made to develop a permanent dis-\nposal site; and \nWHEREAS, the Texas Commission on Environmental \nQuality (\u201cTCEQ\u201d) analyzed the challenges associ-\nated with creating a consolidated SNF and HLW in-\nterim storage solution in Texas in its March 2014 As-\n\n8 \n \nsessment of Texas\u2019s High Level Radioactive Waste \nStorage Options report (the \u201cReport\u201d); and \nWHEREAS, the TCEQ, in the Report, noted that con-\nsolidated SNF and HLW interim storage in Texas \nwould offer electricity consumers significant savings \ncompared to storage at each nuclear power plant and \nthat the siting and construction of a consolidated \nSNF and HLW interim storage facility is \u201cnot only \nfeasible but could be highly successful\u201d so long as \nthe approach \u201cminimizes local and state opposition \nthrough stakeholder meetings, finding volunteer \ncommunities, financial incentives, and a process that \nis considered fair and technically rigorous;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the Texas Radiation Advisory Board issued \nan official statement of its position \u201cthat it is in the \nstate\u2019s best interest to request that Texas be consid-\nered by the Federal Government as a consolidated \nSNF storage site;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the Governor of Texas noted that Texas \nshould \u201cbegin looking for a safe and secure solution \nfor HLW in Texas;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the workforce, the geography, and the ge-\nology of Andrews County make it an ideal location \nfor safe storage of radioactive materials, and An-\ndrews County is a volunteer community that wishes \nto offer its unique resources to help solve the state\u2019s \nand country\u2019s SNF and HLW storage problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AND OR-\nDERED that the Commissioners Court of Andrews \nCounty, Texas, meeting in open session, believes \nthat the construction and operation of a consolidated \nSNF and HLW interim storage facility in Andrews \n\n9 \n \nCounty (the \u201cFacility\u201d), licensed by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and developed by WCS, will \nenhance the health, safety, and welfare of the citi-\nzens of Andrews County; and \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED AND ORDERED that the \nCommissioners Court of Andrews County does \nhereby declare and express the commitment of An-\ndrews County to explore the development of the Fa-\ncility, and in support thereof does hereby call upon \nand ask: \nthe State of Texas, all its agencies, officials and \npolitical subdivisions, and all members of the \nTexas congressional delegation to work coopera-\ntively with all relevant entities towards the crea-\ntion of the Facility, including taking actions to ev-\nidence approval of the development of the Facil-\nity, such as executing and delivering letters of \nsupport, cooperative agreements, or other docu-\nments needed in connection with the site selec-\ntion, siting and licensing of the Facility; and \nthe State of Texas, all its agencies and officials, \nand all members of the Texas congressional dele-\ngation to assist Andrews County in securing all \nfederal incentives that may be available, as a re-\nsult of siting the Facility, from the DOE or an-\nother appropriate federal entity;

The license application fo-\ncuses primarily on receiving SNF from the existing per-\n\n13 \n \nmanently shutdown and/or decommissioned commercial \nreactors across the U.S.  WCS believes that this ap-\nproach will allow for the safe consolidated interim stor-\nage of SNF in a community that has expressed its will-\ningness to host such a facility consistent with the rec-\nommendations from President Barack Obama\u2019s Blue \nRibbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future, until \nsuch time that a permanent geologic repository is li-\ncensed, constructed, and able to serve the nation\u2019s need \nas envisioned under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982. \nThe purpose and objective of licensing the CISF in An-\ndrews County, Texas, is to allow the removal of SNF \nand the return of decommissioned reactor sites to a \ngreen field status.  These lands may be subsequently \nrepurposed in ways that economically benefit the com-\nmunities that had been willing to host commercial nu-\nclear reactors needed to generate electricity.  A con-\nservative and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis con-\ncluded that this is an economically efficient solution that \ncould reduce the expenditure of the Federal Govern-\nment by hundreds of millions of dollars compared to the \n\u201cno action\u201d alternative.  Additionally, by allowing the \nfederal government to meet its obligations to take spent \nnuclear fuel, this approach could also allow the burden \nto shift to the ratepayers, who have already paid into \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund, and save taxpayers over 5.4 \nbillion dollars.  Finally, there could be a benefit of over \n1 billion dollars to the local communities that are cur-\nrently hosting or that will in the future host de facto \u201cin-\nterim storage facilities\u201d at  \n \n \n\n14 \n \nCorporate \n5430 LBJ Freeway, Ste. \n1700 \nThree Lincoln Centre \nDallas, TX 75240 \nPh. 972.715.9800 \nFx. 972.448.1419 \nFacility \nP.O. Box 1129 \nAndrews, TX 79714 \nPh. 888.789-2783 \nFx. 432 525-8909 \nEnclosures transmitted herein contain SUNSI.  \nWhen separated from enclosures, this transmittal \ndocument is decontrolled. \ndecommissioning reactor sites, in that they would be \nable to more constructively repurpose land being used \nfor no other function than to store \u201cstranded\u201d fuel. \nAs specified in the license application, WCS anticipates \nthat the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) would take \ntitle to the SNF and transport it from existing storage \nsites across the U.S. to the CISF. \nWCS has prepared the license application consistent \nwith the requirements specified in Title 10 of the Code \nof Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 72, Licensing Re-\nquirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel, High-Level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor- \nRelated Greater Than Class C Waste. WCS also relied \non information provided in Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.50, \nStandard Format and Content for a Specific License \nApplication for an Independent Spent Fuel Storage In-\nstallation or Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility, \nto prepare the license. \nThe specific license application contains the following: \n\u2022  A Safety Analysis Report (SAR) which contains \nthe information specified in 10 CFR 72.24, Con-\ntents of application:  Technical information.  It \n\n15 \n \nwas prepared following the information provided \nin RG-3.48, Standard Format and Content for the \nSafety Analysis Report for an Independent Spent \nFuel Storage Installation or Monitored Retriev-\nable Storage Installation (Dry Storage).  Infor-\nmation provided in NUREG-1567, Standard Re-\nview Plan for Spent Fuel Dry Storage Facilities, \nwas also used to prepare the SAR. \n\u2022  A Quality Assurance Program Description is pro-\nvided in Chapter 6 and Appendix C to the license \napplication pursuant to 10 CFR 72.24(n) and \n72.140(d). \n\u2022  The Physical Security Plan, including the guard \ntraining, and a Safeguard Contingency Plan, are \nprovided pursuant to 10 CFR 72.24(o), 72.180, \nand 72.184, respectively, separately as part of \nthis license application because it contains Safe-\nguards Information. \n\u2022  Proposed Technical Specifications are provided \nin Appendix A of the license application pursuant \nto the requirements specified in 10 CFR 72.26. \n\u2022  A description of WCS\u2019 technical qualifications is \nprovided in Chapters 2 of the license application \npursuant to 10 CFR 72.28. \n\u2022  WCS\u2019 proposed training program is similarly de-\nscribed in Chapter 7 of the license application as \nrequired under 10 CFR 72.28(b) and \u00a7 72, Sub-\npart I. \n\u2022  A proposed decommissioning plan and decommis-\nsioning funding plan is provided in Chapter 10,  \nas well as Appendices B and D of license applica-\ntion.  A decommissioning cost estimate support-\n\n16 \n \ning the license application was prepared follow-\ning NUREG-1757, Consolidated Decommission-\ning Guidance. \n\u2022  WCS\u2019 Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is in-\ncluded as part of this application pursuant to 10 \nCFR 72.32.  This plan was prepared to include the \nlocation and hazards associated with storing SNF \nat the CISF following RG 3.67, Standard Format \nand Content for Emergency Plans for Fuel Cycle \nand Materials Facilities, and other guidance \nspecified in the ERP. \n\u2022  An Environmental Report was prepared to as-\nsess the radiological and non-radiological impacts \nassociated with storing up to 40,000 MTU of SNF \nfor a period of 40 years following NUREG-1748, \nEnvironmental Review Guidance for Licensing \nActions Associated with NMSS Programs.  WCS \nensured that the cumulative environmental im-\npacts associated with storing SNF at the CISF \nwere evaluated in a manner that avoids segmen-\ntation of the requirements specified in the Na\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Despite their differences, amici have a \nmutual interest in this case for two reasons. \n \nFirst, amici have a mutual interest in protecting \nthe businesses and property of their members from \nharm. This case concerns a license to store radioactive \nnuclear waste in the Permian Basin, where amici\u2019s \nmembers do business. The license will impede safe oil \nand gas development in one of the largest oilfields in \nthe world and threaten the only freshwater aquifers \nin the region. \nSecond, amici have a mutual interest in protect-\ning the right of their members to a day in court. \nAmici\u2019s members include family businesses that can-\nnot pay Washington lawyers or read the Federal \nRegister on a daily basis. Further, the time to inter-\nvene or comment in agency proceedings is often short, \nsee 83 Fed. Reg. 44,070 (Aug. 29, 2018) (60 days), and \nthe harm not always readily apparent from agency no-\ntices, see Gage v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d \n1214, 1218 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (\u201cThe ultimate impact, or \neven the likelihood of enforcement, of proposed rules \nmay be far from clear.\u201d). The Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission\u2019s argument against judicial review in \nthis case is therefore a recipe for regulatory capture \nand lawlessness. It would favor politically powerful \ninterests with the resources to participate in agency \n \n1 No party\u2019s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and \nno person or entity other than amici or its counsel made a mon-\netary contribution intended to fund its preparation or \nsubmission. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nproceedings and harm the public interest and the rule \nof law. \nAmici are: \nTHE PERMIAN BASIN PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION \n(\u201cPBPA\u201d). Formed in 1961 by a group of oilmen con-\ncerned about the federal government\u2019s growing \nregulatory role, PBPA has grown from fewer than \ntwenty members to over 1,000 member companies at \nits peak. PBPA represents the interests of exploration \nand production, service, midstream, and various other \nsupport services companies that operate in the Per-\nmian Basin. \nTHE NEW MEXICO FARM AND LIVESTOCK BUREAU. \nFormed in 1917 by New Mexico farmers and ranchers, \nthe New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau is the \nvoice of agriculture in New Mexico, advocating for \nfarm, ranch, and dairy families. \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFrom the beginning of the administrative state, \nfederal agencies have argued that there is no general \nlaw of judicial review. The right to review, they say, \nmust be conferred by the text of the review scheme at \nhand. This Court has rebuffed that argument time \nand again. This case should be no different. \n \nFirst, the Fifth Circuit correctly applied the \n\u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine. That doctrine is firmly rooted in \ntraditional principles of equity codified in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), which entitles \na person suffering \u201clegal wrong\u201d to judicial review, \neven if they are not \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved \nby agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. A long line of cases going back \nto the early days of the Interstate Commerce \nCommission (\u201cICC\u201d) applied the ultra vires doctrine in \nsuits brought by parties that did not participate in the \nunderlying agency proceedings but had a legally \nprotected interest at stake. When Congress later \nenacted special statutory review provisions to extend \njudicial review to a broader class of persons \nparticipating in the administrative process, those \nprovisions were not understood to displace equitable \nrights of review, but to supplement them. Here, the \nCommission\u2019s license deprives Texas of a right \nconferred by statute\u2014the State\u2019s right under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act to veto interim-storage \nfacilities. Texas Br. 31. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly applied the ultra vires doctrine. \nSecond, Texas and Fasken are both parties \naggrieved under Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. Relying \nupon a D.C. Circuit decision, the Commission reads \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d to mean a party to the agency \n\n \n4 \n \n \nproceeding. That is wrong. The Hobbs Act\u2019s text, \ncontext, and history demonstrates that the best \nreading of the term \u201cparty\u201d in Section 4 is an entity \nthat files a petition for review in court. Section 3 of the \nAct, for example, unambiguously uses \u201cparty\u201d to mean \npetitioner, and contextual clues and background \nprinciples point in the same direction. Congress did \nnot hide an exhaustion requirement in the words \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  \nRegardless, Fasken is a party because the term \n\u201cparty,\u201d as defined by the APA, is broad enough to \ninclude, at a minimum, an entity that sought to and \nis \u201centitled as of right\u201d to intervene, even though the \nCommission wrongfully denied intervention. See 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 551(3).  \nThird, even if \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d required \nexhaustion, the requirement is not jurisdictional. It \ncreates at most a condition to a right of review that \nequity excuses when, as here, an agency wrongfully \nrefuses intervenor status to an entity legally entitled \nto intervene. Fasken\u2019s multiple attempts to intervene \nshould make Fasken a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d in equity if \nnot in law. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTexas Has a Right to Challenge Ultra Vires \nAgency Action \nThe State of Texas explains that the Nuclear Reg-\nulatory Commission exceeded its authority by \ngranting a license to store nuclear waste away from a \nnuclear reactor in private facilities. The Fifth Circuit \nheld that Texas had a right to bring this \u201cultra vires\u201d \nchallenge even though Texas did not formally inter-\nvene in the licensing proceeding. See Texas v. NRC, 78 \nF.4th 827, 834\u201340 (5th Cir. 2023). \nThe Commission disparages this decision as rest-\ning upon a \u201cjudge-made\u201d exception that is contrary to \n\u201cplain text.\u201d U.S. Br. 20. Specifically, the Commission \nfocuses on one sentence in Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. \nThat sentence provides: \nAny party aggrieved by the final order may, \nwithin 60 days after its entry, file a petition to \nreview the order in the court of appeals \nwherein venue lies. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344. \nAccording to the Commission, the use of the word \n\u201cparty\u201d implies that only a person that intervened in \na licensing proceeding before the agency may seek re-\nview under the Hobbs Act\u2014at least when the agency \nholds a hearing on the record. Cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. Be-\ncause Texas did not formally intervene in the \nlicensing proceeding, the Commission argues, Texas \nwasn\u2019t a \u201cparty\u201d to the proceeding and cannot invoke \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act. U.S. Br. 16\u201320. \nNor can anybody else, and the Act\u2019s jurisdiction is \u201cex-\nclusive.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Commission further argues that \u201c[n]o one \nhas offered a principled defense of the [ultra vires] ex-\nception, which originated in dicta in a footnote in a \n1982 Fifth Circuit decision and lacks any grounding \nin this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d U.S. Br. 14; see also id. at \n20\u201326; see Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. ICC, 673 F.2d \n82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982). The upshot would be that \nthe license may \u201center a promised land free from legal \nchallenge.\u201d Herr v. U.S. Forest Serv., 803 F.3d 809, \n821 (6th Cir. 2015) (Sutton, J.). \nThe Commission is wrong. As explained below, \nthe ultra vires doctrine is deeply rooted in the law of \nequity and the text and history of the APA, which \nformed the backdrop of the Hobbs Act\u2019s review \nscheme. Under the APA, persons \u201csuffering legal \nwrong because of agency action\u201d are \u201centitled to judi-\ncial review thereof,\u201d even if they are not otherwise \n\u201cadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action \nwithin the meaning of a relevant statute\u201d\u2014here, the \nHobbs Act and the Atomic Energy Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. \nThis right codifies a long tradition of \u201cnonstatutory re-\nview\u201d allowing relief in equity for official acts in excess \nof legal authority. \nPersons suffering a legal wrong don\u2019t depend \nupon a right of review created by statute. Their rights \nflow from the law of equity now codified in the APA. \nAs this Court put it in a case involving an ICC order \nreviewed under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of 1913, \nthe immediate predecessor of the Hobbs Act: \nThe contention is that the commission has \nexceeded its statutory powers; and that, \nhence, the order is void. In such a case the \ncourts have jurisdiction of suits to enjoin the \nenforcement of an order, even if the plaintiff \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhas not attempted to secure redress in a \nproceeding before the commission. \nSkinner & Eddy Corp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557, \n562\u201363 (1919) (Brandeis, J.) (citing cases) (emphasis \nadded); see also Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trs. v. \nUnited States, 263 U.S. 143, 147\u201348 (1923) (\u201cThe mere \nfact that plaintiffs were not parties to the proceedings \nin which the order was entered does not constitute a \nbar to this suit. For it is brought to set aside an order \nalleged to be in excess of the Commission\u2019s power.\u201d). \nThere is no evidence that by using the words \u201cparty \naggrieved,\u201d the Hobbs Act meant to impliedly depart \nfrom this precedent and abrogate longstanding rights \nof review in equity codified in the APA\u2019s hard-fought \ntext. \nThe Fifth Circuit footnote the Commission calls \n\u201cdicta\u201d not grounded in precedent cited precedent, in-\ncluding Skinner. See Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 673 F.2d at \n85 n.4. The ultra vires doctrine is thus grounded in \nprecedent. The Commission brushes these precedents \noff as \u201cdecided before Congress brought judicial review \nof ICC orders within the Hobbs Act\u2019s ambit.\u201d U.S. Br. \n23. As discussed below, however, this Court recog-\nnized shortly after the Hobbs Act was enacted that the \nAPA\u2019s general right of review for a person suffering \nlegal wrong applies to cases brought under the Hobbs \nAct. The right of review for a party aggrieved recog-\nnized by the Hobbs Act is thus not exclusive, but \ncomplementary. \nA. The \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Doctrine Is Supported \nby Text, History, and Precedent \nIn a 1944 dissenting opinion, Justice Frankfurter \nargued that \u201c[t]here is no such thing as a common law \n\n \n8 \n \n \nof judicial review in the federal courts.\u201d Stark v. Wick-\nard, 321 U.S. 288, 312 (1944) (Frankfurter, J., \ndissenting). He claimed that the right to review an \nagency action must be found in \u201cthe text and texture \nof a particular law.\u201d Id. That is the view urged by the \nCommission. \nUnfortunately for the Commission, Justice \nFrankfurter\u2019s dissenting view was \u201cneither wholly \nsupported by the case law at that time nor has he been \nsustained by subsequent legislative or judicial devel-\nopments.\u201d Note, Remedies Against the United States \nand Its Officials, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 827, 912 (1957). It \nwas not the law then, and it is not the law now. To \nunderstand why, it is important to start from the very \nbeginning. \n1. Statutory Rights of Review Expanded \non Pre-existing Nonstatutory Rights \nBefore the APA, administrative lawyers classi-\nfied challenges to agency action into two broad forms \nof review. First, \u201cnonstatutory review.\u201d Off. of the \nAtt\u2019y Gen., Final Report of the Attorney General\u2019s \nCommittee on Administrative Procedure 80\u201381 (1941) \n(\u201c1941 AG Report\u201d); Walter Gellhorn & Clark Byse, \nAdministrative Law 218, 223\u201324 (1960). Second, \n\u201cstatutory review.\u201d 1941 AG Report 82\u201383; Gellhorn \n& Byse, supra, at 218\u201323; see also 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703 (\u201cThe \nform of proceeding for judicial review is the special \nstatutory review proceeding \u2026.). \nUnderstanding the Hobbs Act\u2019s right of review for \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requires understanding these two \nforms of review, and how they interact with each \nother. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n\u201cNonstatutory\u201d review. Suits against govern-\nment officials have never been wholly a matter of \ncongressional grace. Well before the APA, plaintiffs \nbrought suits for damages against agency officials, for \nejectment, or for some other remedy at common law or \nequity. 1941 AG Report 80\u201381; see, e.g., United States \nv. Lee, 106 U.S. 196 (1882); Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. \n170 (1804). In these cases, officers could always justify \ntheir conduct \u201cby referring to the law under which\u201d \nthe officer \u201cis acting.\u201d 1941 AG Report 81. This raised \n\u201cprecisely the issue whether the law does indeed au-\nthorize [the officer\u2019s] conduct under the circumstances\n\u2014the typical issue for judicial determination.\u201d Id. \n \nBy the 1940s, \u201cthe equity injunction ha[d] become \n\u2026 the common remedy,\u201d along with new actions for \ndeclaratory judgments. Id. These remedies in equity \noccupied \u201ca wide field in Federal administrative law.\u201d \nId. Persons could seek review in equity or declaratory \nrelief \u201cfor the review of major and long-established ac-\ntivities of Government for which no remedy was \nprovided by statute\u201d as well as \u201cwhere the remedy pro-\nvided by statute is not an adequate substitute or does \nnot include the particular situation involved.\u201d Id. at \n81\u201382 & nn.16\u201317 (citing cases); cf. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 703\u2013\n04. \nNot everyone adversely affected by agencies had \na right to sue in equity, however. Harm alone would \nnot sustain a bill in equity or a right to declaratory \nrelief. See Tenn. Elec. Power Co. v. TVA, 306 U.S. 118, \n137\u201338 (1939). \u201cIn equity as at law \u2026 courts recog-\nnized only limited rights of action.\u201d Caleb Nelson, \n\u201cStanding\u201d and Remedial Rights in Administrative \nLaw, 105 Va. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2019). Relief was gen-\nerally available only to prevent a threatened invasion \n\n \n10 \n \n \nof \u201ca legal right\u2014one of property, one arising out of \ncontract, one protected against tortious invasion, or \none founded on a statute which confers a privilege.\u201d \nTenn. Elec. Power Co., 306 U.S. at 137; see also 1941 \nAG Report 84. As one casebook put it, \u201c[t]he most im-\nportant basis of nonstatutory review is the proposition \nthat if an official invades a person\u2019s \u2018legal\u2019 rights\u2014or \nin other words, commits a \u2018legal wrong\u2019\u2014the ordinary \ncourts of the lands should be open to his plea for suit-\nable relief, just as they would be if controversy arose \nbetween two private persons.\u201d Gellhorn & Byse, su-\npra, at 224. \nThere were three categories of legal wrongs se-\ncured through non-statutory forms of review in equity. \nFirst, persons could seek an anti-suit injunction \nto restrain an officer\u2019s wrongful enforcement of an al-\nlegedly unlawful regulation or order. See, e.g., Shields \nv. Utah Idaho Cent. R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 183\u201384 \n(1938); Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, 223 U.S. 605, 621 \n(1912). This remedy, however, could be sought only by \n\u201cthe direct targets of regulation.\u201d Nelson, supra, at \n715. \nSecond, persons could seek equitable relief \u201cto \nprevent tortious invasions\u201d of their legal rights by gov-\nernment officials, such as a wrongful interference \nwith land, other property interests, contracts, or busi-\nness. Id. One example of this type of suit is American \nSchool of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94 \n(1902), where this Court allowed a business to chal-\nlenge the Postmaster General\u2019s unlawful decision to \nstop delivering mail to the business\u2014including \n\u201cchecks, drafts, money orders, and money itself\u201d\u2014\nbased upon the Postmaster\u2019s unilateral determination \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthat the business was fraudulent. Id. at 98\u201399, 108\u2013\n110. \nThird, a statute could create a \u201cprivilege\u201d for an \nindividual or a class, which could then be protected \nthrough a suit in equity. Nelson, supra, at 716. This \nCourt\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne, cited by the Fifth \nCircuit, falls into this category, as it concerned a stat-\nutory \u201cright\u201d enjoyed by a group of employees in \nderogation of the common law. 358 U.S. 184, 188\u201389 \n(1958). \nAlthough quite broad, nonstatutory forms of re-\nview left many economic harms unprotected by the \ncourts. For example, businesses would often seek to \nprevent illegal agency actions that permitted compe-\ntition against them. \u201cThe common law,\u201d however, \n\u201cdoes not recognize an interest in freedom from honest \ncompetition.\u201d Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. \nMcGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 153 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring). Harms arising from honest competition \nwere thus routinely dismissed by this Court as \u201cdam-\nnum absque injuria\u201d\u2014harm without a cognizable \ninjury. Tenn. Elec. Power Co., 306 U.S. at 137\u201338; see \nalso Ala. Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464, 478\u201379 \n(1938). \nStatutory Review. Congress sometimes enacts a \nspecific scheme of statutory review and did so many \ntimes before the APA. 1941 AG Report 82\u201383; \nGellhorn & Byse, supra, at 218\u201323. These schemes of-\nten channel jurisdiction over challenges to agency \naction to a specific court. By 1941, \u201c[r]eview in the Cir-\ncuit Courts of Appeals [was] the method provided by \nstatute for orders of a number of agencies.\u201d 1941 AG \nReport 83 (citing statutes).  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThese schemes often provided an expansive right \nof review for those \u201caggrieved.\u201d Section 402(b) of the \nCommunications Act of 1934 is one example. Pub. L. \nNo. 73-416, \u00a7 402(b), 48 Stat. 1064, 1093 (1934) (codi-\nfied as amended at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)). Section 402(b) \nprovided a direct appeal to the D.C. Circuit by either \nthe applicant for the permit or license, or \u201cany other \nperson aggrieved or whose interests are adversely af-\nfected by any decision of the Commission granting or \nrefusing any such application.\u201d Id. \nThis gave a right of review, or what courts then \nsometimes called \u201cprudential standing,\u201d to a broader \nclass of persons. Businesses that would be hurt by \ncompetition from the license applicant, for example, \ncould challenge a Federal Communications Commis-\nsion (\u201cFCC\u201d) license as inconsistent with the public \ninterest. FCC v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 \nU.S. 470, 473\u201374 (1940). Such provisions thus would \n\u201ccreate rights of action that the unwritten law would \nnot have recognized.\u201d Nelson, supra, at 725; FEC v. \nAkins, 524 U.S. 11, 19 (1998) (\u201cHistory associates the \nword \u2018aggrieved\u2019 with a congressional intent to cast \nthe standing net broadly\u2014beyond the common-law in-\nterests and substantive statutory rights upon which \n\u2018prudential\u2019 standing traditionally rested.\u201d). \n2. Conditions on New Statutory Rights of \nReview Did Not Limit Nonstatutory \nRights \nStatutory rights of action for aggrieved parties \nsometimes had limits. One limit required showing \nthat the aggrieved person invoking statutory rights \nparticipated in the underlying agency proceeding. \n1941 AG Report 85. For example, the Bituminous Coal \nConservation Act of 1937 allowed \u201c[a]ny person \n\n \n13 \n \n \naggrieved by an order issued by the [agency] in a pro-\nceeding to which such person is a party\u201d to bring an \naction in circuit court. Pub. L. No. 75-48, \u00a7 6(b), 50 \nStat. 72, 85 (emphasis added). \nIn these cases, participating in the agency pro-\nceeding could confer a right to sue on a person who \notherwise could not have sought equitable relief. In \nthe foundational Chicago Junction Case, this Court \nheld that \u201cplaintiffs may challenge [an] order\u201d of the \nICC, even if they have no otherwise protected legal in-\nterest in equity, \u201cbecause they are parties to it.\u201d 264 \nU.S. 258, 267 (1924). Participating could thus confer \nnovel rights to review. \nThese participation requirements, however, did \nnot displace the pre-existing rights of persons suffer-\ning a legal wrong already protected by equity. 1941 \nAG Report 85. Courts applied these participation re-\nquirements only to limit suits brought by persons \u201cnot \nentitled, without the statutory provision, to initiate \nlitigation in a court.\u201d Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, \n325 U.S. 385, 391 (1945). As this Court noted, \u201c[i]n \nawarding a review of an administrative proceeding \nCongress has power to formulate the conditions under \nwhich resort to the courts may be had.\u201d Id. at 389. \nCourts, however, did not understand rights protected \nby equity as a matter of a congressional award or \ngrace, but as part of the general law of judicial review. \nCf. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534 (1993) \n(\u201cStatutes \u2026 are to be read with a presumption favor-\ning the retention of long-established and familiar \nprinciples[.]\u201d). \nThe issue came up very early in the history of spe-\ncial statutory review schemes. In the Mann-Elkins \nAct of 1910, Congress created a Commerce Court with \n\n \n14 \n \n \n\u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction over, among other things, \nsuits \u201cbrought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend \nin whole or in part any order of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission.\u201d Pub. L. No. 61-218, 36 Stat. 539, \n539\u201340. Section 5 governed who could appear as party \nto the suit. Apart from the ICC, \u201cany party or parties \nin interest to the proceeding before the commission, in \nwhich an order or requirement is made, [could] appear \nas parties thereto.\u201d Id. \u00a7 5, 36 Stat. at 543. Shortly af-\nter, agents of a trade group brought suit to challenge \nan order of the Commission that would interfere with \nthe business of its members. F.H. Peavey & Co. v. Un-\nion Pac. R. Co., 176 F. 409, 416 (C.C.W.D. Mo. 1910). \nProponents objected to the suit on the basis that the \nagents \u201cwere not parties to the proceeding before the \ncommission upon which the order challenged is \nbased.\u201d Id. \nThe lower court rejected this argument as not \n\u201cthe true rule of right or of practice.\u201d Id. at 417. The \ncourt refused to read Section 5 of the Mann-Elkins Act \nto abrogate \u201cgeneral rules and practice in equity,\u201d al-\nlowing \u201cany party whose rights of property are in \ndanger of irreparable injury from an unauthorized or-\nder of the commission [to] appeal to a federal court of \nequity for relief.\u201d Id. \nThis Court affirmed. ICC v. Diffenbaugh, 222 \nU.S. 42 (1911) (Holmes, J.). On the question of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 right to review, or what the Court loosely \nlabeled \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d the Court was \u201ccontent to leave \nthat matter on the statement of the court below. The \nplaintiffs are affected by the order, and it is just that \nthey should have a chance to be heard, although not \nparties before the Commission.\u201d Id. at 49 (citation \nomitted). \n\n \n15 \n \n \nDiffenbaugh soon came to be understood as allow-\ning challenges to ultra vires ICC orders interfering \nwith legal rights. Thus, in suits brought under the Ur-\ngent Deficiencies Act, the predecessor of the Hobbs \nAct, the Court recognized the ultra vires doctrine. \nWhen a plaintiff alleging a legal wrong didn\u2019t simply \nargue that an ICC order was unreasonable, but ar-\ngued that the ICC \u201cha[d] exceeded its statutory \npowers; and that, hence, the order is void,\u201d then \n\u201ccourts ha[d] jurisdiction of suits to enjoin the enforce-\nment of an order, even if the plaintiff has not \nattempted to secure redress in a proceeding before the \ncommission.\u201d Skinner, 249 U.S. at 562; see also Ed-\nward Hines, 263 U.S. at 147\u201348 (same). Nonstatutory \nrights of review thus were not altered by exhaustion \nrequirements conditioning rights of review conferred \nthrough statute. \nIn the Chicago Junction Case, this Court summa-\nrized the regime applicable to review of ICC orders as \nfollows: \nNo case has been found in which either this \ncourt, or any lower court, has denied to one \nwho was a party to the proceedings before the \nCommission the right to challenge the order \nentered therein. On the other hand, persons \nwho were entitled to become parties before the \nCommission, but did not do so, have been \nallowed to maintain such suits where the \nrequisite interest was shown. \n264 U.S. at 268. \nOther agency orders later made subject to the \nHobbs Act largely followed the procedures and equita-\nble tradition applicable to judicial review of ICC \n\n \n16 \n \n \norders.2 Most came without any statutory rights of re-\nview. Section 402(a) of the Communications Act, for \nexample, generally made FCC orders reviewable un-\nder the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Would-be plaintiffs \nsuing under Section 402(a) would obtain review by \nshowing an interference with protected legal inter-\nests, such as contract rights with broadcasting \nstations. See CBS v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 408, \n415\u201317 (1942). \n3. The APA Codified Nonstatutory Rights \nof Review \nThe 1946 APA was designed to work with statu-\ntory review schemes such as those created in the \nCommunications Act, and \u201cclarify, if not expand, the \nscope of judicial review.\u201d See Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. \n558, 610 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judg-\nment); see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703. \n \nSection 10(a) answers who is \u201centitled to judicial \nreview,\u201d the relevant question here. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. \nThe APA divides the groups into two classes, those \n\u201csuffering a legal wrong,\u201d and those \u201cadversely af-\nfected or aggrieved by agency action within the \nmeaning of a relevant statute.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). \nAs Caleb Nelson and many scholars of administrative \nlaw have noted, the \u201clegal wrong\u201d clause was enacted \nto codify the pre-existing law of nonstatutory review, \nwhile the second clause was meant to recognize that \n \n2 See Shipping Act of 1916, Pub. L. No. 64-260, \u00a7 31, 39 Stat. 728, \n738; Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, Pub. L. No. 67-51, \n\u00a7 204(a), (e), 42 Stat. 159, 162; see also id. \u00a7 204(h) (\u201cThe circuit \ncourt of appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review, and \nto affirm, set aside, or modify, such orders \u2026.\u201d); Perishable Agri-\ncultural Commodities Act of 1930, Pub. L. No. 71-325, \u00a7\u00a7 10\u201311, \n46 Stat. 531, 535. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nstatutory schemes could sometimes create more ex-\npansive rights to review, as with Section 402(b) of the \nCommunications Act. Nelson, supra, at 727, 729\u201330. \n4. The Hobbs Act Didn\u2019t Impliedly Repeal \nthe APA\u2019s General Right to Review \nThe Hobbs Act was enacted in 1950. Pub. L. No. \n81-901, 64 Stat. 1129. It was written largely to replace \nthe three-judge procedure followed under the Urgent \nDeficiencies Act with direct review in circuit courts, \nsimilar to the procedure followed for review of Federal \nTrade Commission orders and many other agencies. \nH.R. Rep. No. 81-2122 (1950), as reprinted in 1950 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 4303, 4305\u201306. Section 2 made jurisdic-\ntion over challenges to specific orders exclusive to \ncircuits courts, Section 3 provided venue, and Section \n4, at issue here, governed how to petition for review of \nan order.  \nThere is no evidence that the Judicial Conference \nor Congress meant to abrogate precedents such as \nSkinner by limiting suit to only participants in agency \nproceedings, even when the agency acted in excess of \nauthority. Indeed, as explained in greater detail be-\nlow, the framers of the Hobbs Act most likely used the \nword \u201cparty\u201d as shorthand for the person petitioning \nfor review in court, not a party in interest to the \nagency proceedings. See infra Part II.A. But in any \nevent, the term \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d is best read in con-\ntext to \u201cexpand\u201d rights of review beyond persons with \nrecognized legal injuries, not to \u201cconstrict\u201d pre-exist-\ning rights of review in equity. Cf. Antonin Scalia, The \nDoctrine of Legal Standing as an Essential Element in \nthe Separation of Powers, 17 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 881, \n889 (1983). \n\n \n18 \n \n \nThat is how this Court first read the Hobbs Act. \nIn United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. \n192 (1956), Storer filed a comment objecting to a pro-\nposed FCC order that would limit the number of radio \nbroadcast stations one company could own. Id. at 193\u2013\n94. Storer filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit \nunder the Hobbs Act, invoking 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. Id. at \n194\u201395 & nn.2, 4. \nOn certiorari, this Court addressed sua sponte \n\u201c[i]f respondent could \u2026 rightfully seek review from \nthe order adopting the challenged regulations.\u201d Id. at \n197. In answer, the Court observed that \u201c[u]nder the \nabove-cited Code sections, review of Commission ac-\ntion is granted any party aggrieved or suffering legal \nwrong by that action.\u201d Id. at 197 (emphasis added). A \nfootnote clarified that the APA added \u201csuffering legal \nwrong\u201d as an alternative basis to invoke review under \nthe Hobbs Act. Id. at 197 n.6. Thus, in Storer Broad-\ncasting, this Court recognized that the Hobbs Act did \nnot impliedly repeal or limit the APA\u2019s general right \nof review for persons suffering a legal wrong because \nof agency action.3 The Court went on to hold that \nStorer was sufficiently injured because the order \u201cop-\nerate[d] to control [Storer\u2019s] business affairs.\u201d Id. at \n199. \nThe Court\u2019s nearly contemporaneous under-\nstanding of the Hobbs Act as supplementing the APA\u2019s \ngeneral right of review should be entitled to consider-\nable weight, far more than the decisions of lower \ncourts decades later. \n \n3 Respondents here also invoked 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, including in \ntheir petition for review. See No. 21-60743 (5th Cir.), ECF No. \n34-2 at 2; ECF No. 62 at 6 n.2. \n\n \n19 \n \n \nTo be sure, under the Hobbs Act, the \u201cform of pro-\nceeding\u201d is a direct petition in circuit court. 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 703; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(4). Subject-matter jurisdiction \nrests upon circuit courts, and that exclusive jurisdic-\ntion may not be evaded through a suit for equitable \nrelief in district court invoking federal-question juris-\ndiction, even when challenging ultra vires agency \naction. See FCC v. ITT World Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. \n463, 469 (1984). The APA\u2019s right of review doesn\u2019t con-\nfer any subject-matter jurisdiction on the court and so \ncannot be used to create subject-matter jurisdiction in \ndistrict courts where none exists. Id. \nBut that is not what Texas asks for here. Texas \nfiled in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich has subject-matter jurisdiction over the order \nunder Section 2 of the Hobbs Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(4). \nOnce a person has filed in circuit court, however, the \nright of review, or cause of action, is not limited to par-\nties in interest to the agency proceeding. As Storer \nBroadcasting indicates, petitioners who suffer a legal \nwrong because of agency action may seek review in a \ncircuit court vested with jurisdiction under Section 2. \nThat is the doctrine of Skinner. ITT World is therefore \ninapposite. \nB. The Fifth Circuit Properly Applied the \n\u201cUltra Vires\u201d Doctrine \nWith that understanding, the only question is \nwhether the Fifth Circuit properly applied the ultra \nvires doctrine. It did. \nThe Fifth Circuit noted that Texas challenges the \nlicense as exceeding the Commission\u2019s power. Texas v. \nNRC, 78 F.4th at 839. Further, the injury alleged by \nTexas qualifies as a legal wrong. The Nuclear Waste \n\n \n20 \n \n \nPolicy Act confers upon Texas a legal right to veto in-\nterim-storage facilities. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10136(b), \n10155(d), 10156(e), 10166, 10169; Texas Br. 31. As in \nLeedom, cited by the Fifth Circuit, this vested Texas \nwith a legal right the license infringes upon. 358 U.S. \nat 189. This qualifies as a legal wrong. Cf. Hardin v. \nKy. Utils. Co., 390 U.S. 1 (1968); Safir v. Gibson, 417 \nF.2d 972, 978 (2d Cir. 1969) (Friendly, J.); Nelson, su-\npra, at 716\u201317. \nBecause the ultra vires doctrine is supported by \ntext, history, and precedent, and because the Fifth \nCircuit correctly applied it, this Court should reach \nthe merits and affirm. \nII. Texas and Fasken Are Parties Aggrieved \nTexas and Fasken are also both parties aggrieved \nunder the Hobbs Act. As an initial matter, the term \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d likely simply referred to the party \npetitioning in court. But even if that is wrong, Fasken \nwas a party to the proceeding within the meaning of \nthe Hobbs Act. \nA. \u201cParty\u201d Means Petitioner \nThe Commission argues that the use of the word \n\u201cparty\u201d to modify \u201caggrieved,\u201d as opposed to person, \nmust have implicitly referred to parties in interest to \nagency proceedings. U.S. Br. 18. The Commission \neven claims that meaning is \u201cunambiguous.\u201d U.S. Br. \n26. Years after the Hobbs Act was enacted, the D.C. \nCircuit would assume the same, contrasting the use of \nthe word \u201cparty\u201d to the use of the word \u201cperson\u201d in \nSection 10(a) of the APA. Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d \n40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983). With all due respect, Simmons \nis likely wrong. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nCongress did not use the word \u201cparty\u201d to limit re-\nview across the board only to parties who participated \nin the underlying agency proceeding. To the contrary, \nthe word \u201cparty\u201d in Section 4 simply meant \u201cpeti-\ntioner.\u201d \nThe original venue provision of the Hobbs Act, \nSection 3, used \u201cparty\u201d to refer to a person filing a pe-\ntition for review: \nThe venue of any proceeding under this Act \nshall be in the judicial circuit wherein is the \nresidence of the party or any of the parties \nfiling the petition for review, or wherein such \nparty or any of such parties has its principal \noffice, or in the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit. \n64 Stat. at 1130. Under Section 3, the \u201cparty,\u201d there-\nfore, was the person \u201cfiling the petition for review,\u201d \nnot a party to the agency proceedings. \nCongress confirmed that \u201cparty\u201d means peti-\ntioner when, in 1966, it replaced the cumbersome \nphrase \u201cparty or any of the parties filing the petition \nfor review\u201d in Section 3 with the single word \u201cpeti-\ntioner,\u201d Pub. L. No. 89-554, \u00a7 4(e), 80 Stat. 378, 622 \n(1966), and explained that it made this change \u201cfor \nclarity and conciseness,\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 89-901, at 196 \n(1965); S. Rep. No. 89-1380, at 215 (1966). Congress \nfurther defined the term petitioner to mean \u201cthe party \nor parties by whom a petition to review an order, re-\nviewable under this chapter, is filed,\u201d again \nconfirming that Congress used the simple word \n\u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in the Hobbs Act to mean the in-\njured petitioner seeking review in a court of law. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2341. \n\n \n22 \n \n \nContext supports this reading. Section 8, govern-\ning intervention, uses different terminology to refer to \nparties participating before the agency. As under the \npreceding Mann-Elkins Act provision at issue in the \nChicago Junction Case, Section 8 provides that \u201c[t]he \nagency, and any party or parties in interest in the pro-\nceeding before the agency whose interests will be \naffected \u2026 may appear as parties thereto of their own \nmotion and as of right.\u201d 64 Stat. at 1131. Thus, when \nCongress wanted to refer to parties to the agency pro-\nceeding it used the unambiguous phrase \u201cparty or \nparties in interest to the proceeding before the \nagency.\u201d This shows that \u201cCongress knows how to\u201d say \nwhat it \u201cwants to.\u201d Omni Cap. Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf \nWolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 106 (1987). Far from rein-\nforcing Simmons, U.S. Br. 19, Section 8 cuts against \nit. \nAnother provision, Section 7, authorizes judicial \nreview even when the agency \u201chas held no hearing\u201d \nand proceeded informally, not on the record. 64 Stat. \nat 1130. Not all orders subject to the Hobbs Act must \nbe made after a formal hearing. Congress knew that. \nHenry P. Chandler, then-Director of the Administra-\ntive Office of the U.S. Courts and one of the Hobbs \nAct\u2019s principal designers, explained to Congress that \nthe Act must apply to orders that are \u201clegislative or \nadministrative in nature which are made upon infor-\nmal hearings in no sense adversary in character.\u201d \nProviding for the Review of Orders of Certain Agencies, \nand Incorporating into the Judicial Code Certain Stat-\nutes Relating to Three-Judge District Courts: Hearing \non H.R. 1468, H.R. 1470, and H.R. 2271 Before Sub-\ncomm. No. 3 and Subcomm. No. 4 of the H. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 80th Cong., at 81 (1947) (letter from Mr. \nChandler). If only formal parties to an agency \n\n \n23 \n \n \nproceeding could seek review, then this provision \nwould be a nullity. Reading \u201cparty\u201d to mean petitioner \nthus makes more sense than reading \u201cparty\u201d to mean \ncommenter in some cases and intervenor in others, as \nthe Commission would have it. \u201c[S]tatutes are not \nchameleons, acquiring different meanings when pre-\nsented in different contexts.\u201d Env\u2019t Comm. of Fla. \nElec. Power Coordinating Grp., Inc. v. EPA, 94 F.4th \n77, 115 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \nBackground principles support this reading. Im-\nplying an exhaustion requirement from the use of the \nambiguous word \u201cparty\u201d is inconsistent with the APA. \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. The APA, \u201cby its very terms, has lim-\nited the availability of the doctrine of exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies to that which the statute or \nrule clearly mandates.\u201d Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. \n137, 146 (1993). The words \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d do not \nclearly mandate exhaustion of remedies, so the term \n\u201cparty\u201d in Section 4 is best read to mean simply a pe-\ntitioner aggrieved by the order, not a party before the \nagency. \nFurther, when Congress wanted to impose ex-\nhaustion of remedies, it did so with far greater clarity. \nIn a 1952 amendment to the Communications Act, for \nexample, Congress required filing a petition for recon-\nsideration before petitioning for judicial review \n\u201cwhere the party seeking such review \u2026 was not a \nparty to the proceedings resulting in such decision, or-\nder, or requirement.\u201d Pub. L. No. 82-554, \u00a7 15, 66 Stat. \n711, 720 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405). Here, Congress \nused \u201cparty\u201d to mean the petitioner in court and used \nthe unambiguous phrase \u201cparty to the [agency] pro-\nceedings\u201d to require exhaustion. This requirement \n\n \n24 \n \n \nwould be surplusage if \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d meant what \nthe Commission says. \nFinally, supposing Congress did use the word \n\u201cparty\u201d as a camouflaged exhaustion requirement, it, \nlike many other exhaustion requirements, would be \nsubject to equitable doctrines. See, e.g., Parts III, IV; \nSantos-Zacaria v. Garland, 598 U.S. 411, 416\u201317 \n(2023).  \nThe word \u201cparty\u201d in Section 4 meant \u201cpetitioner.\u201d \nA necessary premise of the Commission\u2019s argument \ntherefore fails, and this Court must reach the merits. \nTexas and Fasken were petitioners, and they are no \ndoubt aggrieved, so they are parties aggrieved. \nB. A Would-Be Intervenor Is a \u201cParty\u201d to \nthe Proceeding \nIn any event, even if \u201cparty\u201d does mean a party to \nthe agency proceedings, the term \u201cparty\u201d is broad \nenough to embrace Fasken, given that Fasken sought \nto and had a clear right to intervene in the licensing \nproceeding. \nThe term \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding is de-\nfined by the APA as follows: \n\u201c[P]arty\u201d includes a person or agency named or \nadmitted as a party, or properly seeking and \nentitled as of right to be admitted as a party, \nin an agency proceeding, and a person or \nagency admitted by an agency as a party for \nlimited purposes. \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(3). Notably, the term \u201cparty\u201d is not lim-\nited to those \u201cadmitted,\u201d but includes anyone \n\u201cproperly seeking and entitled as of right to be admit-\nted as a party.\u201d \n\n \n25 \n \n \nFasken sought to intervene in a timely manner \nand had a right to intervene. The Atomic Energy Act \nprovides that \u201cthe Commission shall grant a hearing \nupon the request of any person whose interest may be \naffected by the proceeding, and shall admit any such \nperson as a party to such proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A). Because Fasken\u2019s ownership of land \nnear the proposed storage site entitled it to be admit-\nted, the Court should treat Fasken as a \u201cparty\u201d and \nreach the merits. \nIII. The \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d Right of Review Is \nNot Jurisdictional \nInterim Storage Partners argues that \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d status is a \u201cjurisdictional provision.\u201d ISP Br. \n10. The D.C. Circuit has also treated Section 4 of the \nHobbs Act, including party-aggrieved status, as juris-\ndictional. See Ohio Nuclear-free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); Matson Navigation \nCo. v. DOT, 77 F.4th 1151, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 2023).4 \nThat\u2019s wrong. \u201cParty aggrieved\u201d status is not a \nprerequisite affecting a court\u2019s power to entertain a \npetition for review. If the Court disagrees with the \nreasoning of the Fifth Circuit, then it shouldn\u2019t order \nthe court to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, but re-\nmand for further proceedings while acknowledging \nthe possibility of equitable exceptions. See Part IV. \nSection 4 of the Hobbs Act, and specifically, the \nright \nof \nreview \nfor \nparties \n\u201caggrieved,\u201d \nisn\u2019t \n \n4 This Court has assumed, without analysis, that the 60-day fil-\ning window in Section 4 of the Hobbs Act is jurisdictional. ICC v. \nBhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270, 287 (1987). \n \n\n \n26 \n \n \njurisdictional. See Texas Br. 15. Rather, it provides a \nright of review for petitioners, or what this Court has \noften called \u201cprudential standing.\u201d See Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n127\u201328 (2014). For that reason, Section 4 is not one of \nthose rare procedural rules that is truly \u201c\u2018jurisdic-\ntional,\u2019 and therefore precludes equitable exceptions.\u201d \nHarrow v. DOD, 601 U.S. 480, 482 (2024). It goes to \nthe right of review, not the subject-matter jurisdiction \nor power of the Court. \nAs this Court reiterated last term, \u201cth[e] Court \nwill treat a procedural requirement as jurisdictional \nonly if Congress clearly states that it is.\u201d Id. at 484 \n(quotation marks omitted). Although \u201cCongress of \ncourse need not use \u2018magic words,\u2019\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cde-\nmand for a clear statement erects a \u2018high bar.\u2019\u201d Id. \nThat bar is met only when the \u201ctraditional tools of \nstatutory construction \u2026 plainly show that Congress \nimbued [the provision] with jurisdictional conse-\nquences.\u201d \nId. \nCongress\u2019s \ninstruction \nmust \nbe \n\u201cunmistakabl[e].\u201d Santos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 417. If \n\u201cmultiple plausible interpretations exist\u2014only one of \nwhich is jurisdictional\u2014it is difficult to make the case \nthat the jurisdictional reading is clear.\u201d Id. at 416. \nThe \u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction\u201d \ndo not \u201cplainly show that Congress imbued\u201d Sec-\ntion 4\u2019s party-aggrieved status \u201cwith jurisdictional \nconsequences.\u201d Harrow, 601 U.S. at 484. To begin, \nSection 4 doesn\u2019t mention \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2344. Section 2 does provide that \u201c[j]urisdiction is \ninvoked by filing a petition as provided by\u201d Section 4. \nId. \u00a7 2342. But Section 4 governs only the manner or \nform used to invoke jurisdiction\u2014the petition for re-\nview\u2014and sets forth claims-processing and service \n\n \n27 \n \n \nrules that are very unlikely to be jurisdictional. Id. \n\u00a7 2344. The passing reference to a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d is \nnot phrased as a requirement, nor is it phrased as a \nrestriction on parties or claims, or a limitation on \ncourts\u2019 power. It is an invitation to file suit with a \nshort expiration date\u2014i.e., a party aggrieved by an \nagency order \u201cmay\u201d challenge it by filing a petition \n\u201cwithin 60 days after\u201d the order\u2019s entry. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2344. \nIf Congress wanted this provision to have juris-\ndictional consequences, then it would have been more \nexplicit. For example, Congress could have stated ex-\npressly that courts would only have jurisdiction over \npetitions filed by parties aggrieved or that courts \nwould not have jurisdiction over petitions that others \nfiled. Congress could also have specified in Section 2 \nthat \u201conly a party aggrieved\u201d may invoke the federal \ncourts\u2019 \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d rather than just stating that a \npetition is enough and leaving details about the peti-\ntion to another provision. The bare mention of \n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d at the end of a separate section that ref-\nerences Section 4 is not enough to make that section \njurisdictional. \nA brief look at other statutes that this Court has \nrecently held to be nonjurisdictional suggests that the \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d provision is nonjurisdictional, too. \nFor example, in Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U.S. \n541 (2019), this Court confronted Title VII\u2019s charge-\nfiling instructions, which share a key structural simi-\nlarity with Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. Namely, they \nare contained in \u201c[s]eparate provisions\u201d from Title \nVII\u2019s jurisdictional provisions, id. at 550\u201351. These \n\u201cprovisions do not speak to a court\u2019s authority or refer \nin any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts. \n\n \n28 \n \n \nInstead, Title VII\u2019s charge-filing provisions speak to a \nparty\u2019s procedural obligations.\u201d Id. at 551 (cleaned \nup). The same is true of Section 4 of the Hobbs Act. \nSection 2 is a jurisdictional provision, entitled \u201cJuris-\ndiction of court of appeals,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, while \nSection 4 contains the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d language but \nentirely omits any reference to the court\u2019s \u201cjurisdic-\ntion\u201d and instead lays out charge-filing instructions \nand claim-processing rules, including deadlines, par-\nties, and the contents of any petition for review. Id. \n\u00a7 2344. \nThis Court has confronted analogous provisions \nand held that they are nonjurisdictional. See, e.g., \nSantos-Zacaria, 598 U.S. at 418 (explaining an immi-\ngration law provision \u201cdiffers substantially from more \nclearly jurisdictional language in related statutory \nprovisions\u201d). The right of review in Section 4 is nonju-\nrisdictional for the same reasons. This means a court \nmay \u201cexcuse the party\u2019s non-compliance for equitable \nreasons.\u201d Harrow, 601 U.S. at 483\u201384. \nIV. The Court May Award Party Status Nunc \nPro Tunc \nFasken is already a party to the agency proceed-\ning as a matter of law. See Part II. But regardless, the \nequitable doctrine of \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d\u2014i.e., now for \nthen\u2014would provide Fasken with an equitable rem-\nedy. \u201cIt is familiar doctrine that courts always have \njurisdiction over their records to make them conform \nto what was actually done at the time.\u201d Aetna Ins. Co. \nv. Boon, 95 U.S. 117, 125 (1877). This Court, or the \nFifth Circuit on remand, has equitable discretion to \ncorrect the administrative record of the Commission, \ncurrently before the court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2346, and deem \nFasken\u2019s \nintervention \n\u201cas \ntaking \neffect \non \n\n \n29 \n \n \napproximately the date it would have\u201d but for the \nCommission\u2019s wrongful denial, making Fasken\u2019s peti-\ntion for review timely, see Ethyl Corp. v. Browner, 67 \nF.3d 941, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (backdating an EPA li-\ncense allowing the sale of a fuel additive to redress a \nwrongful denial). \nFailure to provide equitable relief to Fasken \nwould be wrong. The Commission\u2019s treatment of \nFasken\u2019s request to intervene was manifestly illegal, \nand it would be inequitable to allow the Commission \nto evade judicial review because it wrongfully denied \nintervention. Fasken is in a similar bind as the parties \nin Diffenbaugh. As the circuit court there explained: \nThese parties have no remedy at law. Are they \ndeprived of the right to equitable relief be-\ncause those opposed to them did not cause \nthem to be made parties to the proceeding \u2026? \nIf so, parties may easily deprive those injuri-\nously affected by such orders of all relief by \nmaking, as in this case, those having a like in-\nterest parties to the proceeding and excluding \nthose who are interested in opposition to their \ninterest. In such a case none of the parties to \nthe proceeding may successfully maintain a \nsuit to challenge the order, because none of \ntheir interests are irreparably or at all in-\njured, and, if those whose interests are \ninjuriously affected may not assail it, the or-\nder is impregnable. \nF.H. Peavey & Co., 176 F. at 417. \nFasken\u2019s multiple attempts to intervene in the \nCommission\u2019s licensing proceeding justify an equita-\nble remedy. No one disputes that Fasken would have \n\n \n30 \n \n \nbeen a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d had its motions to intervene \nsucceeded, U.S. Br. 29\u201330, and the Commission re-\njected these motions on extralegal grounds. So, \nFasken is not to blame for failing to meet the Commis-\nsion\u2019s strict reading of Section 4\u2019s \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nlanguage. \nFasken did all it reasonably could to intervene \nbut was thwarted at every turn. Even before it \u201csub-\nmitted \nvarious \ncomments,\u201d \nand \n\u201c[b]efore \nthe \nproceeding was terminated, Fasken timely filed five \ncontentions\u201d to intervene. Texas v. NRC, 78 F.4th at \n834. The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (the \nCommission\u2019s adjudicatory division) \u201cdenied each one\u201d \nand then denied Fasken\u2019s motions to reopen the rec-\nord to amend one of its previously filed contentions. \nId. Finally, \u201c[b]ased on the draft environmental im-\npact statement, Fasken also filed a second motion to \nreopen the adjudicatory proceeding. The Board once \nagain denied the request.\u201d Id.; see also In re Interim \nStorage Partners LLC, 2021 WL 8087739, at *5\u20136 \n(N.R.C. Jan. 29, 2021). Fasken was nothing if not dil-\nigent in its attempt to participate. \nMoreover, the Commission erred badly in deny-\ning Fasken\u2019s requests for intervention. The Atomic \nEnergy Act directs the Commission to permit inter-\nvention by entities like Fasken. The Commission \n\u201cshall admit any [interested] person as a party\u201d to an \nNRC licensing proceeding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A) \n(emphasis added). There is no question that Fasken is \nan \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of the stat-\nute and so should have been allowed to intervene. In \nfact, the Commission acknowledged that Fasken owns \nland in the Permian Basin just miles from the pro-\nposed storage site that faces radiation leak risks. In re \n\n \n31 \n \n \nInterim Storage Partners LLC, 90 N.R.C. 31, 51\u201352 \n(Aug. 23, 2019). \nIt is a \u201cfoundational principle\u201d that it is \u201cinequi-\ntable that a wrongdoer should make a profit out of his \nown wrong.\u201d Cf. Liu v. SEC, 591 U.S. 71, 79\u201380 (2020) \n(cleaned up). The Commission\u2019s inequitable refusal to \nallow Fasken\u2019s intervention shouldn\u2019t be rewarded \nwith a win. \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 22, 2025 \n \nJames R.

Rev. 159 \n (1991) ................................................................. 4, 22 \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTERESTS OF AMICI CURIAE \nNew Mexico and Michigan have a strong interest \nin protecting principles of federalism and ensuring \nthat states have recourse to challenge federal agency \ndecisions. This is particularly true when such \ndecisions affect the safety and wellbeing of the people \nwithin their borders. \nAlthough the nuclear industry helps protect and \npower our nation, determining where to store the \nwaste it generates is a difficult question; the improper \nstorage of intensely radioactive nuclear waste would \nbe catastrophic. As such, Amici States have an \nespecially strong interest in deciding whether to allow \nconsolidation of the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel within \ntheir borders.  \nPetitioners advance an unduly limited reading of \n\u201caggrieved party\u201d under the Hobbs Act, contrary to \nCongress\u2019s consent-based siting policy. That policy, \nprovided for by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, ensures, \nin relevant part, that a state have a voice in \ndetermining whether it will host a nuclear waste \nrepository. Petitioners\u2019 cramped reading also fails to \nensure critical state interests are properly considered, \nresults in inconsistent application of the term \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d across agencies, denies review to impacted \nparties who participated in underlying agency \nproceedings, and is ultimately contrary to the clear \nintent of Congress that final agency determinations \nbe subject to judicial review. \nAmici States thus have a strong interest in \nensuring that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s \nactions are subject to judicial review. Amici support \n\n2 \n \n \nRespondents in their efforts to ensure that all \naggrieved parties may challenge agency action.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nDespite the need for a permanent facility to store \nspent nuclear fuel (SNF), such a facility has not yet \nbeen \nbuilt. \nTwo \ncompanies\u2014Interim \nStorage \nPartners, LLC (ISP) and Holtec International, LLC \n(Holtec)\u2014saw a business opportunity in this failure \nand sought to build above-ground storage facilities \nlarge enough to hold all of the nation\u2019s SNF on an \n\u201cinterim\u201d\u2014but effectively indefinite\u2014basis. ISP and \nHoltec chose the Permian Basin of eastern New \nMexico and west Texas, home to the most productive \noil field in the world and one of the nation\u2019s most \nthreatened \naquifers. \nThe \nNuclear \nRegulatory \nCommission (NRC) issued Holtec and ISP licenses to \noperate their facilities on 40-year renewable terms \nover objections from the host states and denied every \nattempt by opponents to intervene in the proceedings. \nRespondents sought judicial review of NRC\u2019s \nactions in the Fifth Circuit, which Petitioners fought \non both jurisdictional and merits grounds. Petitioners \nadvance a definition of \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under which \nNRC\u2019s actions effectively deny such status to its \nopponents and thus prevent judicial review. In light of \nNRC\u2019s suffocation of public participation in licensing \nproceedings, Petitioners\u2019 proposed definition of \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d effectively precludes the possibility of \njudicial review of NRC\u2019s final decisions. The Court \nshould not suffer such a misguided and self-interested \nposition, particularly when Congress has made clear \nthat a host state or tribe\u2019s disapproval of a proposed \n\n3 \n \n \nsite controls, unless overruled by Congress. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10135. \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 position, the \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d requirement in the Hobbs Act should be \nread to include all those who participated in the \nproceedings below. This reading accomplishes many \nimportant goals, including (a) satisfying congressional \nintent to subject final agency decisions to judicial \noversight and ensure that parties who are impacted \nby proceedings involving atomic energy and nuclear \nwaste are heard, (b) ensuring proper consideration of \nstates\u2019 critical environmental and safety concerns, \nand (c) preventing NRC\u2019s restrictive regulations from \nrendering meaningful challenge to agency action \npractically impossible. \nAlternatively, when NRC has exceeded its \nstatutory authority as it has in this case, a state \nshould be able to seek judicial review of NRC decisions \nunder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s established ultra vires \nexception. New Mexico and Michigan support and \necho Respondents\u2019 request to affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvacatur of ISP\u2019s license and urge the same affirmance \nof the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision on Holtec. \nARGUMENT \nCongress delegated to NRC the authority to license \nnuclear facilities and regulate their safety. In doing \nso, Congress struck an important balance: it gave \nNRC \u201ca virtually unique substantive freedom\u201d to \nresolve nuclear safety issues in exchange for \u201ca \nvirtually unique procedural responsibility\u201d to admit \ninterested parties to its proceedings and ensure \njudicial review. Richard Goldsmith, Regulatory \nReform & the Revival of Nuclear Power, 20 Hofstra L. \n\n4 \n \n \nRev. 159, 163-64 (1991). Indeed, NRC has a statutory \nduty to allow \u201cany person whose interest may be \naffected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under Chapter 23 of the \nAtomic Energy Act (AEA) to request and participate \nin a hearing, and thus become a \u201cparty to such \nproceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A) (emphases \nadded).  \nInstead of allowing all such interested parties to \nparticipate in its proceedings, however, NRC has \npromulgated an impenetrable thicket of procedural \nregulations, making intervention and participation in \nhearings all-but-impossible. Petitioners exacerbate \nthis problem by narrowly interpreting the Hobbs Act \nto permit only intervenors to seek redress in the Court \nof Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344; NRC Br. 13-14; ISP Br. \n16. Such an interpretation frustrates Congress\u2019s \ncommands that \u201c[a]ny final order entered in any \nproceeding\u201d\u2014including those at issue here\u2014\u201cshall be \nsubject to judicial review,\u201d1 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b) \n(emphasis added), and that \u201cany person whose \ninterest may be affected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under \nthe AEA should be heard, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A).  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s determination that it had \njurisdiction to review NRC\u2019s statutory authority to \n \n1 Contrary to NRC\u2019s suggestion, the NRC licensing \nprocess is not \u201cakin to litigation between two parties\u201d (NRC Br. \nat 27), nor is it an adversarial process. In an adversarial process, \njudicial review is ensured by the losing party\u2019s ability to \nchallenge the outcome. But in a licensing proceeding before NRC, \nunless intervention has been granted to a petitioner opposing the \nlicense, there is no losing party once NRC accepts the \napplication. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nmake the relevant siting decisions was correct, and its \ndecision should be affirmed.  \nI. THE \nCOURT \nSHOULD \nREAD \n\u201cPARTY \nAGGRIEVED\u201d \nIN \nLINE \nWITH \nCONGRESSIONAL INTENT, NOT NRC\u2019S \nARTIFICIALLY RESTRICTED VIEW.  \nA. Congress Intended \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d to \nInclude Anyone Aggrieved by a Final \nOrder, \nAcross \nAgencies \nand \nAdministrations.  \nCongress clearly stated that \u201c[a]ny final order \nentered in any proceeding\u201d \u201cshall be subject to judicial \nreview.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b)(1). Congress similarly \ncommanded that \u201cany person whose interest may be \naffected\u201d by \u201cany proceeding\u201d under the AEA should \nbe heard. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A).   \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly noted that \u201cthe function \nof the \u2018party aggrieved\u2019 status requirement is to \nensure that the agency had the opportunity to \nconsider the issue that petitioners are concerned \nwith.\u201d \nPet.App.17a \n(emphasis \nadded). \nIndeed, \n\u201cexecutive determinations generally are subject to \njudicial review,\u201d as is evident by the strong \n\u201cpresumption \nfavoring \njudicial \nreview \nof \nadministrative action.\u201d Gerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020) (citations omitted); see also \nLeedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190 (1958) (\u201cThis Court \ncannot lightly infer that Congress does not intend \njudicial protection of rights it confers against agency \naction taken in excess of delegated powers.\u201d); Dart v. \nUnited States, 848 F.2d 217, 221 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (\u201cIf \nthe wording of a preclusion clause is less than \nabsolute, . . . [j]udicial review is favored when an \n\n6 \n \n \nagency is charged with acting beyond its authority.\u201d); \ncf. Kirby Corp. v. Pe\u00f1a, 109 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir. \n1997) (noting that \u201cthe government bears a \u2018heavy \nburden\u2019 when arguing that Congress meant to \nprohibit all judicial review\u201d). \nIn short, if the agency had a chance to consider the \nissues now on review, then the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nstatus requirement has served its purpose. See Gage \nv. U.S. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1219 \n(D.C. Cir. 1973) (\u201cThe \u2018party\u2019 status requirement \noperates to preclude direct appellate court review \nwithout a record which at least has resulted from the \nfact-finder\u2019s focus on the alternative regulatory \nprovisions which petitioners propose.\u201d); ACA Int\u2019l v. \nFCC, 885 F.3d 687, 711-12 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(emphasizing the centrality of having presented a \nview to the agency to qualify as an aggrieved party). \nAs such, reading \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d to include those \nwho participated in agency proceedings and whose \ninterests may be affected by that agency\u2019s final orders \nsatisfies congressional intent. This question has \nrecurred across agencies and administrations, and \nmany courts have settled on this same reading. See, \ne.g., Massachusetts v. United States, 522 F.3d 115, 131 \n(1st Cir. 2008) (stating that whether one is a party \naggrieved for Hobbs Act purposes depends on whether \n\u201cthe would-be petitioner \u2018directly and actually \nparticipated in the administrative proceedings\u2019\u201d \n(quoting Clark & Reid Co. v. United States, 804 F.2d \n3, 5 (1st Cir. 1986))); Reytblatt v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Comm\u2019n, 105 F.3d 715, 720 (D.C.

Rather, the power \nto construe who is a \u201cparty\u201d to a Hobbs Act petition is \nreserved for the Court. See Clark, 804 F.2d at 6. And \nit is for Congress, not an agency, to strip federal courts \nof the power of such review. See Kucana v. Holder, 558 \nU.S. 233, 251-52 (2010).  \nHere, Texas participated in NRC\u2019s proceedings by \nsubmitting comments on the draft Environmental \n\n8 \n \n \nImpact Statement (EIS), and Fasken participated by \nattempting intervention. NRC certainly had plenty of \nopportunities to consider the issues that aggrieved \nFasken, Texas, and other commentors.2 Texas and \nFasken are \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under a plain \nlanguage reading of the Hobbs Act and in accordance \nwith congressional intent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344; see also, \ne.g., Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, & Transp. \nWorkers v.

And as the Fifth Circuit observed in \ndenying en banc review, allowing NRC to \u201ccontrol[] \nthe courthouse door\u201d by confining access to judicial \nreview to successful intervenors would violate \nfundamental principles governing review of agency \ndecisions. Pet.App.34a. NRC\u2019s suggested definition of \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act\u2014under which \nonly license applicants and successful intervenors \nqualify\u2014would permit NRC\u2019s own overly-restrictive \nprocedural standards for intervention to bar judicial \nreview of its actions. A plain language reading in \naccordance with congressional intent is far superior. \n \n2 This is particularly so when the NWPA requires \nconsultation with states on SNF issues, and Texas attempted to \nprovide such consultation. See Pet.App.40a (\u201c[T]he NWPA \nspecifically required \u2018consultation\u2019 with the states before siting of \n[SNF] may occur anywhere.\u201d (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10155(d)(1)-(2))). \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nB. This \nReading \nEnsures \nProper \nConsideration \nof \nImportant \nState \nInterests. \nIn addition, this plain reading allows for \nconsideration of serious environmental and safety \nconcerns regarding the proposed \u201cinterim\u201d SNF \nstorage facilities at issue here.  \nIn the present context, the narrow reading \nadvanced by Petitioners would preclude proper \nconsideration of the serious concerns raised by Texas, \nFasken, New Mexico, and others affected by siting \ndeterminations for SNF facilities. Affected parties \ntried to raise concerns in the NRC proceedings, but \nNRC overrode host states\u2019 and others\u2019 concerns and \nissued the licenses. This is a final determination that \nshould be subject to judicial review.  \nParticularly concerning to Amici, Texas, New \nMexico, and other entities raised various concerns \nwith licensing SNF storage facilities in the Permian \nBasin due to its unsuitable geology, valuable \nresources, and national security risk. They also \nsubmitted comments on the draft EIS in the Holtec \nand ISP licensing proceedings covering the gamut of \nsafety, environmental, economic, and social issues, \ndiscussed below. New Mexico even attempted to \naddress its concerns through collaboration with NRC \nin the Holtec proceedings by entering into a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) with NRC (at \nNRC\u2019s invitation) to assist it with preparation of the \nHoltec EIS. See MOU between NMED and NRC \n(dated \nJuly \n24, \n2019), \navailable \nat \n\n10 \n \n \nhttps://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1920/ML19206A094.pdf. \nNMED provided comments on working versions of \nNRC\u2019s draft EIS per the MOU, including raising \nconcerns about the inadequacy of EIS\u2019s analysis of \ngroundwater and geology issues around the site. As \nwith other comments and objections submitted to \nNRC, these were ignored.  \nNRC\u2019s decision to license the facilities over such \nobjections violated Congress\u2019s command that a host \nstate or tribe\u2019s disapproval of a proposed site controls, \nunless overruled by Congress. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10135. \nFederal courts must be able to step in and reverse \nNRC when it acts contrary to congressional intent. \nThis is all the more important when dealing with \nsome of the serious and substantial concerns that \nwere raised by the participants in the present case, \ndiscussed below. \ni. \nDe Facto permanent repositories  \nAmong \nthe \nvarious \nsafety, \nenvironmental, \neconomic, and social issues raised in the NRC \nproceedings, one of the most concerning to Amici is \nthat, notwithstanding its designation as \u201cinterim,\u201d the \nISP facility is a de facto permanent repository for \nSNF. \nNew \nMexico \nGovernor \nLujan \nGrisham \ncommented that, \u201c[w]ith no active planning for a \npermanent repository for SNF underway, there is \nsignificant risk that this and other facilities proposed \nas interim storage facilities become de facto \npermanent repositories,\u201d J.A.212. Texas Governor \nAbbott stated that it would be \u201cna\u00efve to believe\u201d that \nthe proposed facilities are \u201cinterim\u201d and that the \npossibility of a permanent repository in sixty years is \na \u201crosy assumption[],\u201d J.A.120.  \n\n11 \n \n \nThese concerns are not unfounded. NRC itself has \nrevised its \u201cfindings\u201d over the years about when a \npermanent geologic repository for SNF would become \navailable. See Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear \nFuel, 79 Fed. Reg. 56,238, 56,240-41 (Sept. 19, 2014). \nMost recently in 2010, NRC downgraded those \npromises to an assertion that a permanent repository \nwould be available only \u201cwhen necessary.\u201d Id. at \n56,241. Following the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur of the \n2010 version of that rule, New York v. N.R.C., 681 \nF.3d 471 (D.C. Cir. 2012), NRC stopped making such \npredictions, instead promulgating a rule to preclude \ndiscussion of the environmental impacts of the \ncontinued indefinite storage of SNF \u201cbeyond the \nlicensed life for operation of a reactor,\u201d and supplant \nsite-specific considerations with a \u201cgeneric\u201d EIS. 79 \nFed. Reg. at 56,238; see also First Am. Compl. at 16-\n17, \u00b6\u00b6 67-76, ECF No. 7 (filed May 17, 2021), in State \nex rel. Balderas v. U.S. Nuclear Regul.

As recently as \n \n\n14 \n \n \niii. \nEnvironmental justice \nNew Mexico and its stakeholders raised profound \nconcerns about the environmental justice impact of \nboth the ISP and Holtec facilities. \n[I]ndefinite storage of commercial SNF joins \nthe ranks of uranium mining and milling, legacy \ncontamination at national laboratories, and \ndisposal of defense waste at the Waste Isolation \nPilot Plan (WIPP), all of which have long presented \nrisks to [New Mexico\u2019s] public health and the \nenvironment in the State of New Mexico.  \nJ.A.182 (NMED comment on ISP draft EIS).  \nNMED also objected that the draft EIS failed to \nconsider the \u201chigh percentage of minority and low-\nincome populations in . . . New Mexico who have \nalready suffered disproportionately high adverse \nhuman health and environmental effects from nuclear \nenergy and weapons programs of the United States.\u201d \nJ.A.184. Such objections were ultimately disregarded. \nThe \nBoard \nalso \nrejected \nthe \nAlliance \nfor \nEnvironmental Strategies\u2019 environmental justice \nchallenge in Holtec because NRC needed only to \n\u201cidentify minority and low-income populations near \nproposed nuclear sites so that it can determine \nwhether the environmental impacts associated with a \ngiven site will be different for those populations when \n \n2021, the DOE reaffirmed its intent to \u201cbuild trust and \nconfidence with stakeholders and the public by demonstrating a \nconsent-based approach to siting.\u201d Notice of Request for Info. \n(RFI) on Using a Consent-Based Siting Process to Identify Fed. \nInterim Storage Facilities, 86 Fed. Reg. 68,244, 68,245 (Dec. 1, \n2021). \n\n15 \n \n \ncompared to the general population of the surrounding \narea, not the country as a whole.\u201d Holtec, 91 N.R.C. at \n198 \n(emphasis \nadded). \nBy \ncomparing \nthe \ndemographics of the proposed site with \u201csurrounding \narea[s],\u201d instead of with that of the United States as a \nwhole, NRC all but ensured that a minority-majority \nstate\u2014like Amicus New Mexico\u2014would never be able \nto successfully raise environmental justice concerns. \nSee J.A.183 (NMED noting that the ISP draft EIS \n\u201cidentifies 58.8 percent of the population in Lea \nCounty, New Mexico as Hispanic or Latino,\u201d which is \n\u201csignificantly greater than in the United States\u2019 \ngeneral population\u201d).  \nSimilarly, in the ISP proceeding, NRC rejected the \nSierra Club\u2019s concerns that ISP used only a four-mile \nradius around the site to determine the \u201clevel of \nminority population,\u201d when a fifty-mile radius would \nhave been more appropriate from an environmental-\njustice perspective. ISP, 90 N.R.C. 31, 83 (2019). NRC \nfaulted the Sierra Club for \u201cfail[ing] to show how ISP\u2019s \ncompliance with NRC guidance violates NEPA or \nNRC regulations,\u201d and characterized the wider radius \n(used for the Yucca Mountain EIS) as the Sierra \nClub\u2019s \u201cprefer[ence].\u201d Id. at 84. \nNRC and the Board also rejected concerns based in \ncommunity support or opposition. For example, the \nBoard stated that \u201ccommunity support or opposition \nin a license application does not lend any weight to the \nenvironmental justice analysis to be conducted by the \napplicant,\u201d ultimately finding that Holtec followed \nNRC guidance on environmental justice analysis. \nHoltec, 89 N.R.C. 353, 457 (2019).  \n\n16 \n \n \nFinally, New Mexico is especially concerned that \nNRC denied intervention to any petitioner that raised \nenvironmental justice concerns even though NRC \nknew about the cumulative impact of already-existing \nnuclear-related projects in the area, conceding in both \nfacilities\u2019 final EISs that the combined impact of all \nthese nuclear facilities \u201ccould potentially contribute to \ncumulative disproportionately high and adverse \nhuman health or environmental effects within 80 km \n[50 mi] of the proposed CISF project.\u201d ISP Final EIS \nat 5-48; Holtec Final EIS at 5-45; see also ISP Final \nEIS at 5-49 (pointing the finger to Holtec\u2019s impact on \nenvironmental justice and failing to consider the \ncumulative impact); Holtec Final EIS at 5-43 (same as \nto ISP). \niv. \nTerrorism concerns \nStoring the nation\u2019s SNF on the world\u2019s largest \nproducing oilfield in the Permian Basin would pose \nsignificant risks of terrorist attacks. New Mexico \nechoed Texas Governor Abbott\u2019s concerns on this \npoint. J.A.118-19 (Governor Abbott\u2019s comments); id. \nat 213 (Governor Lujan Grisham\u2019s comments). As \nGovernor Abbott explained, \u201c[p]iling [SNF] up on the \nsurface of the Permian Basin . . . would allow a \nterrorist with a bomb or a hijacked aircraft to cause a \nmajor radioactive release,\u201d which, \u201con top of the tragic \nloss of human life,\u201d \u201cwould disrupt the country\u2019s \nenergy supply by shutting down the world\u2019s largest \nproducing oilfield.\u201d J.A.118-19. NRC held that \u201cno \nterrorism analysis under NEPA is required\u201d outside \nthe Ninth Circuit, ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 108, and \nexplained in the Holtec proceedings that \u201cterrorist \nattacks are too far removed from the natural or \nexpected consequences of agency action to require \n\n17 \n \n \nenvironmental \nanalysis \nin \nan \nNRC \nlicensing \nproceeding,\u201d Holtec, 91 N.R.C. at 210. Still, New \nMexico\u2019s concerns about increased risk of terrorism \nremain. \nv. \nCanisters\u2019 age and risk of leaking  \nNMED commented that the \u201cSNF cannisters that \nwould be shipped to the proposed ISP facility have \nalready been stored for decades,\u201d J.A.180, and \nelaborated that \u201c[t]he Design Life for the storage \nfacility and cask, canisters, and assemblies is eighty \n(80) years\u201d while \u201c[t]he Service Life for the SNF \nstorage site is one hundred and twenty (120) years,\u201d \nJ.A.175; see also GAO, Commercial Spent Nuclear \nFuel \nat \n29, \nGA0-21-603, \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-603.pdf \n(\u201c[T]he \nsafety of long-term dry cask storage is unknown, and \nthe risks, such as environmental and health risks, of \non-site storage increase the longer the fuel is stored.\u201d).  \nThe \nSierra \nClub \nlikewise \nnoted \nthat \nthe \n\u201ccontainers in which the waste will be transported to \nand stored at the ISP site are licensed for a period of \n20 years,\u201d but \u201cmany of the containers will already \nhave been in service for years prior to being shipped \nto the ISP.\u201d ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 80. The Sierra Club \nraised related concerns that \u201cstorage of high burnup \nfuel and seismic events from hydraulic fracturing in \nthe area would crack a canister.\u201d Id. at 74. Fasken \nsimilarly commented on ISP\u2019s draft EIS that recent \nstudies have shown that the \u201cphenomenon\u201d of \nChloride-Induced Stress Corrosion Cracking (CISCC) \nof welded storage canisters is likely to occur at the ISP \nand Holtec sites\u2014that is, \u201cin the midst of the massive \nSalado (\u2018Salt\u2019) Formation.\u201d J.A.151; see id. at 152-60 \n\n18 \n \n \n(discussing threat of CISCC in these areas, recent \nresearch on the phenomenon, and NRC\u2019s own public \nstatements about such a risk). Fasken highlighted the \nDOE\u2019s and NRC\u2019s \u201crevised research priorities that \nclearly show\u201d their concern with CISCC. J.A.160. \nThe Board dismissed the Sierra Club\u2019s contention \nregarding cracked canisters because it was \u201cin essence \na challenge to NRC\u2019s cask certificate of compliance \n(CoC) program and is thus outside the scope of this \nproceeding.\u201d ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 74. And NRC refused \nto admit contentions about the canisters\u2019 safety, \nclaiming that they \u201cimpermissibly challenge the \nContinued Storage Rule and [we]re therefore outside \nthe scope of this proceeding.\u201d Id. at 67; see id. at 81, \n101 (same). \nRelatedly, the Sierra Club contended that the \ncanisters might leak at some point. NRC deemed the \nSierra Club\u2019s concerns inadmissible because \u201cthe \nCommission\u2019s decision in Private Fuel Storage \nestablished that cracked and leaking canisters in \nstorage, transport, or otherwise is not a credible \nscenario,\u201d id. at 80-81 (citing Private Fuel Storage, 60 \nN.R.C. 125, 136-37 (2004)), even though that assertion \nrelies on the 1995 Emergency Planning Rule, 60 Fed. \nReg. 32,430 (June 22, 1995), which predates most of \nthe canister designs at issue in the ISP proceeding. \nCompare ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 81 n.336 (listing six cask \nsystems approved by ISP and their certificate of \ncompliance numbers), with 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.214 (listing \ninitial certification years for four of these six cask \ndesign systems as 2000, 2003, and 2009).  \n\n19 \n \n \nvi. \nRepackaging and further transport \nPetitioners in the ISP proceeding also raised \ncontentions about repackaging SNF and transporting \nit to a final geological repository, pointing out \nconcomitant additional safety risks. These concerns \nwere echoed by the states in comments. See, e.g., \nJ.A.175 (\u201c[M]oving SNF multiple times increases the \nlikelihood of accidents within the State of New Mexico \nand elsewhere.\u201d); id. at 213 (\u201cTransporting [SNF] \nacross \nthe \nnation is \ncomplex \nand \nextremely \ndangerous.\u201d).   \nIn one instance, the Board dismissed such a \ncontention on the basis that the ISP license is \u201cfor a \n40-year license\u201d and therefore its environmental \nreport \u201crelies on the Continued Storage Rule and \nContinued Storage [Generic ]EIS.\u201d ISP, 90 N.R.C. at \n92. Without acknowledging the inevitable necessity \nfor repackaging, the Board parroted that \u201cISP\u2019s \napplication does not set forth any intent to repackage \nspent fuel or any analysis of the costs of repackaging \nthe fuel\u201d and that \u201cthe Continued Storage Rule does \nnot require a spent fuel storage facility applicant \nunder Part 72 to include such an analysis beyond the \nlicense term.\u201d Id. The Board concluded that such a \ncontention was \u201coutside the scope of this proceeding.\u201d \nId. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the denial of \nintervention in the Holtec proceeding on an identical \ncontention, because the petitioners \u201cidentif[ied] no \nlegal requirement for a dry transfer system [(a method \nof repackaging)] at Holtec\u2019s facility, under the \nContinued Storage Rule or otherwise.\u201d Beyond \nNuclear, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 113 \nF.4th 956, 968 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  \n\n20 \n \n \nAlso in the ISP proceeding, petitioner Sustainable \nEnergy and Economic Development Coalition raised \nconcerns \nabout \nthe \nsafety \nrisks \ninherent \nin \ntransporting SNF to the site. But NRC held that those \nconcerns were \u201coutside the scope of th[at] proceeding,\u201d \nstating that \u201cISP did not seek approval for waste \ntransportation, packaging, or repackaging activities\u201d \nand that \u201cthe title holders of [SNF]\u2014which include \nprivate \ncompanies\u2014would \nbe \nresponsible \nfor \ntransporting waste to the proposed facility, not ISP.\u201d \nISP, 92 N.R.C. 457, 460 (2020). NRC further rejected \nany challenge to transportation safety as an \nimpermissible attack on 10 C.F.R. Part 71. Id.  \nvii. \nEmergency response burdens  \nFinally, various petitioners raised concerns with \nthe burden that would be placed on emergency \nresponse personnel both near the facilities and en \nroute to them. \u201cSafe transportation of [SNF] requires \nboth well-maintained infrastructure and highly \nspecialized emergency response equipment and \npersonnel that can respond quickly to an incident at \nthe facility or on transit routes.\u201d J.A.213. As Governor \nLujan Grisham stated, \u201cNew Mexico residents cannot \nafford and should not be expected to bear the costs \nassociated with transporting material to the proposed \nCISF or responding to an accident on transport routes \nor near the facility.\u201d Id. \nNRC rejected these concerns, finding it was both \ntoo early and too late to raise them. See, e.g., Holtec, \n91 N.R.C. at 209 (affirming the Board\u2019s decision that \n\u201cJoint Petitioners\u2019 concerns that emergency response \nofficials would need disclosure of transportation \nroutes [were] outside the scope of th[e] licensing \n\n21 \n \n \nproceeding\u201d because \u201cNRC reviews and approves \n[SNF] transportation routes separately\u201d); ISP, 93 \nN.R.C. 244, 248 (2021) (affirming the Board\u2019s decision \nthat Fasken should have raised emergency-response \ncosts earlier because, like the draft EIS, ISP\u2019s \nenvironmental report \u201calso omitted that information \nand Fasken did not challenge the omission\u201d). Indeed, \nNRC took the view that \u201c[s]tates are . . . responsible \nfor protecting public health and safety during \ntransportation \naccidents \ninvolving \nradioactive \nmaterials.\u201d ISP Final EIS at 4-74 to -75. NRC rejected \npetitioners\u2019 concerns based on NRC\u2019s position that \n\u201chow the States may distribute funding for first \nresponder \ntraining \nand \nequipment \nto \nlocal \nmunicipalities is not within NRC\u2019s authority and is \nbeyond the scope of this EIS.\u201d Id.  \n* * * \nAll told, myriad grave objections were raised \nthroughout the NRC proceedings. NRC consistently \nrejected such concerns, ultimately issuing licenses for \nSNF facilities despite host-state objections. NRC\u2019s \nproposed definition of \u201caggrieved party\u201d\u2014which \nprecludes objectors, commentors, and attempted \nintervenors from seeking judicial review of its final \ndeterminations\u2014not only violates logic, the plain \nreading of the statute, and congressional intent, but \nalso prevents necessary judicial review of safety, \nenvironmental, economic, and social issues that \nimpact participants, states, and the country as a \nwhole. \n \n\n22 \n \n \nC. The Correct Reading of \u201cParty Aggrieved\u201d \nAlso \nPrevents \nNRC\u2019s \nRestrictive \nRegulations from Rendering Meaningful \nChallenge to Agency Action Practically \nImpossible. \nNRC\u2019s 1989 promulgation of procedural rules \nlimiting intervention and participation in licensing \nproceedings were popular with industry, but not the \npublic. Summarizing comments on the proposed rule, \nNRC observed that \u201cvarious industry groups\u201d \nsupported \nthe \nrulemaking \nbecause \nit \n\u201cwould \nstreamline the hearing process and make it more \nefficient.\u201d Rules of Prac. for Domestic Licensing \nProc.\u2014Procedural Changes in the Hearing Process, 54 \nFed. Reg. 33,168, 33,168 (Aug. 11, 1989). By contrast, \n\u201c[s]tates, local governments, public interest groups, \nintervenors and individuals generally opposed the \nproposals on the ground that they would curtail the \npublic\u2019s role in the licensing process and meaningful \npublic participation in licensing proceedings would be \neliminated.\u201d Id. In short, the \u201ccentral thrust of the \nnew rules was to make intervention and participation \nin the Commission\u2019s licensing proceedings more \ndifficult.\u201d Goldsmith, 20 Hofstra at 191.7  \n \n7 Until now, NRC\u2019s procedural regulations constricting \nintervention have been blessed by the D.C. Circuit under the \nauspices of the Chevron doctrine. See Union of Concerned \nScientists v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 920 F.2d 50, 52 (D.C. \nCir. 1990) (denying challenge to 1989 procedural rules); Nat. Res. \nDef. Council v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 823 F.3d 641, 649 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (evaluating NRC\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the AEA\u2019s \nhearing requirement under the familiar two-step Chevron \nanalysis\u201d and citing Union of Concerned Scientists for the court\u2019s \n\u201coblig[ation] to defer to the operating procedures employed by an \n \n\n23 \n \n \nAs discussed in more detail below, NRC\u2019s \nprocedural rules constrict public participation in four \nways relevant here. The rules (i) impose heightened \npleading standards that shift the burden of proof to \nthe intervention petitioner; (ii) prevent challenges to \nsafety issues decided in generic rulemakings; (iii) \nrender review of NEPA issues even more remote; and \n(iv) make reopening the record almost impossible. As \nsuch, adopting NRC\u2019s proposed reading of \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d would not only violate principles of \nstatutory interpretation and congressional intent, but \nalso prevent proper consideration of important state \ninterests through judicial review. \ni. \nHeightened pleading standards \nThe hurdles that a state or any petitioner must \nmeet to be considered for intervention in an NRC \nproceeding are high. Assuming a petitioner can \ndemonstrate regulatory standing under 10 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 2.309(d), subsection (f) requires that a petitioner \n\u201cset forth with particularity the contentions sought to \nbe raised,\u201d and for each contention, the request must \n\u201c[p]rovide a specific statement of the issue of law or \nfact to be raised or controverted.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 2.309(f)(1). These contentions must remain \u201cwithin \nthe scope of the proceeding,\u201d and so not raise any \ngeneric safety concerns NRC deems previously \n \nagency\u201d). But neither the D.C. Circuit nor this Court have \nrevisited NRC\u2019s procedural regulatory scheme since this Court \noverruled Chevron last year. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, \n___ U.S. ___, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024). Beyond Nuclear, 113 F.4th \n956, was briefed before Loper Bright, so no Chevron-based \narguments were before the D.C. Circuit. After Loper Bright, \nNRC\u2019s procedural rules are no longer entitled to deference, \nparticularly when the agency uses them to abrogate the \nstatutory right to judicial review as explained more fully below. \n\n24 \n \n \ndetermined in a rulemaking, \u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(iii); see \n\u00a7 I(C)(ii), infra, and the \u201cissue raised in the \ncontention\u201d must be \u201cmaterial to the findings NRC \nmust make to support the action that is involved in \nthe proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(iv).   \nA petitioner must also\u2014in the short window of \nsixty days after notice of the application is \npublished\u2014\u201c[p]rovide a concise statement of the \nalleged facts or expert opinions which support the \nrequestor\u2019s/petitioner\u2019s position on the issue and on \nwhich the petitioner intends to rely at hearing,\u201d and \ninclude \u201creferences to the specific sources and \ndocuments on which the requestor/petitioner intends \nto rely to support its position on the issue.\u201d \n\u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(v). The petitioner must \u201cshow that a \ngenuine dispute exists with the applicant/licenses on \na material issue of law or fact,\u201d which materiality \nNRC constrains by defining the scope of the licensing \nproceeding narrowly. \u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(vi).  \nIn short, a petitioner must effectively prove its case \non the merits as a condition of intervention. See 54 \nFed. Reg. at 33,169 (summarizing comments that \u201cone \nimmediate effect of the proposed amendments would \nbe to shift the burden of proof from the license \napplicant to the intervenor,\u201d which is particularly \nunfair when, by contrast, \u201clicense applicants are not \nrequired to furnish all the necessary documentation \nsupporting the application at the time the application \nis first submitted\u201d).  \nTo achieve such a feat in such a timeframe would \nbe extraordinary. This is particularly noteworthy \nwhen no similar time-limited requirements are \nimposed on license applicants, who instead work \n\n25 \n \n \ncollaboratively with NRC staff to finesse their \napplications. See, e.g., NRC, Holtec International - HI-\nSTORE CISF, available at https://www.nrc.gov/\nwaste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/holtec-international.\nhtml (showing numerous rounds of requests and \nresponse between NRC staff and Holtec, during and \nafter the 60-day period for intervention petitions); \nNRC, \nInterim \nStorage \nPartners, \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/\nwaste-control-specialist.html (same for ISP).  \nSuch draconian demands no doubt played a role in \nthe complete lack of successful interventions in the \nHoltec and ISP proceedings. ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 42 \n(stating that none of the over forty proffered \ncontentions met NRC\u2019s standards for a hearing); id. at \n118 (denying all contentions but one, which was \ndenied in another proceeding); Holtec, 89 N.R.C. at \n358 (\u201cBecause no petitioner has both demonstrated \nstanding and proffered an admissible contention, this \nproceeding is terminated.\u201d (emphasis added)); Beyond \nNuclear, 113 F.4th at 970 (affirming NRC\u2019s denials in \nHoltec); Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, No. 21-1048, 2023 WL 395030 (D.C. Cir. Jan. \n25, 2023) (same for ISP). \nMoreover, timely intervention becomes even more \nonerous because the license application becomes a \nmoving target at which the petitioner has one (early) \nshot. Although a petitioner must base its contentions \non the applicant\u2019s initial environmental report, safety \nanalysis, and license application, by the time the \nBoard is reviewing a petitioner\u2019s contentions, NRC \nhas already responded to deficiencies in the license \napplication and given the applicant multiple chances \n\n26 \n \n \nto correct, supplement, and amend the application. \nSee generally NRC online dockets for Holtec and ISP. \nSo, a contention that was admissible under 10 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 2.309 at the time it was filed (within the 60-\nday window), may not remain so after the application \nhas been revised. See, e.g., ISP, 90 N.R.C. at 91 \n(affirming the Board\u2019s ruling that \u201cintervening \ndevelopments have mooted\u201d certain of the joint \npetitioners\u2019 claims); id. at 105 (holding that joint \npetitioners\u2019 concerns were mooted when ISP withdrew \nits request for a certain exemption). This one-sided \nleniency \nstacks the \ndeck \neven \nmore \nagainst \npetitioners for intervention.  \nii. \nNear \nimpossibility \nof \nintervention \nbased on safety issues \nEven if one were able to make it past the \nheightened pleading standards, safety issues are \nvirtually impossible to challenge in a licensing \nproceeding. NRC regulations prohibit an \u201cattack\u201d in \nthe form \u201cof discovery, proof, argument, or other \nmeans\u201d on any \u201crule or regulation of [NRC] . . . \nconcerning the licensing of production and utilization \nfacilities . . . in any adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d 10 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 2.335(a). This means that generic safety or \ndesign rules cannot be challenged in a licensing \nproceeding, even if those generic rules do not consider \nsite-specific factors that may be relevant, such as the \nnearby presence of fracking-induced seismic activity, \nsalt dust storms, or pollutants from other nearby \nindustrial operations.  \nIn other words, NRC rejects any contentions that \nraise issues beyond NRC\u2019s self-determined scope of a \nlicensing proceeding. See, e.g., ISP, 90 N.R.C. 358, \n\n27 \n \n \n367-68 (Dec. 13, 2019) (rejecting contention that \nraised \u201csafety-related transportation issues\u201d because \n\u201cISP has committed to accepting at its facility only \ntransportation packages that have been approved by \nthe NRC and licensed under Part 71,\u201d and \u201csuch \nclaims try to expand a Part 72 application process into \na dispute over the adequacy of the NRC\u2019s Part 71 \nrequirements\u201d). This issue has caught the attention of \nthe Government Accountability Office: \u201c[S]ome \ntransportation issues associated with consolidated \ninterim storage have not been considered because \n[SNF] \nmanagement \nis \ncompartmentalized.\u201d \nCommercial Spent Nuclear Fuel: Congressional Action \nNeeded to Break Impasse & Develop a Permanent \nDisposal Solution at 31, GA0-21-603 (Sept. 2021), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-\n603.pdf.  \nIn fact, the only way to challenge a generic \nrulemaking in an adjudicatory proceeding, whether \non safety issues or canister design, is by obtaining a \nwaiver under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.335. Among other things, \nNRC requires that \u201c[t]he sole ground for petition of \nwaiver or exception is that special circumstances with \nrespect to the subject matter of the particular \nproceeding are such that the application of the rule or \nregulation (or a provision of it) would not serve the \npurposes for which the rule or regulation was \nadopted.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.335(b) (emphasis added). \nAlthough that requirement may seem reasonable, at \nleast in some rules, NRC can write the \u201cpurpose\u201d \nstatement with this waiver in mind. See, e.g., \nContinued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, 79 Fed. Reg. \n56,238, 56,239 (Sep. 19, 2014) (\u201cThe purpose of this \nfinal rule . . . is to preserve the efficiency of the NRC\u2019s \nlicensing process.\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, a \n\n28 \n \n \npetitioner hoping to intervene and challenge any issue \nNRC deems already addressed by the Continued \nStorage Rule may only do so if its waiver petition \nargues that applying the Rule runs counter to the \n\u201cefficiency\u201d of NRC\u2019s proceedings.  \nSuch a requirement renders intervention on \ngenerically determined safety or design issues nearly \nimpossible. See Exelon Generation Co., LLC, 78 N.R.C. \n199, 207 (Oct. 31, 2013) (NRC acknowledging that its \n\u201cwaiver standard is stringent by design. . . . When \n[NRC] engage[s] in rulemaking, [it is] \u2018carving out\u2019 \nissues from adjudication for generic resolution.\u201d \n(footnotes omitted)). Indeed, \u201cto challenge the generic \napplication of a rule, a petitioner seeking waiver must \nshow that there is something extraordinary about the \nsubject matter of the proceeding such that the rule \nshould not apply.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). NRC has \n\u201crarely, if ever, granted a petition for waiver.\u201d Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, 823 F.3d at 649. Here, NRC used \nvarious petitioners\u2019 failure to seek a waiver as a \nreason to deny contentions that challenged various \naspects of the EIS. \niii. \nIntervention on NEPA issues must be \nobtained before a draft EIS is even \npublished \nYet another hurdle to intervention is NRC\u2019s \nrequirement that any NEPA-related contentions be \nbased on information in the applicant\u2019s initial \nenvironmental report. See 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309(f)(2). \nBecause a draft EIS is rarely available while the \nrecord is open, a would-be NEPA commenter does not \nhave access to it at the time contentions must be filed. \nIn the ISP proceedings, for example, the record closed \n\n29 \n \n \nat the end of October 2018, but the draft EIS was not \npublished until May 2020. Compare Interim Storage \nPartner\u2019s Waste Control Specialists Consolidated \nInterim Storage Facility, 83 Fed. Reg. 44,070, 44,070 \n(Aug. 29, 2018) (announcing start of intervention \nperiod), with 85 Fed. Reg. 27,447, 27,447 (May 8, \n2020) (announcing publication of draft EIS for public \ncomment).  \nMoreover, successful intervention is a pre-\nrequisite for obtaining judicial review of NEPA \nclaims. See Ohio Nuclear-free Network v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm\u2019n, 53 F.4th 236, 240 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(dismissing NEPA objections for failure to obtain \nparty status under Hobbs Act). Thus, by yoking NEPA \nchallenges to its unfairly constrained adjudicatory \nprocess, NRC precludes judicial review of the EIS that \nwould otherwise be separately available under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). See Friends of \nLydia Ann Channel v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 701 \nFed. Appx. 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2017) (noting that \n\u201cFederal courts have long exercised jurisdiction over \nNEPA challenges pursuant to the APA\u201d). \niv. \nStandards to reopen the record are \neven harder to meet \nFinally, although NRC theoretically offers an \nopportunity to reopen a closed record to request a \nhearing, this motion must meet additional heightened \ncriteria: \u201cA motion to reopen a closed record to \nconsider additional evidence will not be granted\u201d \nunless the motion presents \u201can exceptionally grave \nissue,\u201d \n\u201caddress[es] \na \nsignificant \nsafety \nor \nenvironmental issue,\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[s] that a \nmaterially different result would be or would have \n\n30 \n \n \nbeen likely had the newly proffered evidence been \nconsidered initially.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.326(a)(1)-(3) \n(emphasis added). Not only that, but the \u201cmotion must \nbe accompanied by affidavits that set forth the factual \nand/or technical bases for the movant\u2019s claim,\u201d and \u201cbe \ngiven by competent individuals with knowledge of the \nfacts alleged, or by experts in the disciplines \nappropriate to the issues raised.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.326(b). \nNo attempts to reopen the record in either Holtec or \nISP were successful. See, e.g., ISP, 93 N.R.C. at 248 \n(affirming the Board\u2019s denial of Fasken\u2019s motion to \nreopen the record); Holtec\u00b8 91 N.R.C. 239, 251-52 \n(2020) (denying Sierra Club\u2019s motion to reopen).  \n* * * \nBy erecting artificial barriers to participation, \nNRC has stacked the deck against states and \norganizations that will be affected by siting decisions \nfor SNF storage. All told, NRC\u2019s procedural rules \nmake public participation in licensing proceedings \nalmost impossible. Judicial review of NRC licensing \ndeterminations would therefore be unattainable \nunder \na \nstandard \nthat \nrequires \nsuccessful \nintervention as a prerequisite to \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nstatus under the Hobbs Act. The Court should instead \nfollow \nCongress\u2019s \nclearly \nexpressed \nintent \nby \npermitting \nparties \nwho \nparticipated \nin \nNRC \nproceedings to challenge its decisions in court. \n\n31 \n \n \nII. ALTERNATIVELY, THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \nCORRECTLY DETERMINED THAT THE \nULTRA VIRES EXCEPTION PROPERLY \nPRESERVES JUDICIAL REVIEW OF NRC \nACTIONS.  \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to resolve the question \nof whether Respondents are aggrieved parties under \nthe Hobbs Act, see Pet.App.18a, instead deciding the \nquestion of standing based on an already-established \nultra vires exception to the Hobbs Act. Specifically, \nthe Fifth Circuit held that Respondents had standing \nto challenge the license when, as relevant here, \u201cthe \nagency action is attacked as exceeding [its] power,\u201d id. \nat 18a-19a (citing Am. Trucking Ass\u2019n v. Interstate \nCom. Comm\u2019n, 673 F.2d 82, 85 n.4 (5th Cir. 1982)). \nAmici agree with the Fifth Circuit that an ultra \nvires exception to the \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nis necessary when an agency exceeds its statutory \nauthority. Here, NRC exceeded its statutory authority \nby (i) licensing so-called consolidated interim storage \nfacilities for SNF, even though the AEA gives it no \nsuch authority, and even though the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982 (NWPA) makes exclusive provision \nfor permanent geologic storage of the nation\u2019s nuclear \nwaste through a process of consultation with affected \nStates; and (ii)  promulgating procedural regulations \nthat abrogate the AEA\u2019s command that any person \nwhose interest may be affected by an NRC proceeding \nmay request and participate in a hearing, and that \njudicial review shall be available of any final action. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(b). As such, the ultra vires \nexception is warranted. \n\n32 \n \n \nDeciding this case under the ultra vires exception \nis also appropriate given the history and rationale of \nthis exception: the Hobbs Act is the successor to older \nstatutes \noriginally \ngoverning \nthe \nnow-defunct \nInterstate \nCommerce \nCommission \n(ICC). \nSee \nInterstate Commerce Act of 1887, P.L. 49-104, 24 \nStat. 379 (creating the ICC); Mann-Elkins Act, P.L. \n61-218, 36 Stat. 539, ch. 309 (1910) (creating a \nCommerce Court to review decisions of the ICC); \nUrgent Deficiencies Act of 1913, ch. 32 P.L. 63-32, 38 \nStat. 208, 219-21 (1913) (replacing the Commerce \nCourt with three-judge district-court panels, while \nmaintaining the procedures created by the Mann-\nElkins Act); see, e.g., Jason Sigalos, The Other Hobbs \nAct: An Old Leviathan in the Modern Administrative \nState, 54 GA. L. REV. 1095 (2020) (discussing the \nlegislative history of the act). The Hobbs Act replaced \ndistrict court panels with direct Court of Appeals \nreview, and extended it to other agencies, including \nNRC.  \nThe Interstate Commerce Act did not contain any \nprovision for judicial review. The Mann-Elkins Act \nand Urgent Deficiencies Act, like the Hobbs Act, \nlimited \nparticipation \nin \nsubsequent \njudicial \nproceedings to \u201cthe [ICC] and any party or parties in \ninterest to the proceeding before the commission, in \nwhich an order or requirement is made.\u201d 36 Stat. at \n543 (emphasis added); see 38 Stat at 220 (\u201cThe \nprocedure in the district courts in respect to cases of \nwhich jurisdiction is conferred upon them by the Act \nshall be the same as that heretofore prevailing in the \nCommerce Court [under the Mann-Elkins Act].\u201d). \nNonetheless, this Court has consistently allowed \njudicial review under those Acts, even to non-parties \nto the administrative proceedings. See Skinner & \n\n33 \n \n \nEddy Corp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557, 562-65 \n(1919) (construing the Urgent Deficiencies Act and \nholding that in situations where the ICC exceeded its \nstatutory powers, \u201cthe courts have jurisdiction of suits \nto enjoin the enforcement of an order, even if the \nplaintiff has not attempted to secure redress in a \nproceeding before the commission\u201d); see also Interstate \nCom. Comm\u2019n v. Diffenbaugh, 222 U.S. 42, 49 (1911) \n(stating that, though the issue of jurisdiction was not \nraised by the parties, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs are affected by \nthe order, and it is just that they should have a chance \nto be heard, although not parties before the \nCommission\u201d).  \nThere is a direct link between this Court\u2019s ICC \nprecedent (described above) and the ultra vires \nexception used by the Fifth Circuit. See, e.g., Am. \nTrucking, 673 F.2d at 85 n.4 (citing, inter alia, \nSkinner, 249 U.S. at 563-64). The reasoning of those \nICC cases, in which this Court determined that \naffected parties should have redress when an agency \nexceeds its powers, is especially relevant here. The \nability to obtain review when an agency exceeds its \nauthority should not be dependent on the state\u2019s \nstatus as a party to the administrative proceeding, \nespecially where, as described in detail above, the \nability for a state to intervene in NRC licensing \nproceedings is all but impossible, and the NRC actions \nhave such potentially catastrophic consequences.  \nIn short, if the Court declines to hold that Texas is \na \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act, then it \nshould uphold the Fifth Circuit\u2019s determination that, \nin proceedings before NRC, the ultra vires exception \nis warranted for a state to obtain judicial review.  \n\n34 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court of Appeals judgment should be affirmed.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nRA\u00daL TORREZ \n   Attorney General of New Mexico  \nALETHEIA V.P.

PLF is the most expe-\nrienced public-interest legal organization defending \nthe constitutional principle of separation of powers in \nthe arena of administrative law. \nPLF currently represents a client whose access to \njudicial review would be denied under the govern-\nment\u2019s self-serving interpretation of the Hobbs Act.  \nSee theDove Media, Inc. v. Fed. Commc\u2019n Comm\u2019n, No. \n24-60407 (5th Cir.).  More broadly, PLF is interested \nin preventing agencies from manipulating adminis-\ntrative procedures to evade judicial scrutiny.  See, e.g., \nSackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120 (2012) (denying agency\u2019s \nuse of pre-enforcement compliance orders to escape re-\nview). \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reads \nthe Hobbs Act to limit judicial review to those who for-\nmally participated in the underlying licensing pro-\nceeding.  Yet this access comes only with the NRC\u2019s \npermission and, indeed, the agency closely regulates \nthird-party intervention into its adjudications.  If the \n \n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, amicus curiae states \nthat no counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and that no entity or person, aside from amicus curiae, its \nmembers, and its counsel, made any monetary contribution \ntoward the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n \n2 \n \ngovernment\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act is ac-\ncepted, then \u201cthe NRC controls the courthouse door \nthrough its authority to determine who may be \u2018par-\nties\u2019 to licensing proceedings.\u201d Texas v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 95 F.4th 935, 936 (5th Cir. 2024) (Jones, J., \nconcurring in denial of en banc rehearing).  \nAmicus shows how the NRC, in practice, exercises \nsignificant discretionary authority over entry to its in-\nhouse tribunals and, by extension, the availability of \njudicial review under the Hobbs Act.  Regardless of \nwhether it amounts to an intentional strategy, the \nNRC is suppressing judicial review of purely legal \nquestions that speak directly to its own power.  \nAmicus urges this Court to reject the government\u2019s \nself-serving construction of the Hobbs Act and instead \naffirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding of the stat-\nute\u2019s \u201cplain text.\u201d See Texas v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 78 F.4th 827, 838 (5th Cir. 2023) (\u201c[T]he \nplain text of the Hobbs Act requires only that a peti-\ntioner have participated\u2014in some way\u2014in the agency \nproceedings, which Texas did through comments and \nFasken did by seeking intervention and filing conten-\ntions.\u201d).  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe \nNRC \nControls \nAccess \nto \nIts \nAdjudications and, by Extension, the \nAvailability of Judicial Review for Purely \nLegal Questions \nIn every NRC licensing proceeding, the applicant is \nthe central party, and the agency\u2019s staff also has a \nright to formally participate.  See 10 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 2.1202(b). For the rest of the public, however, there \nis no intervention of right. See BPI v. Atomic Energy \nComm\u2019n, 502 F.2d 424, 428 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (finding \n\n \n3 \n \nthat the Atomic Energy Act \u201cdoes not confer the auto-\nmatic right of intervention\u201d).  Instead, the operative \nstatute requires admission for any person \u201cwhose in-\nterest may be affected.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a).  The \nNRC interprets the phrase, \u201cwhose interest may be af-\nfected,\u201d as an implicit delegation of authority to deny \nintervention to those with insufficient \u201cinterest\u201d in the \nproceeding.  See BPI v. Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 502 \nF.2d at 429 (sustaining the agency\u2019s implied authority \nto \u201cnarro[w] those within the larger class to those en-\ntitled to participate as intervenors\u201d).  On this equivo-\ncal legal basis, the NRC closely regulates public access \nto its adjudications.  \nPractically speaking, the NRC controls access to its \nproceedings with heightened pleading requirements. \nSee 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309.  These pleading standards were \ndeveloped by the NRC through multiple amendments \nto its rules of practice, resulting in today\u2019s robust re-\ngime for restricting public access to NRC proceedings.  \nSee 33 Fed. Reg. 8,588 (June 12, 1968) (enhancing \nspecificity requirements); 37 Fed. Reg. 15,132 (July \n28, 1972) (adding criteria by which the NRC could \ndeny intervention); 54 Fed. Reg. 33,168 (Aug. 11, \n1989) (adding materiality and broadening specificity \nrequirements); 72 Fed. Reg. 49,474 (Aug. 28, 2007) \n(enhancing specificity requirements); see also Union of \nConcerned Scientists v. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 920 \nF.2d 50 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (upholding 1989 amend-\nments).  These standards \u201c[are] strict by design.\u201d  See \nIn re Dominion Nuclear Conn., Inc. (Millstone Nuclear \nPower Station, Units 2 & 3), 54 N.R.C. 349, 358 (2001).  \nAccording to one scholar, \u201cthe central thrust\u201d of the \nNRC\u2019s pleading rules \u201c[is] to make intervention and \nparticipation in the Commission\u2019s licensing proceed-\nings more difficult.\u201d  Richard Goldsmith, Regulatory \n\n \n4 \n \nReform and the Revival of Nuclear Power, 20 Hofstra \nL. Rev. 159, 191 (1991).  \nThis heightened pleading standard imposes two \nburdens.  The first is a requirement that a petitioner \nfor intervention establish administrative standing. \nSee 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309(d).  The agency\u2019s rules do not \nspecify a standard to guide the assessment of admin-\nistrative standing. Instead, the NRC has developed its \nown body of standing law, though the agency looks to \n\u201ccontemporaneous judicial concepts\u201d for guidance.  See \nIn re Fla. Power & Light Co. (Turkey Point Nuclear \nGenerating Plant, Units 3 & 4), 82 N.R.C. 389, 394 \n(2015).  Pursuant to this in-house doctrine, a peti-\ntioner can establish administrative standing based on \neither judicial concepts or a geographic presumption \nfor those living within 50 miles of the nuclear power \nplant in question.  See In re Interim Storage Partners \nLLC (WCS Consol. Interim Storage Facility), 90 \nN.R.C. 31, 47-48 (Aug. 23, 2019) (explaining agency\u2019s \nstanding analysis).  But a petitioner who establishes \neither or both circumstances is not ensured interven-\ntion.  Ultimately, the decision rests with the agency, \nwhich can deny administrative standing for a person \nwho would otherwise meet the requirements for Arti-\ncle III standing.  See Envirocare of Utah, Inc. v. Nu-\nclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 194 F.3d 72, 75 (D.C. Cir. 1999) \n(\u201cThe [NRC] . . . is not an Article III court and thus is \nnot bound to follow the law of standing.\u201d) \nIn addition to demonstrating administrative stand-\ning to the NRC\u2019s satisfaction, the petitioner must also \nsubmit at least one viable \u201ccontention\u201d that sets forth \nan issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.  See \n10 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.309(f).  A contention must satisfy six cri-\nteria, including that it is \u201cmaterial,\u201d falls within the \nproceeding\u2019s \u201cscope,\u201d and demonstrates a \u201cgenuine \n\n \n5 \n \ndispute.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2.309(f)(1)(i)-(vii).  Under the NRC\u2019s \nrules, failure to satisfy even one of the requirements \nrequires the NRC to reject the contention.  See Entergy \nNuclear Operations, Inc. (Indian Point, Unit 2), 83 \nN.R.C. 131, 136 (2016).  Of course, each of these \nthreshold limits is subject to interpretation, resulting \nin copious discretion for the NRC to deny petitions to \nintervene. See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm\u2019n, 823 F.3d 641, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cIf \na party\u2019s contentions do not meet the Commission\u2019s \nspecificity or relevancy requirements, the agency may \ndeny the hearing request.\u201d).  \nThe agency\u2019s pleading standards have no analogue \nin any other agency covered by the Hobbs Act.  See \nDean Hansell, Nuclear Regulatory Commission Pro-\nceedings:  A Guide for Intervenors, 3 UCLA J. of Env\u2019t \nL. and Pol\u2019y 23, n.56 (1982) (\u201cNo other federal regula-\ntory agency has a contention requirement[.]\u201d).  The \nSurface Transportation Board, for example, requires \nonly that a petition to intervene sets out \u201cpetitioner\u2019s \ninterest,\u201d its \u201crequest . . . for relief,\u201d and a statement \nsupporting or opposing the underlying action.  See 49 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1112.4. \nIn the licensing proceeding below, the agency\u2019s \npleading standards proved insurmountable.  The \nNRC\u2019s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board denied in-\ntervenor status to most (7 of 11) petitioners (or joint \npetitioners) based on administrative standing.  See In \nre Interim Storage Partners, 90 N.R.C. at 50-51.  The \nNRC declined to hear these standing questions on ap-\npeal, because the agency ultimately affirmed the \nBoard\u2019s denial of all remaining contentions. See In re \nInterim Storage Partners LLC (WCS Consol. Interim \nStorage Facility), 92 N.R.C. 463, 478-79 (Dec. 17, \n\n \n6 \n \n2020).  These rejected contentions included purely le-\ngal arguments that mirror the statutory claims now \nbefore this Court, See id. at 467-68 (denying conten-\ntion that the license violates the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct).  In this manner, the NRC denied all third-party \nparticipation.  \nAlthough courts may review the NRC\u2019s decisions \ndenying intervention, this review provides no real con-\nstraint on the agency\u2019s control over public access to its \nadjudications. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239.  In these cases, \nthe only question before a court is whether the NRC \nabused its discretion in denying intervention, which \nentails a highly deferential standard of review.  See 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council v. \nU.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 823 F.3d at 655 (affirm-\ning NRC\u2019s \u201creasonable determination\u201d to deny inter-\nvention); Blue Ridge Env\u2019t Def. League v. Nuclear \nRegul. Comm\u2019n, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (2013) (holding that \nthe NRC \u201cacted reasonably in denying Petitioners\u2019 \ncontentions\u201d).  \nHere, the underlying proceeding perfectly illus-\ntrates the limitations of judicial review as a check on \nthe agency\u2019s control over access to its adjudications.  \nAfter the NRC denied all petitions to intervene, sev-\neral petitioners sought review in the D.C. Circuit, \nwhich consolidated the challenges.  Framing the ques-\ntion as \u201cwhether the [NRC] reasonably applied its \nhearing regulations,\u201d the D.C. Circuit sustained the \nagency in a cursory and unpublished opinion.  See \nDon\u2019t Waste Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, No. \n21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *2-*3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, \n2023).  Given the evident permissiveness of abuse-of-\ndiscretion review in this context, it follows that the \nNRC wields effective control over public participation \nbefore its tribunals\u2014and, therefore, control over who \n\n \n7 \n \nmay later obtain judicial review of the agency\u2019s sub-\nstantive decisions. \nIn sum, the government argues that \u201conly a \u2018party\u2019 \nto the agency proceeding may seek judicial review of \nCommission orders\u201d under the Hobbs Act, Pet. Br. at \n19, yet the NRC controls access to its proceedings.  \nThe NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act, when com-\nbined with its discretionary authority over adminis-\ntrative intervention, leaves the agency with signifi-\ncant discretion to shield its adjudicative orders from \njudicial review.  \nII.  The NRC Prevents Percolation of Purely \nLegal Questions Regarding the Agency\u2019s \nPurported Power \nThese concerns are not merely hypothetical.  Irre-\nspective of its actual intentions, the NRC is precluding \ncourts from scrutinizing purely legal questions re-\ngarding its purported statutory authority.   \nAn example will elucidate this point. Since the Nu-\nclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) changed the course of \nnational policy on the storage of spent nuclear fuel, \nthe NRC has issued three licenses like the one at issue \nin this case, involving the private storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel at new sites located away from the reactor.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. 30,801 (May 12, 2023) (granting li-\ncense to Holtec International to operate in New Mex-\nico); 86 Fed. Reg. 51,926 (Sept. 17, 2021) (granting li-\ncense to Interim Storage Partners, LLC to operate in \nTexas); 67 Fed. Reg. 18,253 (Apr. 15, 2002) (granting \nlicense to Private Fuel Storage L.L.C. to operate in \nUtah); see also Texas v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, \n78 F.4th 827, 832-33 (5th Cir. 2023) (explaining \nNWPA).  In the first proceeding, more than two dec-\nades ago, the NRC agreed to hear a contention that \n\n \n8 \n \nthe NWPA conflicted with the agency\u2019s asserted au-\nthority.  See Priv. Fuel Storage L.L.C., 55 N.R.C. 260, \n264-65 (Apr. 3, 2002).  Although the NRC ultimately \ngranted the license, the adversely affected party still \nhad recourse to meaningful judicial review on this \nNWPA question.  See Bullcreek v. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, 359 F.3d 536, 542-43 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  \nHowever, in the two more recent proceedings, in-\ncluding the one underlying this case, the NRC refused \nto hear this same purely legal \u201ccontention\u201d that the \nNWPA conflicts with the agency\u2019s purported author-\nity.  See In re Holtec Int\u2019l (HI-STORE Consol. Interim \nStorage Facility), 91 N.R.C. 167, 173-76 (Apr. 23, \n2020); In re Interim Storage Partners, 90 N.R.C. at 56-\n59.  In both instances, the D.C. Circuit upheld the \nNRC\u2019s denial of intervention in a deferential opinion \nthat failed to seriously address the challengers\u2019 statu-\ntory arguments.  See Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. U.S. Nu-\nclear Regul. Comm\u2019n, 113 F. 4th 956 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(upholding denial of intervention in Holtec proceed-\ning); Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. \nComm\u2019n, No. 21-1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *2-*3 (D.C. \nCir. Jan. 25, 2023) (affirming denial in Interim Stor-\nage Partners proceeding).  After the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed the agency\u2019s denials of intervention, the NWPA \nissue was removed from the jurisdiction of all courts \nthat accept the NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act.  \nBy regulating access to its proceedings, the NRC thus \nsuppressed lower court percolation of this serious stat-\nutory question regarding its own authority. \nUnder the NRC\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act, \nthe agency can regulate the availability of judicial re-\nview for its licensing decisions, as discussed above.  \nHowever, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Hobbs Act \n\u201cmay vary depending on the type of agency proceeding \n\n \n9 \n \ninvolved.\u201d See Pet Br. at 28.  For informal rules, it is \ncomparatively easier to become a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nunder the Hobbs Act; it is \u201cenough\u201d to submit a com-\nment. See ibid.  The NRC, therefore, wields far less \ncontrol over judicial review of its rulemakings than it \ndoes for its adjudications.  This dichotomy encourages \nthe agency to employ adjudicative procedures, even \nwhere an inclusive rulemaking clearly is more appro-\npriate.  C.f. Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947) (\u201c[T]he choice made between \nproceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc lit-\nigation is one that lies primarily in the informed dis-\ncretion of the administrative agency.\u201d).  \nIt is fair to wonder if this perverse incentive is at \nwork at the NRC.  After the failure of the Yucca Moun-\ntain repository roiled national policy, good governance \nprinciples seemingly would call for the NRC to exer-\ncise its generic rulemaking authority to update its \nstorage regulations, which are 45 years old.  See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(p) (rulemaking authority); 45 Fed. Reg. \n74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980) (promulgating current storage \nrules). A participatory process would seem especially \nwarranted, given the obvious nationwide implica-\ntions. Yet instead of conducting a rulemaking, the \nNRC has formulated its post-Yucca storage policy \nthrough two case-by-case licensing proceedings, in-\ncluding the one at issue in this controversy.  While the \nNRC\u2019s preference for adjudications makes little sense \nfrom a good governance perspective, it makes perfect \nsense from a public choice perspective.  By funneling \nits policymaking into adjudications, the agency can \nshield its post-Yucca policy from judicial scrutiny, in-\ncluding the purely legal determinations that under-\nwrite this policy. \n\n \n10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding \non justiciability under the Hobbs Act. \nRespectfully submitted, \nWILL YEATMAN \nPacific Legal Foundation \n3100 Clarendon Blvd., \n  Suite 1000 \nArlington, VA 22201 \n \nOLIVER J.

The United States requests the following division \nof argument time:  20 minutes for the federal petitioners,1 10 \n \n1 \nThe federal parties are the United States Nuclear Regu-\nlatory Commission and the United States.  They are the petitioners \nin No. 23-1300. \n\n2 \n \nminutes for the private petitioner, Interim Storage Partners \n(ISP),2 and 30 minutes for respondents.3  We respectfully request \nthat the federal petitioners be allowed to open the argument and \nto present rebuttal.  Counsel for ISP has agreed to this motion.   \n \nThese consolidated cases arise out of petitions for court of \nappeals review filed by respondents, alleging that the United \nStates Nuclear Regulatory Commission exceeded its statutory au-\nthority by granting a license that would permit ISP to store spent \nnuclear fuel away from the site of a nuclear reactor.  Pet. App. \n9a.  ISP intervened on the side of the federal petitioners \u201cto \nrepresent its interest[]\u201d in its license.  Ibid.  The court held \nthat respondents had permissibly petitioned for review under an \nultra vires exception to the requirement in the Hobbs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. 2341 et seq., that only \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d may seek \njudicial review of agency action, 28 U.S.C. 2344.  Pet. App. 18a-\n20a.  The court also held that the Commission lacks statutory \nauthority to license offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel.  Id. \nat 21a-30a.  The court vacated the license that the Commission had \ngranted to ISP.  Id. at 30a. \n \n2  \nISP is the petitioner in No. 23-1312. \n3  \nRespondents are the State of Texas; Greg Abbott, Gover-\nnor of the State of Texas; the Texas Commission on Environmental \nQuality; Fasken Land and Minerals, Limited; and Permian Basin Land \nand Royalty Owners.  They are respondents in both of the consoli-\ndated cases. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe federal petitioners and ISP filed separate petitions for \na writ of certiorari seeking review of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision.  The questions before the Court are:  (1) whether the Hobbs \nAct, which authorizes a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by an agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \norder\u201d to petition for review in a court of appeals, 28 U.S.C. \n2344, allows nonparties to obtain review of claims asserting that \nan agency order exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority; and (2) \nwhether the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., and \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq., \npermit the Commission to license private entities to temporarily \nstore spent nuclear fuel away from the nuclear reactor sites where \nthe spent fuel was generated. \n \nDividing the argument time for petitioners between the fed-\neral petitioners and ISP would be of material assistance to this \nCourt.  The federal petitioners have a substantial interest in \nthese cases because they were named respondents in the court of \nappeals; because they have a significant interest in the correct \ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement, \nwhich provides the basis for review of actions taken by numerous \nagencies; and because they have important interests in protecting \nthe Commission\u2019s statutory authority to issue licenses under the \nAtomic Energy Act and the Policy Act.  ISP also has a substantial \ninterest in these cases because it intervened as a respondent in \n\n4 \n \nthe court of appeals and because the court vacated ISP\u2019s license \nto store spent nuclear fuel.   \n \nWe accordingly request that the Court grant the motion for \ndivided argument. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \n \n ELIZABETH B.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  Respondents \nhave no substantive response, but instead just com-\nplain that such a critique is \u201chyperbole.\u201d  Fasken Br. \n47; Texas Br. 23.  It\u2019s not\u2014it is spot on. \nFinally with regard to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra \nvires doctrine, respondents give short shrift to the du-\nbious origins of that doctrine even in the Fifth Circuit \nitself, as well as to the compelling weight of uniform \ncontrary authority.  See ISP Br. 20-22; NRC Br. 23-25. \nThose factors and authorities further confirm that the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s stated basis for hearing the petitions of \nTexas and Fasken was error. \nIII. The Atomic Energy Act Authorizes the NRC \nto License the Temporary Storage of Spent \nNuclear Fuel Away from a Reactor Site \nA. The Atomic Energy Act\u2019s provisions re-\ngarding the constituent radioactive ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel authorize the \nNRC to regulate spent nuclear fuel. \nIn its decision, the Fifth Circuit accepted the oft-\nrecited (and accurate) proposition that \u201c[s]pecial nu-\nclear material, source material, and byproduct mate-\nrial are constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,\u201d \nand then proceeded to base its statutory analysis upon \nAEA provisions addressing those constituent materi-\nals.  ISP App. 22a (citing Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 F.3d \n536, 538 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Respondents, however, \n\n11 \nhave decided to take a different tack: their AEA argu-\nments now are largely based on the fact that the term \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d was not separately defined in the \noriginal AEA, but was instead added in 1988 as part of \nan unrelated overhaul of the Price Anderson Act.  \nFasken Br. 24 (\u201cIndeed, Congress did not amend the \nAEA to add \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 as a defined term until \n1988.\u201d (citing Price Anderson Amendments Act \u00a7 4(b), \n102 Stat. 1069)); Texas Br. 25-26.5\nRespondents\u2019 arguments run headlong into Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & \nDev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983).  That case was all \nabout \u201cspent fuel,\u201d id. at 194, and, more particularly, \nthe metes and bounds of how much Congress had oc-\ncupied the field regarding the storage of spent fuel in \nthe AEA, for preemption purposes.  The Court based \nits decision on its analysis of the then-current version \nof the AEA, including the provisions regarding the con-\nstituent elements of spent fuel.  Id. at 207.  The Court \nalso highlighted that \u201cthe NRC has promulgated de-\ntailed regulations governing storage and disposal \naway from the reactor.\u201d  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 217 \n5 Fasken makes much of the fact that a subsequent regu-\nlatory definition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d includes \u201cother radioac-\ntive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d Fasken Br. 26-27 \n(emphasis omitted) (citing Final Rule, Licensing Requirements \nfor the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Stor-\nage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,700-01 (Nov. 12, 1980); \n10 C.F.R. 72.3).  That reference merely recognizes the existence \nof control rod elements and the like\u2014the packaging that holds a \nnuclear fuel assembly together\u2014which become irradiated with \nuse.  See, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 961.11, Appendix E, Section B.2.  More-\nover, materials \u201cmade radioactive by exposure to the radiation in-\ncident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d are, in fact, \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(1). \n\n12 \n(citing 10 C.F.R. Part 72).  The addition of a separate \ndefinition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d on which respond-\nents now place such heavy reliance, had not yet oc-\ncurred\u2014that was still some five years into the future.  \nAnd the recently enacted Nuclear Waste Policy Act did \nnot affect the preemption analysis.  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. \nat 219.   \nWhile the Court ultimately held that the chal-\nlenged state statute addressed economic matters re-\nserved to the states and was therefore not preempted, \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning offered definitive guidance on \nthe scope of the AEA.  The Court made clear that Con-\ngress had \u201coccupied the entire field of nuclear safety \nconcerns,\u201d and the NRC, given the already-existing \nstatutory and regulatory landscape under the AEA, \nhad exercised its authority \u201cto authorize the storage of \nspent fuel.\u201d  461 U.S. at 212, 218.  Indeed, a key prem-\nise of the Court\u2019s holding was that although the federal \ngovernment was responsible to develop and license \ntechnology for \u201cnuclear waste disposal,\u201d the state stat-\nute had not attempted \u201cto enter this field  * * *  occu-\npied by the federal government.\u201d  Id. at 219.  The main \narguments propounded by respondents regarding the \nAEA in this case, therefore, cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas.6\n6 Texas posits an analogy about erroneously concluding \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration can regulate water, be-\ncause it can regulate hydrogen-fueled planes with oxygen equip-\nment.  Texas Br. 38.  That misses the mark.  The more apt anal-\nogy would be one section of a statute criminalizing the possession \nof heroin, and another the possession of cocaine.  No one could \nseriously argue that merely mixing the two drugs together takes \none completely outside of the law.  Yet, that is the essential posi-\ntion of respondents here. \n\n13 \nB. Respondents are unable to proffer any \nplausible interpretation of statutory text \nto support what they say the law is. \nRespondents\u2019 definitional arguments reveal an-\nother fundamental flaw in their efforts to defend the \nresult of the Fifth Circuit: there is no sensible inter-\npretation of the statutes that leads to what respond-\nents contend the law to be.  Texas asserts that the \nNRC \u201ccannot license possession of spent nuclear fuel at \nall.\u201d  Texas Br. 40.  Similarly, Fasken asserts that \u201c[n]o \nAEA provision grants NRC express authority to issue \na license for storing spent fuel.\u201d  Fasken Br. 24.  But, \nat the same time, Texas admits that \u201cno one disputes \nthat storage facilities onsite are permissible; they \nmust be.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  Well, what statutory provi-\nsion provides that \u201cpermission\u201d?  Respondents do not \nsay. \nThe necessary flipside of respondents\u2019 arguments \nalso reveals their error.  If, as respondents contend, \nthe provisions of the AEA addressing the constituent \ncomponents do not authorize the NRC to issue a li-\ncense for the possession and storage of \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d then the AEA also cannot prohibit the possession \nand storage of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014you cannot have \none without the other.7  We would be in a state of na-\nture: the unavoidable implication of respondents\u2019 ar-\nguments is that ISP did not even need a license from \nthe NRC, and could have just constructed the facility \non its own.  It is hard to imagine a scenario more inim-\nical to what Congress expressly identified as the core \n7 The prohibitions upon possession without a license are \nat 42 U.S.C. 2077(a) (special nuclear material), 2092 (source ma-\nterial) and 2111(a) (byproduct material). \n\n14 \npurposes of the AEA.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), (b); \n2012(a); 2013(d).  The statute should be interpreted in \na manner that harmonizes those provisions, not cre-\nates such elemental conflicts.  E.g., Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts (\u201cReading Law\u201d) 181-182 (2012). \nC. Respondents\u2019 ejusdem generis-type inter-\npretations of the AEA are erroneous. \nNeither respondent tries to defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretive analysis of the AEA.  The court be-\nlow held that the only permissible licenses with re-\nspect to special nuclear and source material were for \n\u201ccertain types of research and development,\u201d ISP App. \n22a, based upon 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(1) and (2) and \n2093(a)(1) and (2).  The Fifth Circuit inexplicably \nfailed to account for subsection (a)(3) of both statutory \nsections, and failed to give any meaning to subsection \n(a)(4).  And with regard to byproduct material, the \nFifth Circuit misconstrued an inapplicable provision \n(42 U.S.C. 2111(b)) based upon internet-derived con-\nclusions involving not byproduct, but special nuclear, \nmaterial.  ISP App. 23a; see ISP Br. 37. \nRespondents, however, do try to construct post-hoc\nejusdem generis-type defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s re-\nsult, at least with respect to special nuclear and source \nmaterial. Fasken Br. 29-31; Texas Br. 26-28, 40-43.  \nThose efforts fail.   \nFirst, respondents cannot identify a supportable \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d that fits their needs.  That, alone, \nprecludes the ejusdem generis-type arguments of re-\nspondents.  E.g., Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. \n214, 225 (2008); Reading Law 209 (\u201c\u2018the enumeration \nof the specific items is so heterogeneous as to disclose \n\n15 \nno common genus.\u2019 With this type of wording, the \ncanon does not apply.\u201d (quoting Lord Macmillan, Law \nand Other Things 166 (1938)).  The specifically enu-\nmerated potential uses here include research and de-\nvelopment related to atomic energy ((2073(a)(1), \n2093(a)(1)), research or development related to medi-\ncal therapy or medical therapy itself ((2073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2)), and for \u201cuse in a license\u201d for certain isotope \nproduction facilities, and in nuclear power plants.  42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3).  Respondents have come \nup with an argued common attribute of \u201cproductive \nuse,\u201d which they say excludes temporary storage of the \nmaterials, even at reactor sites.  Fasken Br. 30; Texas \nBr. 28.  That, however, is a made-up restriction with-\nout any textual, historical, or other support, and is fur-\nther belied by the admission that \u201csome form of tem-\nporary, onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel inheres in \nthe use of nuclear fuel.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  If there is any \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d here (and ISP does not agree that \nthere is), the fact that the enumerated items include \nnuclear power plants would mean that regulation of \nradioactive materials that \u201cinhere\u201d to operation of \nsuch plants would fit comfortably within any reasona-\nble postulated commonality. \nSecond, whether or not one labels Sections \n2073(a)(4) and 2093(a)(4) as \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions, \nthose terms indisputably have to be given some mean-\ning.  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 596, 607-608 (2010); \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  Respondents\u2019 con-\nstructs fail to do so, and the better interpretation is to \nconclude that the provisions encompass the licensing \nof temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel at away-\nfrom-reactors sites.   \n\n16 \nIt is also important to give meaning to what Con-\ngress actually said about the duties of the NRC, which \nis that it was required to \u201cestablish by rule, regulation, \nor order, such standards and instructions to govern the \npossession and use of special nuclear material, source \nmaterial, and byproduct material, as the Commission \nmay deem necessary or desirable to promote the com-\nmon defense and security or to protect health or to \nminimize danger to life or property,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), consistent with the \u201cdevelopment, use, and \ncontrol of atomic energy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a),8 and \nwithout any locational limitation.  The restrictive con-\ntentions of respondents are irreconcilable with Con-\ngress\u2019s clear commands. \nIn short, respondents cannot defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s construction of the AEA, nor reconcile their ar-\nguments with Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 217, nor defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from Bullcreek, 359 F.3d \nat 541, and Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. \nNielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. 2004).  See \nalso, Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 964 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Which is perhaps why they have, \nnow, pivoted to relying primarily upon the NWPA for \ntheir merits-based arguments. \n8 These provisions are not, as Texas claims, mere empty \n\u201cpolicy statements\u201d that can be ignored for these purposes. Texas \nBr. 37-38, 41 (citing Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U.S. 28 (2019)).  Ra-\nther, they are commands and delegations that do not conflict or \noverride any operative language from the statute and quite inten-\ntionally leave the agency with flexibility to regulate.  This Court \nhas recognized that such provisions should be applied as written.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 & n.6 (2024).   \n\n17 \nIV. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not For-\nbid the NRC from Licensing Private Parties\u2019 \nTemporary Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nAway from a Reactor Site. \nRespondents \nfundamentally \nmisconstrue \nthe \nNWPA.  They erroneously contend that it is the \nNWPA, rather than the AEA, that must provide the \n\u201cstatutory authority to license ISP\u2019s private, offsite \nstorage.\u201d  Fasken Br. 17; Texas Br. 29-31.  That is just \nnot so.  E.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121 (NWPA \n\u201cgoverns the establishment of a federal repository for \npermanent storage [i.e., disposal], not temporary stor-\nage by private parties.\u201d).  It is true enough that peti-\ntioners \u201cdo not contend the NWPA authorizes ISP\u2019s li-\ncense\u201d (Fasken Br. 20), but that is because no one ever \nthought that the NWPA was enacted to do so.  And it \nwasn\u2019t, as confirmed by the text, structure, and legis-\nlative history of that law. \nRegarding the text: the Fifth Circuit held that the \nNWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the ISP license, ISP App. 30a, \nbut cited no statutory provision that says that.  Nor do \nrespondents.  There is none.  Fasken contends that 42 \nU.S.C. 10155(h) \u201cspecifically forbids\u201d private offsite \nstorage facilities (Fasken Br. 19), but that provision \ndoes not \u201cforbid\u201d anything at all.9  Rather, the provi-\nsion says \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d\u2014meaning the \nNWPA\u2014\u201cshall be construed to * * * authorize\u201d private \n9 42 U.S.C. 10155(h): \u201cApplication * * * Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, nothing in this chapter shall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or Federal \nuse, purchase, lease or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian power nuclear reactor \nand not owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d \n\n18 \nstorage facilities.  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  In \nother words, the provision limits the scope of the \nNWPA.  But the NWPA is not, and never has been, the \nsource of the NRC\u2019s licensing authority at issue here.  \nRespondents\u2019 position cannot be squared with the stat-\nute\u2019s words\u2014it would make no sense for Congress to \nsay that the law did nothing to \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cre-\nquire\u201d an activity if (as respondents argue) that activ-\nity was already altogether banned.  Respondents can \npoint to no statutory text whatsoever to support their \nmain substantive position. \nRegarding the structure: The overall purpose of the \nNWPA was to establish the federal government\u2019s re-\nsponsibilities for the permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Subpart A set forth a plan for a permanent \nrepository.  42 U.S.C. 10131-10145.  Subpart B deals \nwith an interim storage program by the federal govern-\nment, pending permanent disposal.  42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157.  That was a limited program, designed to help \nutilities manage spent nuclear fuel while waiting for a \npermanent disposal site, and\u2014significantly\u2014it ex-\npired by its terms in 1990.  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).  That \nis, there were a number of conditions and processes as-\nsociated with the program, including a requirement \nthat any utility desiring to participate execute a con-\ntract with the federal government \u201cno later than Jan-\nuary 1, 1990.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).   \nRespondents chiefly rely upon provisions within \nthat Subpart B.  Texas Br. 29-31; Fasken Br. 18 (citing \n42 U.S.C. 10152, 10153, 10154).  Importantly, how-\never, all of those provisions concerned the limited fed-\neral interim storage program in Subpart B, and there-\nfore can be properly understood only as \u201cpreconditions \n\n19 \non private generators for obtaining federal interim \nstorage.\u201d  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  It is plainly \nwrong for respondents to argue that those now-expired\nportions of Subpart B are, instead, the only potential \nsource of the NRC\u2019s current authority to license a pri-\nvate party\u2019s possession of spent nuclear fuel at all, an-\nywhere.  E.g., Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 299 (9th \nCir. 1991) (\u201cThe Act\u2019s restrictive language [in Subpart \nB] limits the requirements to the specific set of reme-\ndial storage agreements authorized by the Act itself.\u201d). \nRegarding the legislative history:  First, and im-\nportantly, the legislative history conclusively confirms \nthat Congress was fully aware that the AEA had been \ninterpreted and applied by the NRC to authorize off-\nsite storage of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  \nE.g., S. Rep. No. 97-282, at 44 (1981); see Bullcreek, \n359 F.3d at 542; In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, \nCLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, 400 (Dec. 18, 2002) (\u201cMem-\nbers of Congress clearly were well aware that \u2018other \nprovisions of law\u2019 authorized private [away-from-reac-\ntor] storage facilities, as the existence, and fate, of \nsuch facilities was discussed in congressional commit-\ntee debates.\u201d), & n.35, n.44, n.45 (citations omitted).10\nCongress, of course, is presumed to know the state of \nthe law when it enacts legislation, e.g., Edelman v. \nLynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 117-118 (2002), and \nhere that knowledge is unquestionable.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that the meaning of the AEA should be in-\nformed by the subsequent NWPA (Texas Br. 28) is fair \n10 In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, 56 N.R.C. at 399-\n410, cites and summarizes the voluminous relevant legislative \nhistory in a far more comprehensive manner than space will allow \nfor here. \n\n20 \nenough as a general proposition, but that proposition \ncuts squarely against respondents in this case.   \nSecond, with regard to the federal interim storage \nprogram invoked by respondents, the legislative his-\ntory reveals efforts to balance competing concerns \nabout the nature and scope of such a program. See \nS. Rep. No. 97-282 (1981); H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, pt. 1 \n(1982); 128 Cong. Rec. 28,032 (1982).  Sec-\ntion 10155(h), on which respondents heavily rely, went \nthrough drafts and debates which confirm that its ul-\ntimate role was to ensure that DOE would not take \nover private facilities to fulfill its NWPA responsibili-\nties, and that also make clear that utilities would not \nhave to exhaust potential off-site storage options to \ngain access to the federal interim storage program at \nSubpart B (which had been a requirement in some \nearly drafts).11  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 543.  Signif-\nicantly, however, \u201c[n]othing in those reports and de-\nbates suggests that Congress intended to prohibit pri-\nvate use of private away-from-reactor facilities.\u201d  Ibid.\nAlthough they avoided or disavowed it below,12 it \nis apparent that respondents\u2019 real argument is that \n11 See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, at 20 (1982), reprinted \nin part in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3792 (H.R. 3809, \u00a7 133(b)(1)(D)), re-\nported out of the House Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs on \nApril 27, 1982; Nuclear Waste Disposal Policy: Hearing Before the \nSubcomm. on Energy Conservation and Power of the House \nComm. on Energy and Commerce on H.R. 1993, H.R. 2881, H.R. \n3809, and H.R. 5016, 97th Cong. 2-3 (1982) (reference to \u201ctenta-\ntive agreement\u201d requiring generators to exhaust private offsite \nstorage as options in order to access federal interim storage). \n12 21-60743 State Pets.

Texas Br. 28, 43; Fasken Br. 21-23.  \nRespondents have not come close to clearing that high \nhurdle in this case.  E.g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 549 (1974).  The preexisting NRC authority under \nthe AEA to license private parties to store spent nu-\nclear fuel away from existing reactor sites was not \nmerely \u201cimplied,\u201d as Fasken argues.  Fasken Br. 22 \n(citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988)).  Rather, that AEA authority was demonstra-\nbly and indisputably known to Congress when it \npassed the NWPA, and formally enshrined in the Code \nof Federal Regulations after extensive notice-and com-\nment processes (which Texas contends \u201cprompted \nalarm,\u201d Texas Br. 3).  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542-\n543.  And, as explained above, there is no conflict \nwhatsoever, much less any \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d \n(Fasken Br. 22 (citation omitted)) between the AEA \nand NWPA with regard to the NRC\u2019s authority to li-\ncense private parties to temporarily possess spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Respondents\u2019 case for repeal by implication \nfalls woefully short. \nFinally, both respondents invoke West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  Fasken Br. 32-33; Texas Br. \n31, 35.

That \nwould mean an extension of 40 days in No. 23-1300 and an extension of 37 days in \nNo. 23-1312.  The certiorari petition in No. 23-1300 was filed and docketed on June \n12, 2024; the certiorari petition in No. 23-1312 was filed on June 12, 2024, and it \nwas docketed on June 14, 2024.  Without the requested extensions, the brief in \nresponse for each case would be due on July 12 and July 15, respectively.     \n \nThe requested extensions to file a response to the certiorari petitions are \nnecessary to allow undersigned counsel time to review each of the multiple petitions \nand to prepare a joint response.  Also, if the extensions are applied to all respondents \nin both cases, that will result in both cases being set on the same briefing track.  \nFurther, the requested extensions will not delay the Court\u2019s consideration of the \npetitions, which would take place at the conference the week of September 30, 2024, \nwith or without the requested extensions. \n \nCounsel for the Texas state entities (respondents in both Nos. 23-1300 and \n23-1312) join in this request for extensions.   \n\n \n \n \nHon.

Box 2910 \nAustin, Texas 78768 \n \nDear Governor Dewhurst and Speaker Straus: \nEnclosed is a report completed at my request by the \nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  \nThis report evaluates the challenges posed by spent nu-\nclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste (to-\ngether \u201cHLW\u201d) currently stored on-site at the six Texas \nnuclear reactors. \nIn light of recent developments regarding the interim \nstorage and disposal of HLW by the federal govern-\nment, Texas now faces the very real possibility that it \n\n2 \n \nwill have to find a solution to the long-term issue of safe \nand secure handling of this waste.  The citizens of Texas \n\u2014and every other state currently storing radioactive \nwaste\u2014have been betrayed by their federal govern-\nment after contributing billions of dollars to fund a fed-\neral solution for HLW disposal, because a federal solu-\ntion still does not exist. \nSince the U.S. Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act in 1982, each state, including Texas, has been \nassured that the federal government would take posses-\nsion and provide a disposal solution for any HLW gen-\nerated within its borders.  In 1987, the federal govern-\nment identified Yucca Mountain in Nevada as being the \nultimate disposal option with a completion date in 1998.  \nAfter extensive litigation, delays and cost overruns, in \n2009 President Obama abandoned any further develop-\nment of Yucca Mountain and Congress ceased all fund-\ning in 2011 after more than $15 billion had been spent \ncharacterizing and developing the site. \nEarly in 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy an-\nnounced that it was developing a new plan to replace \nYucca Mountain\u2014estimating that an HLW disposal so-\nlution would not be available until 2048.  However, in \nNovember 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia determined that the federal govern-\nment has \u201cno credible plan\u201d to dispose of HLW. \n2048, or whatever year Washington forecasts that a so-\nlution will be provided, is too long to wait. \nI believe it is time for Texas to act, particularly since \nNew Mexico is seeking to be federally designated for \nHLW disposal.  The New Mexico proposed site is ap-\nproximately 50 miles from the Texas border, and we \nmust ensure our citizens are protected.  We have no \n\n3 \n \nchoice but to begin looking for a safe and secure solution \nfor HLW in Texas\u2014a solution that would allow the cit-\nizens of Texas to recoup some of the more than $700 mil-\nlion they have paid toward addressing this issue. \nI hope the enclosed report will be sent to the appropri-\nate oversight committees in your chamber.  The leader-\nship at TCEQ understands the importance of this issue, \nand I believe they will be a valued resource as we con-\ntinue to develop a Texas solution for the long-term res-\nolution of HLW currently residing inside our borders. \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n/s/  \nRICK PERRY \nRICK PERRY  \n \n \nGovernor \nRP:mmp \nEnclosure \n \n \n\n4 \n \nTexas Commission on Environmental  \nQuality Program Report for the September 19, 2014 \nTRAB Meeting \nLow-level radioactive waste disposal:  On August 28, \nTCEQ issued Amendment No. 26 to RML R04100 as a \nmajor amendment.  The amendment 1) revised the per-\nformance assessment, 2) adjusted the amount of finan-\ncial assurance required, and 3) increased the licensed \nvolume of the compact disposal facility.  Waste Control \nSpecialists is now authorized under the license to accept \nall Class A, B, and C low-level radioactive waste for dis-\nposal, including depleted uranium in concentrations \ngreater than 10 nanocuries/gram. \nUranium Mining: \nMajor amendments for license area expansion at two in \nsitu uranium mining licenses were declared technically \ncomplete in July and August.  Public notice was pub-\nlished in the Falfurrias Facts on August 7, 2014 for the \nMeste\u00f1a Alta Mesa Project, with the comment period \nending on September 8, 2014.  Public notice for the \nSouth Texas Mining Venture Palangana Project will be \npublished soon.  A major amendment application from \nSignal Equities for a license area expansion on their \nBrown Project and a new license application from UEC \nfor their Burke Hollow project are both currently under \ntechnical review. \nTCEQ had begun working towards obtaining partial re-\nlease from the NRC of a portion of the former licensed \narea of the abandoned IEC Lamprecht/Zamzow site.  \nOn August 12, 2014, a team of 14 TCEQ field workers \nalong with 3 individuals from DSHS began gamma sur-\nveys and soil sampling in support of an effort to release \n\n5 \n \nnon-operational areas for unrestricted use.  Using GPS \ndata units coupled to survey meters, 2-man teams col-\nlected data across 775 acres in a portion of the formerly \nlicensed area.  Two more field days are currently \nplanned to finish data collection.  When all data have \nbeen collected and analyzed, a Completion Review Re-\nport will be written and submitted to the NRC for their \nconcurrence in a partial release of these areas for unre-\nstricted use.  TCEQ has also initiated its contracting \nprocess to be able to contract for the clean-up of the op-\nerational portion of this site. \nBy-product material disposal:  Operation of the byprod-\nuct waste disposal facility continues under its current \nlicense.  By license condition, the byproduct disposal op-\neration is limited to receiving only the Fernald byprod-\nuct waste.  Staff members continue to review WCS\u2019s en-\nvironmental monitoring reports and related data. \nUnderground Injection Control:  TCEQ is processing \ntwo applications for new Class III UIC permits for in \nsitu uranium mining and one application for expansion \nof the permit area of an existing in situ uranium mining \nsite.  One of the new applications (UEC Burke Hollow \nsite) is for an unmined site in Bee County.  The other \nnew application (Signal Equities Brown site) is for a \npreviously-mined site (USX Boots-Brown) in Live Oak \nCounty.  The application for expansion (STMV Palan-\ngana site) is in Duval County. \n \n \n\n6 \n \nIN THE COMMISSIONERS COURT  \nOF \nANDREWS COUNTY, TEXAS \nA resolution in support of establishing a site in  \nAndrews County for consolidated interim storage of \nspent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. \nWHEREAS, Andrews County, Texas, as host to two low-\nlevel radioactive waste disposal facilities operated \nby Waste Control Specialists LLC (\u201cWCS\u201d), greatly \nbenefits directly and indirectly from the economic \nactivity associated with disposal of radioactive ma-\nterials; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County recognizes the importance \nof a diversified economy to the livelihood of the citi-\nzens of Andrews County; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County is home to a specialized \nworkforce with expertise concerning radioactive ma-\nterials, and WCS currently employs more than 170 \nfull-time employees with an annual payroll of more \nthan $13 million in Andrews County; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County has invested in the suc-\ncess of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facil-\nities operated by WCS by issuing $75 million in \nbonds and using that revenue to purchase property \nleased by WCS as part of the operation of the dis-\nposal facilities; and \nWHEREAS, Andrews County receives five percent of \nthe gross receipts from waste disposed of at the two \nlow-level radioactive waste disposal facilities, which \nreceipts to date have totaled over $5 million directly \npaid to Andrews County and are expected to total \nmore than $3 million per year in the future; and \n\n7 \n \nWHEREAS, WCS has consistently shown its commit-\nment to the environment and the citizens of Andrews \nCounty by, among other things, designing and oper-\nating safe, state-of-the-art radioactive materials fa-\ncilities, working to ensure that Andrews County \nshares in economic benefits because of WCS opera-\ntions, and working to ensure that local stakeholders \nare kept informed and made an integral part of the \ndecision-making process concerning WCS opera-\ntions; and \nWHEREAS, there are substantial quantities of Spent \nNuclear Fuel (\u201cSNF\u201d) and High- Level Radioactive \nWaste (\u201cHLW\u201d) currently stored at sites through-\nout Texas and the United States; and \nWHEREAS, much of the SNF and HLW is currently \nstored at sites that are vulnerable to natural disas-\nters and located near large metropolitan centers; \nand \nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy \n(the \u201cDOE\u201d) concluded in 2013 that a geologic repos-\nitory for the permanent disposal of SNF and HLW \nwill not be available until 2048, at the earliest; and \nWHEREAS, the federal Blue Ribbon Commission on \nAmerica\u2019s Nuclear Future in 2012 recommended \n\u201cprompt\u201d efforts to develop one or more consoli-\ndated SNF and HLW interim storage facilities while \nfurther efforts are made to develop a permanent dis-\nposal site; and \nWHEREAS, the Texas Commission on Environmental \nQuality (\u201cTCEQ\u201d) analyzed the challenges associ-\nated with creating a consolidated SNF and HLW in-\nterim storage solution in Texas in its March 2014 As-\n\n8 \n \nsessment of Texas\u2019s High Level Radioactive Waste \nStorage Options report (the \u201cReport\u201d); and \nWHEREAS, the TCEQ, in the Report, noted that con-\nsolidated SNF and HLW interim storage in Texas \nwould offer electricity consumers significant savings \ncompared to storage at each nuclear power plant and \nthat the siting and construction of a consolidated \nSNF and HLW interim storage facility is \u201cnot only \nfeasible but could be highly successful\u201d so long as \nthe approach \u201cminimizes local and state opposition \nthrough stakeholder meetings, finding volunteer \ncommunities, financial incentives, and a process that \nis considered fair and technically rigorous;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the Texas Radiation Advisory Board issued \nan official statement of its position \u201cthat it is in the \nstate\u2019s best interest to request that Texas be consid-\nered by the Federal Government as a consolidated \nSNF storage site;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the Governor of Texas noted that Texas \nshould \u201cbegin looking for a safe and secure solution \nfor HLW in Texas;\u201d and \nWHEREAS, the workforce, the geography, and the ge-\nology of Andrews County make it an ideal location \nfor safe storage of radioactive materials, and An-\ndrews County is a volunteer community that wishes \nto offer its unique resources to help solve the state\u2019s \nand country\u2019s SNF and HLW storage problems. \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AND OR-\nDERED that the Commissioners Court of Andrews \nCounty, Texas, meeting in open session, believes \nthat the construction and operation of a consolidated \nSNF and HLW interim storage facility in Andrews \n\n9 \n \nCounty (the \u201cFacility\u201d), licensed by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and developed by WCS, will \nenhance the health, safety, and welfare of the citi-\nzens of Andrews County; and \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED AND ORDERED that the \nCommissioners Court of Andrews County does \nhereby declare and express the commitment of An-\ndrews County to explore the development of the Fa-\ncility, and in support thereof does hereby call upon \nand ask: \nthe State of Texas, all its agencies, officials and \npolitical subdivisions, and all members of the \nTexas congressional delegation to work coopera-\ntively with all relevant entities towards the crea-\ntion of the Facility, including taking actions to ev-\nidence approval of the development of the Facil-\nity, such as executing and delivering letters of \nsupport, cooperative agreements, or other docu-\nments needed in connection with the site selec-\ntion, siting and licensing of the Facility; and \nthe State of Texas, all its agencies and officials, \nand all members of the Texas congressional dele-\ngation to assist Andrews County in securing all \nfederal incentives that may be available, as a re-\nsult of siting the Facility, from the DOE or an-\nother appropriate federal entity;

The license application fo-\ncuses primarily on receiving SNF from the existing per-\n\n13 \n \nmanently shutdown and/or decommissioned commercial \nreactors across the U.S.  WCS believes that this ap-\nproach will allow for the safe consolidated interim stor-\nage of SNF in a community that has expressed its will-\ningness to host such a facility consistent with the rec-\nommendations from President Barack Obama\u2019s Blue \nRibbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future, until \nsuch time that a permanent geologic repository is li-\ncensed, constructed, and able to serve the nation\u2019s need \nas envisioned under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n1982. \nThe purpose and objective of licensing the CISF in An-\ndrews County, Texas, is to allow the removal of SNF \nand the return of decommissioned reactor sites to a \ngreen field status.  These lands may be subsequently \nrepurposed in ways that economically benefit the com-\nmunities that had been willing to host commercial nu-\nclear reactors needed to generate electricity.  A con-\nservative and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis con-\ncluded that this is an economically efficient solution that \ncould reduce the expenditure of the Federal Govern-\nment by hundreds of millions of dollars compared to the \n\u201cno action\u201d alternative.  Additionally, by allowing the \nfederal government to meet its obligations to take spent \nnuclear fuel, this approach could also allow the burden \nto shift to the ratepayers, who have already paid into \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund, and save taxpayers over 5.4 \nbillion dollars.  Finally, there could be a benefit of over \n1 billion dollars to the local communities that are cur-\nrently hosting or that will in the future host de facto \u201cin-\nterim storage facilities\u201d at  \n \n \n\n14 \n \nCorporate \n5430 LBJ Freeway, Ste. \n1700 \nThree Lincoln Centre \nDallas, TX 75240 \nPh. 972.715.9800 \nFx. 972.448.1419 \nFacility \nP.O. Box 1129 \nAndrews, TX 79714 \nPh. 888.789-2783 \nFx. 432 525-8909 \nEnclosures transmitted herein contain SUNSI.  \nWhen separated from enclosures, this transmittal \ndocument is decontrolled. \ndecommissioning reactor sites, in that they would be \nable to more constructively repurpose land being used \nfor no other function than to store \u201cstranded\u201d fuel. \nAs specified in the license application, WCS anticipates \nthat the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) would take \ntitle to the SNF and transport it from existing storage \nsites across the U.S. to the CISF. \nWCS has prepared the license application consistent \nwith the requirements specified in Title 10 of the Code \nof Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 72, Licensing Re-\nquirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel, High-Level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor- \nRelated Greater Than Class C Waste. WCS also relied \non information provided in Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.50, \nStandard Format and Content for a Specific License \nApplication for an Independent Spent Fuel Storage In-\nstallation or Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility, \nto prepare the license. \nThe specific license application contains the following: \n\u2022  A Safety Analysis Report (SAR) which contains \nthe information specified in 10 CFR 72.24, Con-\ntents of application:  Technical information.  It \n\n15 \n \nwas prepared following the information provided \nin RG-3.48, Standard Format and Content for the \nSafety Analysis Report for an Independent Spent \nFuel Storage Installation or Monitored Retriev-\nable Storage Installation (Dry Storage).  Infor-\nmation provided in NUREG-1567, Standard Re-\nview Plan for Spent Fuel Dry Storage Facilities, \nwas also used to prepare the SAR. \n\u2022  A Quality Assurance Program Description is pro-\nvided in Chapter 6 and Appendix C to the license \napplication pursuant to 10 CFR 72.24(n) and \n72.140(d). \n\u2022  The Physical Security Plan, including the guard \ntraining, and a Safeguard Contingency Plan, are \nprovided pursuant to 10 CFR 72.24(o), 72.180, \nand 72.184, respectively, separately as part of \nthis license application because it contains Safe-\nguards Information. \n\u2022  Proposed Technical Specifications are provided \nin Appendix A of the license application pursuant \nto the requirements specified in 10 CFR 72.26. \n\u2022  A description of WCS\u2019 technical qualifications is \nprovided in Chapters 2 of the license application \npursuant to 10 CFR 72.28. \n\u2022  WCS\u2019 proposed training program is similarly de-\nscribed in Chapter 7 of the license application as \nrequired under 10 CFR 72.28(b) and \u00a7 72, Sub-\npart I. \n\u2022  A proposed decommissioning plan and decommis-\nsioning funding plan is provided in Chapter 10,  \nas well as Appendices B and D of license applica-\ntion.  A decommissioning cost estimate support-\n\n16 \n \ning the license application was prepared follow-\ning NUREG-1757, Consolidated Decommission-\ning Guidance. \n\u2022  WCS\u2019 Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is in-\ncluded as part of this application pursuant to 10 \nCFR 72.32.  This plan was prepared to include the \nlocation and hazards associated with storing SNF \nat the CISF following RG 3.67, Standard Format \nand Content for Emergency Plans for Fuel Cycle \nand Materials Facilities, and other guidance \nspecified in the ERP. \n\u2022  An Environmental Report was prepared to as-\nsess the radiological and non-radiological impacts \nassociated with storing up to 40,000 MTU of SNF \nfor a period of 40 years following NUREG-1748, \nEnvironmental Review Guidance for Licensing \nActions Associated with NMSS Programs.  WCS \nensured that the cumulative environmental im-\npacts associated with storing SNF at the CISF \nwere evaluated in a manner that avoids segmen-\ntation of the requirements specified in the Na-\ntional Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  WCS \nalso incorporated by reference Environment Im-\npact Statements previously conducted by the \nNRC related to the transportation and storage of \nSNF, as well as at the National Enrichment Fa-\ncility located on property adjacent to the CISF. \n\u2022  Proposed license conditions are provided in \nChapter 13 of the license application pursuant to \n10 CFR 72.44. \nWCS hereby files its license application with the NRC. \nBoth proprietary and non-proprietary versions of the li-\ncense application and supporting documents are pro-\n\n17 \n \nvided herein accompanied by the enclosed affidavits \npursuant to 10 CFR 2.390. \nWCS requests that a copy of all correspondence regard-\ning this matter be directly emailed to my attention \n(skirk@valhi.net) as soon as possible after issuance.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nWashington, DC 20555-0001 \nRE:  Docket ID NRC-2016-0231 \nDear Ms. Bladey: \nTexas Parks and Wildlife Department \n(TPWD) received the request for review \non the scope of the U.S. Nuclear Regu-\nlatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) Environ-\nmental Impact Statement (EIS) for \nWaste Control Specialists, LLC (WCS) \nlicense application to store up to 5,000 \nmetric tons of uranium (MTU) for a pe-\nriod of 40 years in a consolidated interim \nstorage facility (CISF) to be located at \nthe WCS site in Andrews County, Texas. \nTPWD staff has reviewed the infor-\nmation provided and offers the following \ncomments and recommendations con-\ncerning this project. \nProject Description \nWCS has prepared a CISF license appli-\ncation for approval by the NRC.  If the \nrequested license is issued, WCS anticipates subse-\nquently requesting an amendment to the license for au-\nthorization to possess and store an additional 5,000 \nMTUs of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) for each of the ex-\npansion phases to be completed over the course of twenty \nyears.  WCS anticipates that 40,000 MTUs of SNF \n\n42 \n \nwould be stored at the CISF upon completion of all \neight phases. \nWCS currently operates a commercial waste manage-\nment facility on approximately 1,338 acres of land.  The \nCISF would be located north of the existing WCS radi-\noactive waste storage, processing, and disposal facili-\nties.  The facility would be built in eight phases, with \none phase being completed approximately every 2.5 \nyears. Initial construction of phase one would encom-\npass approximately 155 acres.  Each phase would in-\ncrease the overall footprint incrementally until the final \nfootprint reaches approximately 320 acres with the \ncompletion of phase eight.  Because the site is currently \nundeveloped, potential land use impacts would primar-\nily be from site preparation and construction activities.  \nApproximately 12 acres would be used for contractor \nparking and lay down areas during facility construction.  \nThe total disturbed area would be approximately 332 \nacres including the contractor parking and lay down \narea.  The contractor lay down and parking area would \nbe restored after completion of the facility construction. \nWCS has prepared an environmental report to evaluate \nthe radiological and non-radiological impacts associated \nwith construction and operation of the CISF for SNF \nand Reactor-Related Greater than Class C Low-Level \nRadioactive Waste. \nFederal Laws \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act \nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) prohibits taking, \nattempting to take, capturing, killing, selling/purchasing, \npossessing, transporting, and importing of migratory \nbirds, their eggs, parts and nests, except when specifi-\n\n43 \n \ncally authorized by the Department of the Interior.  This \nprotection applies to most native bird species, including \nground nesting species.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-\nvice (USFWS) Migratory Bird Office can be contacted \nat (505) 248-7882 for more information on potential im-\npacts to migratory birds. \nSection 3.5.3.3 of the environmental report states \n\u201cBirds were surveyed through observation and by call \nat the proposed CISF and its vicinity to document spe-\ncies, potential breeding species, seasonal migrants and \nwinter residents.\u201d \nRecommendation:  If migratory bird species are \nfound nesting on or adjacent to the project area, they \nmust be dealt with in a manner consistent with the \nMBTA.  TPWD recommends excluding vegetation \nclearing activities during the general bird nesting \nseason, March through August, to avoid adverse im-\npacts to this group.   If clearing vegetation during \nthe migratory bird nesting season is unavoidable, \nTPWD recommends surveying the area proposed for \ndisturbance to ensure that no nests with eggs or \nyoung will be disturbed by operations.   Any vegetation \n(trees, shrubs, and grasses) where occupied nests are \nlocated should not be disturbed until the eggs have \nhatched and the young have fledged. \nEndangered Species Act \nFederally-listed animal species and their habitat are \nprotected from \u201ctake\u201d on any property by the Endan-\ngered Species Act (ESA).  Take of a federally-listed spe-\ncies can be allowed if it is \u201cincidental\u201d to an otherwise \nlawful activity and must be permitted in accordance \nwith Section 7 or 10 of the ESA.  Any take of a federally \nlisted species or its habitat without the required take \n\n44 \n \npermit (or allowance) from the USFWS is a violation of \nthe ESA. \nLesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) \nSection 3.5.3.3 states \u201cThe USFWS currently lists the \nlesser prairie chicken as a threatened species.\u201d \nOn April 10, 2014, the USFWS published a final rule \nwhich listed the lesser prairie-chicken (LPC) as a \nthreatened species.  LPC Final Rule, 79 Fed. Reg. \n19,974 (Apr. 10, 2014).  By Order dated September 1, \n2015, U.S. District Judge Robert Junell vacated this \nrule.  See, Permian Basin Petroleum Association, et al. \nv. Department of the Interior, Cause No. 14-CV-00050, \nin the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nTexas, Midland Division.  The Order emphasizes the \nconservation efforts as set out in LPC Range-Wide \nConservation Plan (RWP). \nOn July 19, 2016 the USFWS fulfilled the court ruling \nthat had vacated the ESA listing decision by officially \nremoving the LPC from the Federal List of Endan-\ngered and Threatened Wildlife.  The USFWS is under-\ntaking a thorough re-evaluation of the LPC\u2019s status and \nthe threats the species faces using the best available sci-\nentific information to determine whether a new listing \nunder the ESA is warranted. \nRecommendation:  TPWD recommends the NRC and \nWCS monitor the listing status of the LPC.  Future \nchanges in listing status could require consultation, \npermitting, and mitigation with the USFWS. \nSection 3.5.3.3 of the environmental report states \u201cHis-\ntorically a WCS ranch manager reported seeing a fe-\nmale lesser prairie chicken near the CISF (Ortega, Bry-\n\n45 \n \nant, Petit, & Rylander, 1997) but the sighting was never \nverified.\u201d \nThe LPC Interstate Working Group developed the \nRWP which is a voluntary plan administered by the \nWestern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.  The \nCovered Area of the RWP includes public and private \nproperty that currently provides or could potentially \nprovide suitable habitat for the LPC within the current \nestimated occupied range of the LPC and 10 miles \naround that range (EOR+10).  The Covered Area is \nrepresented in the Southern Great Plains Crucial Hab-\nitat Assessment Tool (CHAT). \nAs seen on the attached map, the proposed project is \nwithin the EOR+10 in CHAT Category 3 (Modeled \nHabitat).  Therefore, this project is eligible for enroll-\nment in the RWP. \nRecommendation:  Enrollment is recommended for \nprojects that are within the EOR+10 or where the \nimpact buffer of a new project extends into the \nEOR+l0. Additional information including a link to \nthe RWP can be found at http://www.wafwa.org/ \ninitiatives/grasslands/lesser_prairie_chicken/ \nState Law \nParks and Wildlife Code, Section 68.015 \nSection 68.015 of the Parks and Wildlife Code regulates \nstate-listed species.  Please note that there is no provi-\nsion for the capture, trap, take, or kill (incidental or oth-\nerwise) of state-listed species.

At that time \nof year, they may be able to avoid slow (less than 15 \nmiles per hour) moving equipment.  The remainder of \nthe year, this species hibernates only a few inches un-\nderground and they will be much more susceptible to \nearth moving equipment and compaction. \nRecommendation:  TPWD recommends WCS avoid dis-\nturbing the Texas homed lizard and colonies of its pri-\nmary food source, the Harvester ant (Pogonomyr-\nmex sp.), during clearing and construction.  TPWD \nrecommends a permitted biological monitor be pre-\nsent during construction to try to relocate Texas \nhorned lizards if found.  If the presence of a biologi-\ncal monitor during construction is not feasible, Texas \nhorned lizards observed during construction should \nbe allowed to safely leave the site. \nA mixture of cover, food sources, and open ground is \nimportant to the Texas horned lizard and Harvester \nant.  Disturbed areas within suitable habitat for the \nTexas horned lizard should be revegetated with site-\n\n47 \n \nspecific native, patchy vegetation rather than sod-\nforming grasses. \nSpecies of Concern/Special Features \nIn addition to state and federally-protected species, \nTPWD tracks special features, natural communities, \nand rare species that are not listed as threatened or en-\ndangered.  TPWD actively promotes their conservation \nand considers it important to evaluate and, if necessary, \nminimize impacts to rare species and their habitat to re-\nduce the likelihood of endangerment and preclude the \nneed to list as threatened or endangered in the future.  \nThese species and communities are tracked in the Texas \nNatural Diversity Database (TXNDD). \nNo records of rare, threatened or endangered species \nhave been documented within 1.5 miles of the project \nsite in the TXNDD.  However, based on the project lo-\ncation the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus Acre-\nnicolus) (DSL) may be impacted from the proposed \nproject. \nSection 3.5.4 of the environmental report states \u201cThe \nsand dune lizard has been reported in the area north-\nwest of the proposed CISF in past site surveys.\u201d \nIn December 2010, the DSL, also known as the sand \ndune lizard, was proposed for federal listing under the \nESA.  Since that time, the USFWS has received new \ninformation regarding suitable and occupied habitat for \nthis species, and voluntary conservation measures (dis-\ncussed below) have been established.  Based on these \nefforts, on June 13, 2012, the USFWS determined the \nDSL is no longer in danger of extinction.  However, the \nUSFWS will closely monitor the conservation measures \nto ensure they are being implemented and effectively ad-\n\n48 \n \ndress identified threats.  The USFWS can then reevaluate \nwhether the DSL requires protection the ESA. \nA voluntary conservation program has been created to \nprotect suitable habitat for the DSL and minimize ad-\nverse impacts from development.  In February 2012, \nthe USFWS approved the Texas Conservation Plan for \nthe Dunes Sagebrush Lizard, which was developed in \nconsultation with the USFWS, the Texas Comptroller \nof Public Accounts, TPWD, and several other agencies. \nThis plan can be found at https://www.fws.gov/southwest/ \nes/Documents/R2ES/TX_Cons_Plan_DSL_20110927. \npdf.  The goal of the Texas Conservation Plan is to fa-\ncilitate continued economic activity in this region and to \npromote conservation of the DSL in compliance with the \nESA for covered activities. \nBased on the Texas Conservation Plan final map of the \npermit area (probability of suitable DSL habitat) the \nproject site includes an area that is High Likelihood of \nOccurrence for this species.  Potential adverse impacts \nto this species could include removal, fragmentation, \nand destabilization of shinnery oak habitat during con-\nstruction. \nRecommendation:  TPWD recommends WCS avoid \nadverse impacts to the DSL and suitable DSL habi-\ntat in implementing this project. \nTPWD also recommends implementation of the fol-\nlowing conservation measures within suitable DSL \nhabitat: \n\u2022  To minimize additional fragmentation of habitat, \nmaximize use of existing developed areas and \nroads \n\n49 \n \n\u2022  Within suitable DSL habitat confine construction \nto the period during which the DSL is inactive \n(i.e. October - March). \n\u2022  Minimize the footprint of the development within \nDSL habitat \n\u2022  Restrict vehicle traffic to the extent feasible \n\u2022  Avoid aerial sprayed application of approved \nherbicide for weed control \n\u2022  Avoid the introduction of non-native vegetation \n\u2022  Reclaim DSL habitat with appropriate native \nvegetation using locally-sourced native seeds and \nvegetation \n\u2022  During post construction, control mesquite and \nother invasive and problematic herbaceous and \nwoody species that would degrade or impair DSL \nhabitat \nPlease note that the absence of TXNDD information in \nan area does not imply that a species is absent from that \narea.  Given the small proportion of public versus pri-\nvate land in Texas, the TXNDD does not include a rep-\nresentative inventory of rare resources in the state.  \nAlthough it is based on the best data available to TPWD \nregarding rare species, the data from the TXNDD do \nnot provide a definitive statement as to the presence, \nabsence or condition of special species, natural commu-\nnities, or other significant features within your project \narea.  These data are not inclusive and cannot be used \nas presence/absence data.  This information cannot be \nsubstituted for on-the-ground surveys.  The TXNDD is \nupdated continuously.  As the project progresses and \nfor future projects, please request the most current and \n\n50 \n \naccurate \ninformation \nat \nTexasNatural.Diversity \nDatabase@tpwd.texas.gov. \nRecommendation:  TPWD recommends the NRC and \nWCS review the TPWD county list for Andrews \nCounty, as rare species in addition to those discussed \nabove could be present depending upon habitat avail-\nability.  These lists are available online at http:// \ntpwd.texas.gov/gis/rtest/.  If during construction, the \nproject area is found to contain rare species, natural \nplant communities, or special features, TPWD rec-\nommends that precautions be taken to avoid impacts \nto them.  The USFWS should be contacted for spe-\ncies occurrence data, guidance, permitting, survey \nprotocols, and mitigation for federally listed species.  \nFor the USFWS rare species lists by county please \nvisit http://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/. \nDetermining the actual presence of a species in a \ngiven area depends on many variables including daily \nand seasonal activity cycles, environmental activity \ncues, preferred habitat, transiency and population \ndensity (both wildlife and human).  The absence of a \nspecies can be demonstrated only with great diffi-\nculty and then only with repeated negative observa-\ntions, taking into account all the variable factors con-\ntributing to the lack of detectable presence.  If en-\ncountered during construction, measures should be \ntaken to avoid impacting wildlife. \nI appreciate the opportunity to provide preliminary in-\nput on potential impacts related to this project, and I \nlook forward to reviewing the EIS.

Phase 1 construction would begin after \nissuance of the license and after WCS successfully en-\nters into a contract for storage with the U.S. Depart-\nment of Energy (DOE).  Construction is estimated to \ntake approximately one year to complete.  Both con-\nstruction and preoperational testing are expected to be \ncomplete by December 2020.  WCS anticipates contin-\nued storage for approximately 60 years or until a final \ngeologic repository is licensed and operating in accord-\nance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of \n1982, as amended. \nHistory and Background \nSince 1997, WCS has been licensed and authorized to \ntreat, store, and dispose of certain types of radioactive \nmaterials at its facilities located in Andrews County, \nTexas.  WCS is authorized to dispose of Class A, B, and \nC LLRW at the Texas Compact Waste Disposal Facility \nand the Federal Waste Disposal Facility (TCEQ, \n2015a).  WCS is also authorized to dispose of 11e.(2) by-\nproduct materials at its Byproduct Material Disposal \nFacility (TCEQ, 2015b).  These activities are regulated \n\n56 \n \nby the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \n(TCEQ) under regulations determined to be compatible \nwith NRC requirements, pursuant to Section 274 of the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. \nThe U.S. Congress enacted the NWPA of 1982 charging \nthe DOE with developing a geologic repository for the \ndisposal of SNF generated by commercial nuclear \npower plants located throughout the U.S.   In 1987, Con-\ngress amended the NWPA to streamline and focus \nwaste management on developing the geologic reposi-\ntory at Yucca Mountain, located in Nye County, Ne-\nvada.  Pursuant to the NWPA, the DOE was responsible \nfor licensing Yucca Mountain with operations beginning \non January 31, 1998. \nOn July 23, 2002, President George W. Bush approved \nCongressional legislation designating Yucca Mountain \nas the final geologic repository intended for the disposal \nof commercial SNF and high level waste generated by \nthe federal government.  The DOE submitted a license \napplication to the NRC for authorization to construct \nand operate Yucca Mountain.  The NRC construction \nand operation of the ISFSI in February 2006, actions by \nthe Department of the Interior (regarding right-of-way \nfor rail access to the site) and the Bureau of Indian Af-\nfairs (regarding uncertainties over land trust issues) \nprecluded the facility from becoming operational (Fed-\neral Register, 2006). \nThe Private Fuel Storage facility was designed and li-\ncensed to store up to 40,000 MTUs of spent fuel in \nsealed metal casks (approximately 4,000 storage casks) \nfor a term of 20 years.  The environmental impacts for \nthese major licensing actions were thoroughly evalu-\nated and discussed in Final Environmental Impact \n\n57 \n \nStatement for the Construction and Operation of an In-\ndependent Spent Fuel Storage Installation on the Res-\nervation of the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indi-\nans and Related Transportation Facility in Tooele \nCounty, Utah, NUREG-1714, published in December \n2001 (NRC, 2001). \nThe NRC directed staff to develop a waste confidence \ndecision and promulgated the Continued Storage Rule \nsupported by an environmental impact statement \n(SRM-COMSECY-12-0016) (NRC, 2012).  As such, the \nNRC completed a Generic Environmental Impact \nStatement (GEIS) for Continued Storage of Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel (NUREG-2157) (NRC, 2014a) that ad-\ndressed the impacts attributable to continued storage \nof SNF.  The report was needed by the NRC to fulfill \nits responsibilities under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act (NEPA) (NRC, 2014a).  The environmental \nimpacts evaluated in NUREG-2157 include those re-\nlated to short-term (60 years), long-term (an additional \n100 years), and indefinite storage of SNF at existing \ncommercial nuclear power plants, as well as at an \n\u201caway-from-reactor\u201d storage facility. \nIn developing NUREG-2157, NRC referred to the pre-\nvious environmental analyses that supported issuance \nof the FEIS for the Private Fuel Storage facility in \nTooele, Utah.  The NRC concluded that implementation \nof the Preferred Alternative to issue a license to PFS \nauthorizing construction and operation of an ISFSI in \nTooele County, Utah would not result in significant ad-\nverse impacts to the environment. \n1.1 Purpose And Need For The Proposed Action \nThe DOE has not yet developed a permanent geologic \nrepository that would allow for the disposal of commer-\n\n58 \n \ncial SNF at Yucca Mountain in Nye County, Nevada, as \nrequired under the NWPA.  The DOE was required to \nopen the repository and begin accepting SNF for dis-\nposal at Yucca Mountain on January 31, 1998.  However, \nthe earliest estimated time by which a permanent geo-\nlogic repository could be licensed and operational is \n2048.

Fas-\nken conducts oil and gas operations on their own land \nand upon leases in Andrews and surrounding counties. \nThe PBLRO is a coalition of landowners, ranchers, roy-\nalty owners and oil and gas operators with interests in \nland, minerals and agriculture throughout the Permian \nBasin.  The PBLRO Coalition was in response the pro-\nposed situating of interim high-level nuclear waste fa-\ncilities within the Permian Basin. \n\u201cThe Permian Basin covers an area approximately 250 \nmiles wide and 300 miles long and is composed of more \n\n65 \n \nthan 7,000 fields.\u201d  (Texas Railroad Commission, 2018) \nFields are underground reservoirs of commercially val-\nuable oil or gas.  In the Permian Basin, production from \nthose fields emerges from depths ranging from a few \nhundred feet to five miles below the surface.  (Texas \nRailroad Commission, 2018) Recent increased use of \nenhanced-recovery practices in the Permian Basin has \nresulted in the Permian Basin becoming \u201cthe nation\u2019s \nmost prolific oil producing area and the largest crude oil \nproducing region in the United States.\u201d  (The US. En-\nergy Information Administration, 2018). \nFictitious Consent \nAndrews County is located within the Permian Basin \nand authorities likely selected this West Texas county \nas a site for high-level nuclear waste due to favorable \nconditions including the geographic characteristics, \nsparse population, with a large percentage being His-\npanic, and the lack of economic diversity.  Also a factor \nin the application is the applicant\u2019s misrepresenting \nconsent to the NRC based upon the Andrews County \nJudge and Commissioners\u2019 issuance of a resolution sup-\nporting the expansion of their low-level waste facility to \ninclude high-level waste.  That resolution, however, was \nenacted without citizen engagement or participation.  \nThe County\u2019s tactic of proceeding quietly was likely \npurposeful after contemplating the controversy and \nnarrow vote encountered when they proposed a low-\nlevel nuclear waste facility. \nWe oppose approval of the application for its failure to \neducate and inform Andrews County residents, to en-\ngage them in the process and for the lack of full disclo-\nsure.  There is no true consent and to say otherwise is \nfalse. \n\n66 \n \nNot only do we find the NRC\u2019s consent-based protocol \nto be flawed, but we also find the failure to obtain con-\nsent from neighboring communities to be defective.  \nThere has not been notice or opportunity for public par-\nticipation in neighboring communities that may be di-\nrectly or indirectly affected by the WCS license to store \nhigh-level nuclear waste.  Those most directly affected \nare the communities along the transportation corridor \nthrough which the waste will travel.  According to the \nWCS application, an estimated twenty thousand casks \nwill travel by rail through Midland, Texas, yet the city \nof Midland was completely unaware of WCS\u2019 proposal \nuntil October of 2018.  Upon being made aware of WCS\u2019 \napplication and transportation plan, the Midland City \nCouncil hosted a public hearing at which Elicia Sanchez, \nWCS Vice President, and Midland residents testified.  \nIt was indisputably fair and open to public participation \nand concluded with the passage of a resolution objecting \nto the transportation of high-level nuclear waste through \nMidland.  In addition, in the five weeks that have tran-\nspired since Midland residents first became aware of \nthe WCS application, over 1300 Midland residents have \nsigned a petition in opposition to the WCS license to \nstore high-level nuclear waste. \nSite Selection Puts American Energy at Risk and Fails \nto Present True Data \nWe oppose situating high-level nuclear waste in An-\ndrews County or anywhere within the Permian Basin \ndue to the inherent risks the waste poses to the region \nthat has placed Texas and the United States in the po-\nsition of being a global energy leader. \n \n\n67 \n \nAccording to Commissioner Ryan Sitton of the Texas \nRailroad Commission, the \u201cPermian Basin output has \npositioned America to be a global leader in energy pro-\nduction.  Oil and gas production in the Permian has \ngrown exponentially over the last few years, bringing \nwith it unprecedented job growth and revenue for the \nState of Texas.  It is dramatically improving America\u2019s \neconomic strength and national security.\u201d  (Texas Rail-\nroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton describing the Per-\nmian Basin, October 25, 2018) \nWe find fault in the WCS application\u2019s failure to accu-\nrately recognize Andrews County\u2019s importance to the \nnation\u2019s energy independence.  The application depicts \nAndrews County as simply an area with oil and gas ac-\ntivity.  WCS grossly understates the importance of what \nis transpiring in Andrews County and the Permian Ba-\nsin. \nAccording to the Texas Railroad Commission, which has \nprimary oversight over the State of Texas\u2019 oil and gas \nindustry, 338 drilling permits have been issued in An-\ndrews County in 2018.  The Commission reports that \nlast year, 37,543,497 bbl of oil and 65,584,676 mcf of gas \nwere produced in Andrews County. \nNot only does the application fail in its depiction of An-\ndrews County, but it also fails to account for the pro-\nspect of damage to the land and minerals in the area and \nthe County\u2019s budgetary losses if such damage were to \noccur.  WCS discusses its contribution to the Andrews \nCounty budget through a profit sharing plan, however, \nits application fails to acknowledge the much greater \nfiscal impact which the oil and gas industry has upon the \ncounty\u2019s budget.  Revenues to the County resulting \nfrom oil and gas production literally dwarf any impact \n\n68 \n \nthat might be seen from the proposed high-level nuclear \nwaste storage facility, yet they are put at risk with the \napproval of the WCS license. \nThe application also fails to provide an analysis or \nmethod by which land and minerals are valued for po-\ntential bonding or insurance.  It fails to provide data on \ncondemnation of land and minerals due to exposure or \ncontamination of high-level waste.  The applicant should \nbe required to present their methodology for specific \nrisks to land, minerals and agriculture as well as an ob-\njective analysis of impact upon those values should a \nleak or exposure occur. \nWe oppose the application and believe it should be de-\nnied for its failure to provide an accurate picture of the \noil and gas industry in Andrews County and the Per-\nmian Basin and for its failure to present an objective \nharms-benefit analysis. \nThe Application is Not Realistic \nWe oppose the issuance of a license to store high-level \nnuclear waste because the applicant is proceeding un-\nder the assumption that the storage site will be tempo-\nrary and that a permanent repository will be estab-\nlished.  There is no guarantee that a permanent reposi-\ntory will be established in the future.  For this reason, \nthere must be an element of the analysis that realisti-\ncally considers and accounts for the permanency of the \nproposed site and the implications of a storage facility \nthat will outlive all generations and, possibly, civiliza-\ntion.  The WCS application fails to account for the pos-\nsibility of permanency, which is a real possibility if the \nlicense is granted, thus the application is inadequate \nand fails. \n \n\n69 \n \nThe Analysis of Groundwater is Flawed \nWe oppose the WCS application due to the applicant\u2019s \nfailure to adequately address issues raised in a TCEQ \nmemo dated August 14, 2007 and drafted by technicians \nat the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality.  \nAfter nearly four years of studying the WCS site, the \ntechnicians determined that groundwater contamina-\ntion was possible.  TCEQ\u2019s executive director respond-\ned by dismissing the technicians\u2019 concerns and proceed-\ned to grant a license to WCS to store low-level waste.  \nThe following year, that same executive director left his \nposition at the TCEQ to work as a lobbyist for WCS.  \nWe find this suspect.  Dismissing the findings of the \ntechnicians was profoundly prejudiced and now, WCS\u2019 \nresponses to questioning are generalized and fail to dis-\nprove the findings of the technicians.  Evidence of ground-\nwater and concerns regarding the contamination of \ngroundwater rise to the level of warranting an unbiased \nand transparent study before a license to store high-\nlevel waste is issued. \nThe Application\u2019s Data is Speculative, and the Method is \nFlawed \nWe oppose the granting of a license that is based upon \nan application that is an exercise in self-study and self-\nassessment.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s ap-\nplication method is a flawed approach as it is logical to \nassume an applicant\u2019s lack of objectivity.  Compounding \nthat problem is the lack of data.  It is illogical to issue a \nlicense to store high-level nuclear waste when data re-\ngarding casks, emergency preparedness, risks and as-\nsumption of liability are unfinished, unavailable and \nnonexistent.  We have participated in public discussions \nhosted by the NRC and continue to be stonewalled when \nwe inquire as to missing elements of emergency prepar-\n\n70 \n \nedness, emergency response zones, cask testing and the \nlike.  It has been our firsthand experience in dealing \nwith the applicant and the NRC during public discus-\nsions that both have failed to explain the chain of re-\nsponsibility, both have failed to adequately address real \nharm risks, and both have failed to account for the in-\ncreased threat of high level waste by applying the ef-\nfects of low-level waste in their analysis.  For these in-\nadequacies, for the failure to account for realistic risks \nto health, safety, environment and economy, we oppose \nthe approval of the WCS application. \nOn behalf of Fasken Oil and Ranch, Ltd. and of the \nPBLRO, I appreciate your consideration of our con-\ncerns, as outlined in this letter and respectfully request \nthat the WCS application for a license to store high-\nlevel nuclear waste in Andrews County be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \nFasken Oil and Ranch, Ltd.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPBLRO \n \n \n \n /s/ \nTOMMY E.

This is something that now \nis\u2014could be said perhaps to be regular. \nWe think it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box that this licensing \nboard has opened.  In both of these cases, we now have \ncircumstances requiring local citizens to muster their \nresources, to challenge an application that is based on \nfuture changes to the law that may never happen.  Who \nknows how many more hypotheticals the industry may \ndream up out of their eagerness to get a business ad-\nvantage by becoming the first in line, so that their posi-\ntion to have the license in hand after the law\u2014just in \nthe law should change the way they want it to change? \nAllowing such hypothetical applications to be consid-\nered and approved is an incredible waste of the NRC\u2019s \nand the public\u2019s limited resources. \nJUDGE RYERSON:  Ms. Curran, if I can just stop \nyou there for a moment, I think where we may differ is \non your statement that this is an application based on \nchanges in the law. \nMS. CURRAN:  Uh-huh. \nJUDGE RYERSON:  I think one can fairly read the \nHoltec decision as saying\u2014at least I think this is what \nwe tried to say, is that when you look at [22] the record \nas developed in that adjudicatory proceeding, it is clear \nthat what the NRC is saying is that if a license is \ngranted, it would be a license to engage in lawful sales, \nand that might change in the future the scope of lawful \nsales. \nI suppose a state could have a 21-year-old drinking \nage and change it to 18.

We\u2019re \nnot saying it has to happen, and as far as I can tell, the \napplication does not purport, at least, to be dependent \non that.  But there\u2019s certainly a possibility that DOE\u2014 \nCongress could make DOE a lawful customer here. \nSo do you have a response to that view? \nMS. CURRAN:  Yes.  Well, I can\u2019t imagine that in, \nsay, a liquor licensing context, that the\u2014a county gov-\nernment would give a liquor license that  * * *  . \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n \n\n74 \n \nEnvironmental Impact Statement \nScoping Process \nSummary Report \nThe ISP CISF Environmental Impact \nStatement Public Scoping Period \nOctober 2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nRockville, Maryland \n \n \n\n75 \n \nA  \nThe ISP CISF Environmental Impact Statement \nPublic Scoping Period \nA.1 \nIntroduction \nIn April 2016, Waste Control Specialists LLC (WCS) \nsubmitted a license application to the U.S. Nuclear Reg-\nulatory Commission (NRC), including a Safety Analysis \nReport (SAR) and Environmental Report (ER), re-\nquesting authorization to construct and operate a Con-\nsolidated Interim Storage Facility (CISF) for spent nu-\nclear fuel (SNF) at WCS\u2019s existing hazardous and Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste (LLRW) storage and disposal \nsite in Andrews County, Texas.  The function of the \nCISF would be to store SNF and reactor-related Grea-\nter Than Class C (GTCC) LLRW generated at commer-\ncial nuclear power reactors.  The SNF and reactor- \nrelated GTCC LLRW would be transported from com-\nmercial reactor sites to the CISF by rail.  Although the \ninitial license request is to store 5,000 metric tons of \nuranium (MTU) at the CISF, WCS has stated its intent \nto submit future license amendment requests such that \nthe facility could eventually store up to 40,000 MTU. \nOn April 18, 2017, WCS requested that the NRC sus-\npend its licensing review.  On June 8, 2018, Interim \nStorage Partners, LLC (ISP), a joint venture of WCS \nand Orano CIS LLC (a subsidiary of Orano USA), re-\nquested that NRC resume the licensing process (ISP, \n2018a).  With this request, ISP submitted a revised li-\ncense application, later updated on July 19, 2018, to the \nNRC, which included a revised SAR (ISP, 2018b) and \nER (ISP, 2018c).  The revised application requests au-\nthorization to construct and operate a CISF for SNF \nand reactor-related GTCC radioactive waste (collec-\ntively referred to as SNF) as well as a small amount of \n\n76 \n \nmixed oxide fuel at the WCS site.  ISP prepared the re-\nvised license application in accordance with require-\nments in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 \nCFR), Part 72, \u201cLicensing Requirements for the Inde-\npendent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-Level \nRadioactive Waste, and Reactor-Related Greater than \nClass C Waste.\u201d \nThe NRC is preparing an environmental impact state-\nment (EIS) in accordance with Section 51.20(b)(9) of 10 \nCFR Part 51, \u201cEnvironmental Protection Regulations \nfor Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Func-\ntions,\u201d which implements the National Environmental \nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA).  The NRC published a no-\ntice of intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in the Federal \nRegister (FR) and began its scoping process on Novem-\nber 14, 2016 (81 FR 79531).  As part of its scoping and \nenvironmental review processes, the NRC staff re-\nquested public comments, attended a site visit of the \nproposed facility, held information gathering meetings \nwith local governments, and held public scoping meet-\nings in Hobbs, New Mexico; Andrews, Texas; and Rock-\nville, Maryland.  Additional information can be found in \nSection A.4 of this report. \nThe scoping meetings were designed to elicit input from \nthe public and government and private sector agencies \nand organizations on the scope of NRC\u2019s environmental \nreview for the proposed action.  The comments received \nhave helped the NRC staff determine the significant is-\nsues to be analyzed in detail in the EIS.  Details of these \nmeetings (i.e., slides, handouts, and transcripts) are \navailable on the NRC public web page for this project:  \nhttps://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/waste- \ncontrol-specialist.html.  Additionally, the comments re-\n\n77 \n \nceived are addressed in later sections of this scoping \nsummary report. \nThis scoping summary report summarizes comments \nand information the NRC gathered during the scoping \nprocess.  Section A provides a concise summary of the \nNRC\u2019s scoping process for the EIS, an overview of the \nissues that were raised (Section A.7), and a summary of \nthe NRC\u2019s determinations regarding the scope and con-\ntent of the EIS (Section A.8).  Section B contains sum-\nmaries of comments received during the public scoping \nperiod and the NRC\u2019s responses. \nThese responses contain conclusions on the scope of the \nEIS, including identification of any significant issues.  \nSection C contains an alphabetized table that identifies \nthe individuals that provided comments, their affiliation \nif provided, and the Agencywide Documents Access and \nManagement System (ADAMS) Accession number that \ncan be used to locate the correspondence.  Section D \nprovides references cited throughout the report.  AD-\nAMS is accessible from the NRC Web site at http:// \nwww.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html. \nA.2  \nBackground \nIn November 14, 2016, the NRC published a Federal \nRegister Notice (FRN) announcing NRC\u2019s intent to \nprepare an EIS, conduct scoping, and request public \ncomment (81 FR 79531).  With this FRN, the NRC \nopened the public scoping comment period for the EIS, \na period that closed on April 28, 2017 (82 FR 14039).  \nFollowing ISP\u2019s request that NRC resume the licensing \nprocess, the NRC issued an FRN on September 4, 2018, \nannouncing re-opening of the scoping period for an ad-\nditional 45 days (83 FR 44922), which was later ex-\ntended to close on November 19, 2019 (83 FR 53115).  \n\n78 \n \nThus, a total of 243 days was provided for the public to \nsubmit scoping comments to the NRC.  Given that NRC \nstaff guidance in NUREG\u20131748, \u201cEnvironmental Re-\nview Guidance for Licensing Actions Associated with \nNMSS Programs\u201d (NRC, 2003) recommends a mini-\nmum 45-day scoping comment period, the NRC deter-\nmined that 243 days constituted ample time for com-\nments to be prepared and submitted to the NRC. \nA.3  \nEnvironmental Impact Statement \nThe proposed action is the issuance to ISP, under the \nprovisions of 10 CFR Part 72, of an NRC license author-\nizing the construction and operation of the CISF at the \nWCS site in Andrews County, Texas.  The function of \nthe CISF would be to store SNF and reactor-related \nGTCC LLRW generated at commercial nuclear power \nreactors.  The SNF and reactor-related GTCC LLRW \nwould be transported from commercial reactor sites to \nthe CISF by rail.  During operation, the proposed CISF \nwould receive SNF from decommissioned reactor sites, \nas well as from operating reactors prior to decommis-\nsioning.  The CISF would serve as an interim storage \nfacility before a permanent geologic repository is avail-\nable.  Although the initial license request is to store \n5,000 MTUs at the CISF, ISP has stated its intent to \nsubmit future license amendment requests such that \nthe facility would eventually store up to 40,000 MTU.  \nISP\u2019s expansion of the proposed project (i.e., beyond an \ninitial phase) is not part of the proposed action cur-\nrently pending before the agency.  However, the NRC \nstaff will consider the expansion phases in its descrip-\ntion of the affected environment and impact determina-\ntions in the EIS, where appropriate, when the environ-\nmental impacts of the potential future expansion were \nable to be determined so as to conduct a bounding anal-\n\n79 \n \nysis for the proposed CISF project.  The NRC staff is \nconducting this analysis as a matter of discretion, be-\ncause ISP provided the analysis of the environmental \nimpacts of the future anticipated expansion of the pro-\nposed facility as part of its license application (ISP, \n2018a,b). \nISP envisions the CISF to be constructed in eight \nphases with each phase designed to store up to 5,000 \nMTU; therefore, ISP analyzed the environmental im-\npacts in the license application for storage of 40,000 \nMTU.  ISP, however, will be required to submit license \namendment requests to increase its storage capacity \nbeyond the initial 5,000 MTU phase.  The NRC would \nconduct safety and environmental reviews for any sub-\nsequent license amendment request to increase the fa-\ncility\u2019s storage capacity.  ISP is requesting a license for \na period of 40 years.  The license application relies on \nselected TN Americas and NAC International dry cask \nstorage systems, which would prioritize SNF stored at \nshutdown and/or decommissioned reactor sites.  Addi-\ntional storage systems and SNF currently located at op-\nerating reactor sites would be addressed via potential \nfuture license amendments.  Renewal of the license be-\nyond 40 years would require ISP to submit a license re-\nnewal request, which would be subject to separate \nsafety and environmental reviews [i.e., an Environmen-\ntal Assessment (EA) or EIS].  Therefore, the current \nEIS will evaluate the initial licensing period of 40 years.  \nBy the end of the license term of the proposed CISF (40 \nyears plus subsequent renewals, if approved), the NRC \nexpects that the SNF would be shipped to a permanent \ngeologic repository.  This expectation of repository \navailability is consistent with NUREG\u20132157, (NRC, \n2014), which concluded that a reasonable period of time \n\n80 \n \nfor the development of a repository is approximately 25 \nto 35 years (availability by 2048), based on experience \nin licensing similarly complex facilities in the United \nStates (U.S.) and national and international experience \nwith repositories already in progress. \nA separate safety review, conducted in parallel with the \nenvironmental review, will address the safety of SNF \nreceipt, transfer, and storage operations and related ac-\ntivities at the proposed CISF in Texas.  While the pro-\nposed action does not include or require a specific li-\ncense for transportation of radioactive material or ap-\nproval of specific transportation routes, the EIS will in-\nclude a discussion of the impacts of transportation for \nrepresentative shipments to and from the proposed fa-\ncility.  Transportation of SNF to the proposed CISF \nwould be primarily or entirely by rail. \nA.4  \nScoping Process \nOn November 14, 2016, the NRC staff opened the scop-\ning period and subsequently extended the scoping pe-\nriod until April 28, 2017.  During this period, the NRC \nstaff hosted four meetings to allow members of the pub-\nlic to provide oral scoping comments.  These meetings \nwere held in Hobbs, New Mexico on February 13, 2017; \nin Andrews, Texas on February 15, 2017; and at the \nNRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland (also via \nwebinar) on February 23 and April 6, 2017.  The NRC \nstaff\u200a\u2019s meeting slides, handouts, and project fact sheets \nwere available in both English and Spanish at the scop-\ning meetings, and these slides, handouts, and fact sheets, \nas well as the transcripts for each meeting, are available \nat NRC\u2019s public web page at https://www.nrc.gov/ \nwaste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/wcs/public-meetings.html.  \nOn September 4, 2018, the NRC staff reopened the \n\n81 \n \nscoping period for the ISP license application until No-\nvember 19, 2018.  Comments received during this re-\nopened scoping period were considered by the NRC, \nalong with all comments received during the previous \nperiod, in determining the scope of the EIS. \nWritten comments were accepted via the Federal rule-\nmaking website (www.regulations.gov) using Docket ID \nNRC\u20132016\u20130231, through email to WCS_CISF_EIS@ \nnrc.gov, fax, or regular U.S. mail.  The scoping process \nprovided an opportunity for members of the public to \nidentify issues and highlight concerns related to the \nproposed CISF.  The purpose of the scoping process (83 \nFR 44923) is to: \n\u2022 \nEnsure that important issues and concerns are \nidentified early and are properly studied \n\u2022  Identify alternatives to be examined \n\u2022  Identify significant issues to be analyzed in depth \n\u2022  Eliminate unimportant issues from detailed consid-\neration \n\u2022  Identify public concerns  * * *  \n*  *  *  * * \nNo-Action alternative and mitigation measures that will \nbe implemented to avoid or minimize adverse impacts. \nThe NRC has a longstanding practice of conducting its \nregulatory responsibilities in an open and transparent \nmanner to keep the public informed of the agency\u2019s reg-\nulatory, licensing, and oversight activities and to involve \nstakeholders in the regulatory process.  In part, it does \nso by making information available to the public through \nthe NRC\u2019s public Web site (www.nrc.gov) and its online \n\n82 \n \npublic document system (the Agencywide Documents \nAccess and Management System (ADAMS; accessible \nat https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html).  The \nNRC made WCS\u2019s application and ISP\u2019s revised appli-\ncation available to the public in ADAMS (docket num-\nber 72-1050) and on a project-specific website https:// \nwww.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/waste-control- \nspecialist.html.  The NRC also provided paper copies of \nWCS\u2019s application to public libraries in Andrews, \nTexas, in Hobbs, New Mexico, and in Eunice, New Mex-\nico. \nAs regards the NRC\u2019s hearing process and standing in \nthose proceedings, the NRC conducts hearings in ac-\ncordance with the Agency Rules of Practice and Proce-\ndure established in 10 CFR Part 2 of NRC\u2019s regula-\ntions.  The NRC\u2019s requirements for standing are pro-\nvided in 10 CFR 2.309. \nThe staff\u200a\u2019s Safety Evaluation Report will address the \nrequirements for storage of the spent nuclear fuel in the \nCISF.  For additional comments and responses con-\ncerning safety and storage, see Section B.26 [Com-\nments Concerning Safety]. \nComments:  (1-5-2) (1-7-7) (2-30-1) (3-9-5) (3-10-5) (3-\n26-2) (3-26-4) (3-33-2) (4-5-1) (5-2) (6-4) (35-2) (38-2) (38-\n7) (40-1) (40-10) (62-2) (105-2) (112-4) (118-6) (118-18) \n(139-24) (146-6) (149-7) (149-9) (160-2) (165-4) (165-31) \n(165-34) (169-4) (170-2) (178-2) (201-1) (220-3) (220-5) \n(225-4) (235-1) (239-1) (249-1) (261-2) (272-2) (275-1) \n(392-1) (401-1) (434-6) (447-2) (476-1) (511-19) (539-4) \n(551-2) (554-13) (556-3) (566-10) (605-1) (673-4) (695-3) \n \n \n\n83 \n \nB.1.2  NEPA Process\u2014Scoping Process \nThe NRC staff received comments about the scoping \nprocess for the proposed ISP CISF.  One commenter \nstated that scoping for the proposed CISF should in-\nclude consideration of unique and unprecedented mod-\neling for severe accident scenarios and cost-benefit mit-\nigation alternatives.  One commenter welcomed the \nscrutiny of the NRC and encouraged NRC to visit the \nsite whenever needed.  Another commenter looked for-\nward to the publication of responses to comments made \nat the scoping meetings.  Another commenter expected \ncomprehensive answers in the EIS to the issues raised \nduring the scoping process.  Finally, a commenter stated \nthat scoping should include a discussion of the respon-\nsibilities of the two national nuclear agencies to ensure \nthat interim storage of SNF is safe for the public now \nand in the future. \nResponse:  The NRC staff strives to conduct its regula-\ntory responsibilities, including the scoping process, in \nan open and transparent manner, consistent with the \nNRC Approach to Open Government (https://www.nrc. \ngov/public-involve/open.html).  The NRC requirements \nfor scoping are found at 10 CFR 51.26-51.29 and are fur-\nther explained in NUREG\u20131748, Section 4.2.3 (NRC, \n2003).  The objectives of the scoping process include:  (i) \ndefining the scope of the proposed action that is to be \nthe subject of the EIS, (ii) determining the scope of the \nEIS and identifying alternatives and significant issues \nto be analyzed in depth, and (iii) identifying and elimi-\nnating from detailed study issues that are peripheral or \nare not significant.  To this end, the NRC strives to give \nequal time to all participants in the scoping  * * *  . \n*  *  *  *  * \n\n84 \n \nB.1.6  NEPA Process\u2014Inadequate Information and/or \nAnalysis in the License Application \nThe NRC staff received comments that expressed con-\ncern that the license application has missing, mislead-\ning, inaccurate, and inadequate information and anal-\nyses.  Commenters stated that the ER contains inade-\nquate and incomplete information and analyses with re-\ngard to issues, resource areas, and required programs \nand plans including:  (i) transportation routes, (ii) social \nconcerns, (iii) security and terrorism, (iv) contamination \nof food and water, (v) water resources, (vi) geology, (vii) \nquality assurance, (viii) accidents and cleanup plans, (ix) \nhuman exposure from both accidents and normal oper-\nations, (x) types of canisters and monitoring systems, \n(xi) decommissioning and financial assurance, (xii) loca-\ntion of electric lines and estimates of electric use, and \n(xiii) transfer of fuel from damaged canisters. \nResponse:  In developing the EIS for the proposed \nCISF, the NRC staff will review and evaluate infor-\nmation and analyses provided in the applicant\u2019s license \napplication and supplemental documentation.  In addi-\ntion, the NRC staff will independently collect and re-\nview additional information related to the proposed \nCISF project and its environs.  If the NRC staff deter-\nmines that the information provided in the applicant\u2019s \nlicense application is not sufficient (e.g., missing or in-\naccurate) or cannot be independently gathered to allow \ncompletion of the EIS, the staff will submit requests for \nadditional information (RAIs) to the applicant to re-\nquest the information.  As needed, the NRC staff will \nrequest an updated and revised ER and SAR, and these \nrevised documents will be made publicly available, as \nappropriate. \n\n85 \n \nComments:  (3-31-2) (4-3-3) (4-4-1) (4-4-3) (4-4-4) (134-5) \n(134-8) (134-11) (134-16) (134-17) (134-21) (134-23) (138-\n2) (139-2) (139-14) (165-1) (165-3) (165-5) (174-1) (408-\n24) (460-1) (460-4) (491-10) (517-1) (517-15) (517-16) \n(518-10) (518-11) (518-12) (518-14) (523-13) (527-7) (527-\n13) (539-8) (545-9) (570-5) (570-6) (598-4) (599-1) (599-2) \n(819-47) \nB.2 \nComments Concerning NEPA Process\u2014Public \nParticipation  \nB.2.1 NEPA Process: Public Participation\u2014Requests \nfor More Public Meetings \nThe NRC received many comments requesting addi-\ntional public scoping meetings or suggesting locations \nfor additional public scoping meetings.  Many of the \ncomments requested public meetings along transporta-\ntion routes or near sites from which the SNF could be \nshipped.  Some commenters referenced the number and \nlocations of meetings held by the U.S Department of \nEnergy (DOE) or for the proposed Yucca Mountain re-\npository.  Some of the comments also requested that the \npublic comment period be extended.  Some comments \nnoted that additional public meetings were not held \nonce the license application review was re-opened. \nResponse:  In a January 30, 2017 FRN, the NRC staff \nannounced the dates, times, and locations for two public \ncomment meetings that the staff would host as part of \nits scoping process for the environmental review of the \nISP license application (82 FR 8771).  These meetings \nwere held in Hobbs, New Mexico, on February 13, 2017, \nand in Andrews, Texas on February 15, 2017.  The NRC \nstaff also hosted two webcast-based public comment \nmeetings held in Rockville, Maryland on February 23, \n2017 and April 6, 2017.  In preparation for these meet-\n\n86 \n \nings, the NRC issued a press release and made infor-\nmation related to the license application review availa-\nble to communities local to the proposed project, as well \nas on the NRC\u2019s website, such that the information was \naccessible nationwide. \nComments:  (1-12-2) (1-17-7) (2-13-8) (2-22-2) (2-22-6)  \n(3-12-2) (3-17-1) (12-2) (28-2) (58-2) (139-7) (149-2) (165-\n13) (165-15) (171-13) (195-1) (333-2) (345-2) (350-1) (408-\n10) (412-3) (429-3) (469-5) (512-5) (517-4) (557-3) (564-8) \n(663-4) (784-2) \nB.4.2 Proposed Action \u2013 De Facto Disposal \nThe NRC staff received a large number of comments \nexpressing concern that the proposed CISF would not \nbe an interim storage facility but would instead become \na de facto disposal site.  Commenters stated that the fa-\ncility would become a de facto disposal site because \nthere was no intention to move the SNF twice (i.e., once \nfrom the generation site and once to the final reposi-\ntory).  Some commenters stated concern that licensing \nthe proposed CISF would reduce the need for and like-\nlihood of construction of a permanent repository, or that \nbecause there is currently no final permanent reposi-\ntory available, that this interim facility would be a de \nfacto disposal site.  Some commenters were concerned \nthat once the proposed CISF is licensed, Congress \nwould have little incentive to fund and build a perma-\nnent repository.  Some commenters were concerned \nthat the interim proposed CISF would not be built to \nthe same standards as a permanent repository should \nthe proposed CISF become a de facto disposal site.  \nCommenters stated that the EIS should address the im-\npacts of the proposed CISF becoming permanent by de-\nfault.  Commenters expressed concern about the main-\n\n87 \n \ntenance of canisters and casks over the timeframe of the \nproposed project, stating that the timeframe would be \nindefinite. \nResponse:  The proposed action is to construct and op-\nerate a CISF for SNF, providing an option for storage \nof the spent fuel before a permanent repository is avail-\nable.  The EIS will evaluate the impacts of the proposed \naction for the license term of the proposed facility, \nwhich is 40 years.  If the license is approved, the licen-\nsee will have the option to apply for a license renewal \nunder 10 CFR 72.42.  However, the environmental anal-\nysis for the EIS assumes that fuel will be transported \naway from the CISF and that decommissioning of the \nCISF would occur at the end of the initial 40-year li-\ncense period.  In accordance with 10 CFR 51.23(b), \n51.80(b)(1), and 51.97(a), with respect to analysis of po-\ntential environmental impacts of storage beyond the li-\ncense term of the facility, the impact determinations in \nthe Continued Storage GEIS, NUREG\u20132157 (NRC, \n2014), shall be deemed incorporated into the EIS for the \nproposed CISF.  As explained in the Continued Storage \nGEIS, consistent with current national policy, disposal \nin a permanent repository is feasible (see Appendix B \nof the GEIS).  Therefore, evaluation of impacts of SNF \ndisposal or indefinite storage at the proposed CISF are \noutside the scope of this EIS.  Additional discussion re-\ngarding the scope of the EIS with respect to safety of \ncanisters and casks and transportation can be found in \nSection B.26 [Safety] and Sections B.9 and B.10 [Trans-\nportation]. \nComments:  (1-9-3) (1-12-6) (1-13-3) (1-13-4) (1-16-1)  \n(2-5-1) (2-5-3) (2-8-2) (2-8-10) (2-9-1) (2-9-7) (2-10-5) (2-\n17-2) (2-20-2) (3-5-10) (3-13-7) (3-16-4) (3-24-1) (3-31-5) \n(4-9-3) (4-14-6) (4-14-8) (21-3) (24-2) (28-12) (28-18) (30-\n\n88 \n \n3) (30-19) (38-5) (87-4) (98-9) (99-16) (100-2) (101-3) (111-\n6) (121-4) (127-2) (127-6) (130-1) (132-2) (134-13) (140-1) \n(142-5) (146-3) (164-9) (165-8) (165-22) (165-32) (169-3) \n(171-8) (175-3) (220-20) (277-2) (280-1) (318-4) (335-2) \n(339-12) (395-3) (406-1) (408-20) (408-22) (421-3) (436-2) \n(439-2) (443-2) (444-1) (460-11) (461-1) (463-1) (470-5) \n(476-5) (491-8) (502-2) (502-3) (511-3) (511-21) (517-14) \n(521-1) (522-9) (523-3) (523-7) (525-3) (525-4) (530-5) \n(539-6) (545-4) (545-6) (554-11) (556-2) (559-19) (560-7) \n(570-4) (576-15) (589-1) (598-2) (599-3) (620-13) (645-15) \n(650-2) (650-4) (663-3) (815-7) (819-2) (819-6) (819-7) \n(819-15) (819-17) \nB.5 \nComments Concerning the Purpose and Need of \nthe Proposed Action \nB.5.1 Purpose and Need for a CISF \nThe NRC received comments about the purpose and \nneed for the CISF.  Some commenters stated that stor-\nage facilities like ISP are needed to provide storage for \nSNF currently stored at individual sites.  Other com-\nmenters stated that the proposed CISF would cause thou-\nsands of unnecessary SNF waste shipments throughout \nthe U.S.  Commenters expressed differing opinions on \nwhether the purpose and need would or would not ad-\ndress the need of long-term storage of SNF.  Several \ncommenters stated that construction of a CISF would \nnot solve the issue of SNF disposal.  Other commenters \nnoted that there is no need for a CISF and that SNF \ncan be stored safely at reactor sites for as many years \nas it would remain at a CISF. \nResponse:  Absent findings in the NRC\u2019s safety review \nor NEPA analysis that the proposed facility does not \nmeet regulatory requirements, the NRC has no role in \nthe planning decisions of private entities.  An EIS dis-\n\n89 \n \ncusses the purpose and need for the proposed action to \nestablish a range of reasonable alternatives, in addition \nto the proposed action, that can satisfy the underlying \nneed. \nComments:  (1-6-1) (1-7-2) (1-11-3) (1-18-7) (2-20-1) (2-\n28-2) (2-29-2) (3-27-1) (4-25-2) (5-1) (27-1) (30-1) (32-1) \n(42-1) (63-3) (134-2) (140-9) (146-2) (180-2) (220-4) (400-\n5) (447-3) (460-3) (461-2) (470-6) (512-1) (517-3) (559-2) \n(576-14) (645-8) \nB.5.2 Purpose and Need\u2014NRC\u2019s Continued Storage \nGEIS and the Proposed CISF \nThe NRC staff received one comment stating that the \nER\u2019s purpose and need statement regarding the safety \nof the proposed CISF compared to the continued stor-\nage of SNF at reactors or Independent Spent Fuel Stor-\nage Installation (ISFSIs) contradicts the NRC\u2019s Con-\ntinued Storage GEIS. \nResponse:  The NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 51, Ap-\npendix A, require an EIS to include a description of the \npurpose of, and a discussion of the need for, a proposed \naction.  The NRC staff guidance in NUREG\u20131748 \n(NRC, 2003) regarding the preparation of the purpose \nand need analysis in the applicant\u2019s ER and the NRC \nstaff\u200a\u2019s EIS states that the applicant and the NRC staff \ntreatment of this subject should explain \u201cwhy the pro-\nposed action is needed,\u201d going on to indicate that the \ndiscussions should describe the underlying need for the \nproposed action and \u201cshould not be written merely as a \njustification of the proposed action, nor to alter the \nchoice of alternatives.\u201d  In short, an applicant should de-\nscribe what will be accomplished as a result of the pro-\nposed action. \n\n90 \n \nThe applicant\u2019s ER states that the proposed CISF \nwould provide temporary storage of SNF for decommis-\nsioned shutdown sites in order to return the land to \ngreenfield status; reducing costs related to surveillance, \nmaintenance, emergency preparedness, and physical \nsecurity at current ISFSIs; and alleviating the need for \nconstructing new ISFSIs.  Safe storage at the proposed \nCISF is only one component of the applicant\u2019s stated \npurpose and need. \nFurthermore, the EIS will compare the impacts of the \nproposed action with the No-Action alternative but will \nnot provide a determination regarding which option is \n\u201csafer.\u201d  All NRC licensed sites, both at-reactor ISFSIs \nand CISFs, are required to be in compliance with \nNRC\u2019s safety, security, and environmental regulations. \nSimilarly, the Continued Storage GEIS, (NUREG\u2013\n2157) did not perform any qualitative analysis of the \nsafety benefits of at-reactor  * * *  .  \n*  *  *  *  * \nB.6.4 Assumptions\u2014Legal Framework of the Proposed \nCISF \nThe NRC staff received numerous comments regarding \nthe legality of licensing an interim storage facility.  Sev-\neral commenters noted that under current Federal law \n(i.e., the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended), \nSNF is prohibited from transport and storage at an in-\nterim storage facility.  One commenter stated that the \ngovernment, rather than a private company, should ad-\nminister all nuclear storage after the utilities relinquish \ncontrol.  Another commenter recommended that the \nNRC amend 10 CFR Part 72 to address any potential \ndifferences in personnel resources, equipment, and \nemergency preparedness. \n\n91 \n \nResponse:  The NRC has previously licensed a consoli-\ndated (away-from-reactor) interim spent fuel storage \ninstallation, and NRC regulations allow for licensing \nprivate away-from-reactor interim spent fuel installa-\ntions under 10 CFR Part 72.  The NRC allows licensed \nprivate transportation of spent fuel.  For more infor-\nmation on the NRC\u2019s regulation of spent fuel transpor-\ntation, see https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-transp. \nhtml.  Issues relating to title to spent fuel are primarily \noutside the scope of this EIS because who holds title will \nlikely not influence the environmental impacts of the \nproposed action.  The comment that the government ra-\nther than a private company should administer nuclear \nstorage is a matter of policy and is outside the scope of \nthis EIS. \nComments:  (1-18-6) (2-5-2) (2-8-3) (2-31-2) (3-2-3) (3-2-\n6) (3-12-7) (3-13-6) (3-31-1) (6-1) (28-21) (55-4) (134-12) \n(139-1) (139-3) (139-26) (160-1) (165-6) (165-30) (415-4) \n(425-1) (434-3) (436-8) (444-3) (467-1) (502-17) (511-2) \n(523-6) (525-7) (528-11) (539-23) (540-2) (545-25) (547-2) \n(549-2) (557-7) (557-9) (634-2) (803-4) (819-5) (819-14) \nB.7 \nComments Concerning Alternatives \nB.7.1 Alternatives\u2014Other \nThe NRC staff received several comments containing \nsuggestions for alternatives to a consolidated interim \nstorage facility for SNF (the proposed action) to be an-\nalyzed in the EIS.  The comments included the use of \nlasers, onsite vitrification, solar and lunar disposal, and \nreprocessing as suggested methods for disposal or \ntreatment of SNF.  One commenter suggested selling \nSNF to foreign governments.  Another commenter sug-\ngested different rock types for safe storage. \n\n92 \n \nResponse:  For the purpose of the NRC environmental \nreview of the proposed action, only alternatives that are \nconsidered reasonable or feasible and that would meet \nthe purpose and need will be analyzed in the EIS.  While \nsome suggested alternatives are innovative, only those \nalternatives that are currently available are considered \nreasonable or feasible.  Additional comments related to \nalternatives that are out of scope are in Section B.30 \n[Out of Scope].  For information on the scope of the pro-\nposed action see Section B.4 [Proposed Action].  Addi-\ntional comments on alternatives can be found in a sepa-\nrate response within this section of the report. \nComments:  (2-14-5) (3-18-1) (4-2-1) (8-1) (13-2) (172-1) \n(185-2) (187-1) (250-2) (270-2) (412-2) (412-20) (412-21) \n(449-1) (459-2) (480-2) (534-1) (625-1) (636-1) (689-1) \n(703-1) (773-1) (813-1) \nB.7.2 Alternatives\u2014Proposed Site Location \nThe NRC staff received comments about the use of al-\nternative sites for the proposed project and for long \nterm or permanent storage of the SNF.  Commenters \nsuggested storing SNF at existing licensed and operat-\ning ISFSIs, secured military bases, DOE-owned facili-\nties, states other than Texas, or leaving the SNF where \nit was generated and is currently stored.  Several com-\nmenters recommended consolidating fuel in areas close \nto the reactors to minimize transportation and risk.  \nSome commenters suggested moving SNF away from \nnatural hazards.  One commenter stated that CEQ guid-\nance required the NRC to evaluate reasonable alterna-\ntives including those not proposed by the applicant and \nthose outside the jurisdiction of the NRC.  A few com-\nmenters suggested modifying and monitoring existing \nspent fuel pools for SNF storage.  One commenter sug-\n\n93 \n \ngested burying the SNF where it is currently located.  \nAnother commenter suggested extending the licensed \nlife of current ISFSIs. \nResponse:  The NRC will evaluate the potential environ-\nmental impacts of the construction, operation, and de-\ncommissioning of the proposed CISF.  In the EIS, the \nNo-Action alternative will evaluate the potential im-\npacts of not constructing or operating the proposed \nCISF and leaving the SNF onsite at current locations \nas a baseline for comparison against the potential envi-\nronmental impacts of constructing and operating a \nCISF.  The scope of the EIS, with respect to safety and \ntransportation, is discussed in Sections B.10 and B.26, \n[Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel\u2014Safety/Acci-\ndents and Safety], respectively. \nComments:  (1-22-7) (2-18-6) (3-7-1) (3-7-4) (3-13-8) (3-\n15-1) (3-15-2) (3-15-4) (4-4-6) (4-14-5) (4-14-11) (4-23-2) \n(18-2) (28-23) (31-2) (41-2) (45-8) (54-2) (58-9) (63-4) (71-\n3) (73-2) (86-3) (100-4) (101-7) (110-3) (115-2) (115-6) \n(122-3) (142-9) (163-1) (164-12) (165-24) (165-27) (177-1) \n(192-3) (193-6) (196-1) (203-3) (208-1) (213-3) (217-3) \n(218-2) (242-1) (247-2) (250-1) (260-1) (266-1) (274-1) \n(284-5) (286-1) (288-1) (297-1) (318-1) (327-3) (329-3) \n(338-3) (342-4) (348-1) (365-2) (398-2) (412-8) (412-22) \n(413-2) (417-1) (418-1) (436-7) (442-1) (442-3) (454-3) \n(460-9) (466-2) (495-2) (508-5) (511-7) (522-10) (522-11) \n(550-2) (552-1) (559-4) (562-2) (563-5) (570-19) (571-17) \n(575-2) (575-4) (576-13) (579-2) (583-1) (586-2) (591-6) \n(600-1) (648-2) (653-2) (660-2) (662-2) (664-2) (669-5) \n(691-1) (704-2) (706-2) (766-2) (771-1) (775-2) (777-1) \n(779-4) (780-5) (784-1) (797-3) (803-2) (805-3) (815-5) \n(819-20) \n \n \n\n94 \n \nB.7.3 Alternatives\u2014Hardened Onsite Storage (HOSS) \nSeveral comments were received recommending that \nthe NRC consider HOSS or other similar additional \nprotections at existing sites as an alternative to the pro-\nposed action.  Some commenters requested that NRC \nconduct studies comparing the relative safety of HOSS \nto the proposed action. \nResponse:  The NRC\u2019s safety and environmental review \nis limited to an evaluation of the proposed CISF as de-\nscribed in ISP\u2019s license application.  The No-Action al-\nternative evaluates the potential impacts of leaving the \nSNF at current storage locations as a baseline for com-\nparison against the potential environmental impacts of \nconstructing and operating a proposed CISF.  HOSS \nand other onsite hardening concepts are not being ana-\nlyzed in detail because they do not meet the purpose and \nneed of the proposed action (construction and operation \nof a CISF).  Furthermore, this licensing action for a new \nfacility does not propose or impose safety requirements \nfor the storage of spent fuel at existing sites; therefore, \nassessing the impacts of HOSS and other hardened stor-\nage concepts at other sites will not be analyzed in this \nsite-specific licensing process. \nComments:  (3-15-3) (3-17-3) (3-19-7) (3-22-4) (3-28-2) (4-\n19-3) (58-5) (58-8) (118-5) (118-16) (121-2) (135-3) (163-\n2) (207-2) (321-2) (425-2) (434-1) (439-4) (468-8) (476-4) \n(515-2) (517-19) (519-8) (541-3) (570-1) (570-20) (573-4) \n(574-2) (632-2) (669-2) (779-3) (819-19) (819-32) \nB.8 \nComments Concerning Land Use \nB.8.1 Land Use\u2014General Comments \nThe NRC staff received comments that expressed con-\ncern about potential land use impacts from the proposed \n\n95 \n \nCISF, including economic effects and consequences \nfrom potential accidents or attacks that would affect the \nviability of the land for other uses.  Commenters ex-\npressed concerns about irreversible commitments of \nland use and the potential conflicts with natural areas, \ntourism, energy and mineral mining, agriculture, and \nrecreational activities in the area.  One commenter \nraised questions about subsurface mineral rights for the \noil and gas industry within the boundary of the pro-\nposed CISF.  The same commenter was also concerned \nabout the implication of subsurface extraction on in-\nduced seismicity and groundwater movement.  Another \ncommenter stated that the Texas-New Mexico state \nboundary may be inaccurate and implying that as a re-\nsult, the proposed CISF may be located entirely in the \nState of New Mexico.  One commenter stated that a \n2007 publication by the IAEA recommended any away-\nfrom-reactor storage be sited away from mineral explo-\nration, chemical manufacturing facilities, and airports. \nResponse:  The EIS will include a description of land use \nwithin the proposed project boundary and the sur-\nrounding area.  The impact assessment in the EIS will \nconsider impacts of construction, operation, and decom-\nmissioning of the proposed CISF on land use in the \narea, as well as a discussion of appropriate mitigation \nmeasures.  This assessment will discuss proposed land \nuse agreements and land ownership and will address \npotential conflicts with other nearby land uses, such as \nprohibitive mineral usage agreements.  However, be-\ncause the NRC does not have authority over nonnuclear \nprivate business ventures, specific business interests of \ncompanies will not be included in the scope.  The scope \nof the EIS with respect to industries in the area and \ntourism are discussed in this report in Sections B.18 \n\n96 \n \n[Socioeconomics].  Information on induced seismicity is \ndiscussed in Section B.14.3 [Geology and Soils\u2014In-\nduced Seismicity], and groundwater in Section B.12\u2014 \n[Groundwater Concerns\u2014Aquifers]. \nComments:  (6-10) (14-5) (16-6) (45-6) (84-2) (94-3) (102-\n5) (109-2) (408-4) (462-8) (502-25) (517-11) (542-1) (544-1)  \nB.8.2 Land Use\u2014Concerning HLW at the WCS Site \nThe NRC staff received comments on the use of land \nwithin the WCS site for storage of HLW.  Commenters \nnoted that the agreement and acceptance of the WCS \nfacility by the community was contingent on use of the \nfacility for non-HLW.  Commenters expressed disap-\npointment that the proposed action would allow the land \nat the WCS site (i.e., a portion of which would be the \nproposed location of the CISF) to be used to store SNF. \nResponse:  The EIS will include a description of land use \nwithin the proposed project boundary and the sur-\nrounding area.  The impact assessment in the EIS will \nconsider impacts of construction, operation, and decom-\nmissioning of the proposed CISF on land use in the \narea, as well as a discussion of appropriate mitigation \nmeasures.

Pursuant to the NWPA, the DOE was responsi-\nble for licensing Yucca Mountain with operations begin-\nning on January 31, 1998. \nOn July 23, 2002, President George W. Bush approved \nCongressional legislation designating Yucca Mountain \nas the final geologic repository intended for the disposal \nof commercial SNF and high level waste generated by \nthe federal government.  The DOE submitted a license \napplication to the NRC for authorization to construct \nand operate Yucca Mountain.  The NRC reviewed the \nlicense application and issued a series of Safety Evalu-\nation Reports addressing the long-term environmental \nperformance of Yucca Mountain.  However, much un-\ncertainty remains as to whether or not the facility will \nopen and begin accepting commercial SNF or high level \nwaste for disposal. \nIn January 2010, President Barack Obama established \nthe Blue Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Fu-\nture.  The Commission was directed by the Secretary of \nEnergy to conduct a comprehensive review of policies \nfor managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle and \nto recommend a new strategy.  On January 26, 2012, the \nBlue Ribbon Commission issued a final report consist-\ning of eight key recommendations.  Of paramount im-\nportance to this licensing action was the Blue Ribbon \n\n99 \n \nCommission\u2019s recommendation to adopt a new consent-\nbased approach to siting future nuclear waste manage-\nment facilities in order to initiate prompt efforts to de-\nvelop one or more consolidated storage facilities. \nDevelopment of the CISF has strong support from the \nstate, regional, and local communities located in west \nTexas.  In March 2014, Texas Governor Rick Perry \ncalled for a Texas solution for SNF generated at 6 reac-\ntor sites located in the state.  On September 19, 2014, \nthe Texas Radiation Advisory Board also issued a posi-\ntion stating it is in the state\u2019s best interest to request \nthat the federal government consider Texas as a CISF \nsite.  On January 20, 2015, the Andrews County Com-\nmissioners unanimously approved a resolution in sup-\nport of establishing an Independent Spent Fuel Storage \nInstallation (ISFSI) in Andrews County, Texas, for the \nconsolidated interim storage of SNF and high level ra-\ndioactive waste (Attachment 1-1). \n*  *  *  *  * \ntheir area.  This resulted in the identification of four \ncounties in two states that were subjected to a rigorous \ntwo-tier screening process evaluating 15 criteria rang-\ning from local political support and land availability to \noperational considerations and environmental impacts.  \nUltimately, this process resulted in the identification of \nAndrews County, Texas as the site for the Proposed Ac-\ntion.  The other Location Alternatives were eliminated \nfrom detailed analysis.  Details are provided in this sec-\ntion. \n2.3.1  Site Selection Process:  Region of Interest \nThe site selection process was initiated pursuant to \nNEPA by identifying seven states located in the more \n\n100 \n \narid western regions of the U.S.  The states considered \nincluded Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New \nMexico, Texas, and Utah.  ISP believes that selecting \nstates with sparsely populated areas and relatively arid \nclimates was an important step in the site selection pro-\ncess due to many of the concerns about storage of SNF \npreviously raised by people in more densely populated \nareas.  ISP also believes that a CISF should only be lo-\ncated in a state that has voiced its support for hosting \nsuch a facility.  Of these seven states, only stakeholders \nin New Mexico and Texas have expressed an interest in \nhosting a CISF within their borders. \nIn March 2014, Texas Governor Rick Perry stated his \nsupport for siting a CISF in Texas.  He directed the \nTCEQ to prepare a report addressing the challenges \nposed by the presence of SNF and other High Level \nWaste currently stored at the four commercial nuclear \npower reactors in Texas.  On March 28, 2014, Governor \nPerry, in a letter to Lieutenant Governor David \nDewhurst, voiced his support for storing SNF in Texas.  \nHe also forwarded the report prepared by the TCEQ \nentitled, Assessment of Texas\u2019 High Level Radioactive \nWaste Storage Options.  The TCEQ recognized that\u2014\nwhile SNF currently stored in Texas is safe\u2014it is not \nan adequate long-term solution and that a program \nneeded to be established in a community that was will-\ning to host such a facility.  The TCEQ suggested that \n\u201cin looking at how to successfully site a facility, one \nshould take into account current successfully sited and \nbuilt radioactive waste disposal facilities such as the \nWaste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico for transu-\nranic waste and the Low Level Radioactive Waste Fa-\ncility in Texas.\u201d \n\n101 \n \nOn April 10, 2015, New Mexico Governor Susana Mar-\ntinez voiced her support for a consent-based approach \nto locate a CISF in southeastern New Mexico, Attach-\nment 2-1.  She stated that such a facility was necessary \ngiven that millions of dollars of taxpayer funds were \ncurrently being spent on monitoring and oversight of \nSNF each year, and millions more were expended in  \n* * *  . \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe assumed schedule of plant shutdowns is based \nupon the expiration date of each plant\u2019s existing per-\nmit.  Although it is recognized that some plants may \nseek to extend their operating license, it is also likely \nthat other plants will choose to shut down prior to \nreaching the end of their licensed operating period.  \nMany plants have more than one reactor, so the as-\nsumed shutdown date for a plant is when the final op-\nerating reactor's permit expires.  By Year 3 of the \nCISF\u2019s licensure, which is when it is assumed to be per-\nmitted to accept spent nuclear fuel, there will be ten \nshutdown nuclear power plants, eight of which could \nimmediately send spent nuclear fuel canisters to the \nCISF. \n \n \n\n102 \n \nFrom: \n \n Michael Lozano PBPA <Michael@pbpa. \ninfo> \nSent:  \n \n Wednesday, July 29, 2020 6:04 PM \nTo:   \n \n WCS_CISFEIS Resource \nSubject:  \n[External_Sender] Docket No. 72-1050; \nNRC-2016-0231 \nAttachments: PBPA Letter to NRC.pdf \nPlease see the attached letter from the Permian Basin \nPetroleum Association and feel free to let me know if \nyou have any questions. \nBest, \nMDL \nMichael D.

The PBPA takes the \nposition that the Draft Environmental Impact State-\nments (Draft EIS) are inadequate as to the risk the fa-\ncilities pose to impacts on the Permian Basin which is \nthe most active, thriving and prolific oilfield in the \nUnited States. \nThe PBPA was founded in 1961 to advocate for the safe \nand responsible development of our nation\u2019s natural re-\nsources in the Permian Basin and we represents the in-\nterests of our local oil and gas operators in Texas, New \nMexico, and Washington, D.C.  Today we write you to \ndefend that founding principle. While the PBPA fully \nsupports an all-of-the above energy strategy for Amer-\n\n106 \n \nica, including nuclear energy, we have grave concerns \nthat the siting of these facilities will jeopardize energy \nproduction.  Our concerns with the proposals are not the \ngeneration of nuclear energy or the operations of cur-\nrent facilities in either state, but that the risk of the \ncountry\u2019s continued energy independence has not been \nadequately weighed against these projects to include \nthe investment which substantially contributes to the \nTexas and New Mexico economic security and work-\nforce development and retention. \nThe following information from the Texas Taxpayers \nand Research Association\u2019s report \u201cThe Permian Ba-\nsin:  Enriching Texas,\u201d highlights the region\u2019s promi-\nnence in both oilfield production and state economic \ncontributions.  The Permian Basin comprises 26 percent \nof Texas\u2019 land area and is home to one of the thickest \ndeposits of rock from the Permian Period (251 to 299 \nmillion years ago).  It contains numerous oil and gas \nproducing formations.  In April 2019, Forbes Magazine \nnamed it the \u201cWorld\u2019s Top Oil Producer,\u201d replacing \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Ghawar oilfield.  With about 40,000 ac-\ntive oil and gas wells in New Mexico\u2019s portion of the Per-\nmian Basin and more than 250,000 in Texas\u2019 portion, the \nimpact of the oil and gas sector is vast.  And it is proven. \nIn 2019 in Texas alone, the Permian Basin was respon-\nsible for $9 billion in severance taxes and royalties paid \nto the state to utilize widely in basic functions of  \ngovernment\u2014that amounted to $312 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the state, or the equivalent of $937 \nfor a family of three.  Absent this revenue, the average \nTexan would either have had to accept a lower amount \nof services from state and local governments or would \nhave had to pay that much more in taxes.  In New Mex-\nico, conservative estimates show that nearly 40% of all \n\n107 \n \nstate revenue is generated directly from oil and gas pro-\nduction taxes.  There is simply no way to over empha-\nsize the importance of this region. \nOur members firmly believe that authorizing these fa-\ncilities would threaten the real value of the region \nthrough mineral extraction in order to establish an en-\nterprise that has never been attempted, would warrant \na greater and more thorough evaluation.  For example, \nin New Mexico, much of the proposed siting would \nthreaten already executed legal contracts for operators \nwho, in good faith, invested in leasing the area for min-\neral exploration and development for oil and gas pro-\nduction.  The Draft EIS does not consider mineral \nrights which are paramount to the success of an oilfield.  \nThe dismissal or negligent overlooking of these con-\ntracted agreements between government parties and \nprivate operators is a dangerous precedent that would \nnever have the PBPA\u2019s support or hold up in a court of \nlaw. \nFurther, the concept of interim storage also concerns \nour members greatly.  While we recognize the concerns \nof current spent nuclear fuel storage at reactor sites, \nthat issue better begs the immediate approval of a per-\nmanent disposal facility, like was envisioned at Yucca \nMountain, not moving the spent nuclear fuel twice\u2014 \nonce to a consolidated interim storage facility and then \nagain for final disposition.  Without knowing the length \nof the timeline being considered as \u201cinterim\u201d and the \nquestion of solvency for the private operators of these \nsites, our members firmly oppose the current license \napplications in Andrews County, Texas, and Eddy-Lea \nCounty, New Mexico. \n\n108 \n \nWe greatly appreciate your review of our comments and \nlook forward to working with you to ensure that the \nPermian Basin remains America\u2019s Oilfield. \nSincerely, \n[s] \nBen Shepperd \nPresident \n \n\n109 \n \nOfficial Transcript of Proceedings \nNUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \nTitle:  \n \nPublic Online Webinar for the \nDraft \nEnvironmental \nImpact \nStatement for the Proposed In-\nterim Storage Partners Consoli-\ndated Interim Storage Facility  \nDocket Number: \n72-1050 \nLocation: \nwebinar \nDate:  \n \nThursday, October 15, 2020 \nWork Order No.:  \nNRC-1102                       Pages 1-188 \n \n \n \n \nNEAL R.

And thank you again. \nAnd, Terry, I believe Monica is the next speaker. \nOPERATOR:  Yes.  We have Monica Perales next, \nand then, Richard Faidley, Erica Gray, and Lon Bur-\nnam. \nAnd, Monica, your line is now open. \nMS. PERALES:  Yes, ma\u2019am.  Thank you. \nHello.  My name is Monica Perales.  I\u2019m on the legal \nteam representing Fasken Oil and Ranch and the Per-\nmian Basin Coalition. \nFirst, let me say to Bruce, the commenter from Mar-\nyland, those of us out here with the target on our backs, \nwe\u2019re Andrews County, not Anderson County. \nRegarding the NRC and ISP DEIS, I continue to be \ndisappointed in your failure to justify or even explain \nwhy you\u2019re in such a rush to license the CISF that you \ncannot put the public participation element on hold until \nthis pandemic has passed and true public [78] meetings \ncan be held. \nBy engaging in the licensing of what\u2019s actually mon-\nitored retrievable storage and failing to take into ac-\ncount the position of the State of Texas, you are circum-\nventing our rights, the rights of the State of Texas. \nYou\u2019re most definitely aware that the Governor of the \nState of Texas has sent a letter to the President in which \n\n112 \n \nthe State of Texas makes it clear that we are opposed to \nISP\u2019s CISF.  And let me clearer to you.  Rick Perry may \nbe invested in getting this facility licensed, but Greg \nAbbott is our Governor. \nNow, regarding the DEIS section on environmental \njustice, in your rush to license the facility and your as-\nsumption of low risk, your DEIS failed to provide an ob-\njective and thorough analysis of impact to low-income \nand minority populations.  In fact, you dismissed the \nlarge percentage of Spanish speakers in the immediate \nvicinity of the CISF and of the rail route. \nI searched, and the NRC website public meeting no-\ntices are in English only, and the meeting notice in An-\ndrews, Texas, in their small paper, it was only in Eng-\nlish.  So, if the DEIS is only published in English, why \ndo you bother having an interpreter available, when the \nmaterials that are the subject of [79] this discussion are \nonly available in English? \nYour DEIS fails to accurately account for the salt \nplayas and the environmental conditions out here in the \narea of the ISP that will contribute to chloride-induced \nstress corrosion cracking. \nYour DEIS also presents a misleading view of the \ncurrent tectonic state around the proposed site.  Be-\nsides the description of the tectonic uplift of the Central \nBasin Platform as it resides today, it describes the plat-\nform as being steeply fault-bounded uplift of basement \nrocks, and it describes the steep-angle faulting that \nbounds the platform\u2019s edges. \nNow, while this description is true for the western \nflank of the platform, it fails to disclose the heavily \nfaulted nature of the platform itself in and around the \n\n113 \n \nsite.  It fails to report on the cause of the platform\u2019s ro-\ntation, which is causing major deformation and instabil-\nity within the platform itself.  Due to the nature of the \ntectonic setting and the degree of rotation, the western \nside of the platform has greater structural relief, verti-\ncal separation, and basement shortening. \nI\u2019m trying to be brief, but what I have to say is im-\nportant because it shows that the area of the ISP site is \nthe least stable region of the Central [80] Basin Plat-\nform from a structural geology standpoint, and it has \nundergone more fault reactivation in its history than \nthe rest of the platform. \nThe DEIS describes the shallow faults in the area.  \nHowever, most earthquake epicenters in the ISP site \nare at depths related to the basement faulting.  The risk \nin the area comes from reactivation of basement faults.  \nThey propagate energy faults at the surface, not like or-\ndinary age faulting. \nSo, the DEIS is severely lacking.  It is apparent that \nyou chose to base your DEIS findings and focus your \nanalysis on hazards that are lower risk to the site.  Your \nomission of the obvious risk posed by basement faults \nvoids your finding of low risk and it calls into question \nthe reality of your results overall. \nI\u2019d like to discuss the probabilistic seismic hazard \nanalysis utilized in the DEIS.  The analysis that is used \nhas been widely discounted by scientists and engineers \nfor decades, as they include parameters known to con-\njure the constants in earthquake physics. \nMajor tectonic events have occurred in areas previ-\nously deemed low risk by your models.  Your models \ncannot create an accurate risk of future [81] earth-\n\n114 \n \nquakes.  There are multiple scholarly, accredited sources \nthat have discredited the models that you rely upon. \nYour data is based on aboveground seismic monitor-\ning stations, which are often moved.  That leads to is-\nsues of effective measurement, the proper coupling to \nthe earth, and local noise variations.  The data reported \nin your DEIS has only been monitored since the 1970s.  \nYet, it\u2019s being used to determine seismic event risk up \nto 100 years into the future, or over two times the length \nof time that has been monitored. \nThe errors in the models cited in the DEIS are \nclearly known by the NRC, as you published internal \ndocuments discussing the large amount of uncertainties \nin these models.  And you\u2019ve gone as far as to clearly \nstate that many of the problems with your models will \nnot even be thought of, as they\u2019re so limited in scope. \nReliance upon WCS affidavits on basement faulting \nand your reliance upon faulting models for determining \nthe degree of strength in the cask design, but also the \nsite integrity itself warrants disqualification of your \nDEIS. \nTo the listeners, finally, I ask you to visit  \nprotectthebasin.com and join us in opposition.  \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n\n115 \n \nPUBLIC SUBMISSION \nAs of:  11/4/20 9:04 AM \nReceived:  November 03, \n2020 \nStatus:  Pending_Post \nTracking \nNo. \nkh2-godn-\n18tm \nComments Due:  November \n03, 2020 \nSubmission Type:  Web \nDocket:  NRC-2016-0231 \nWaste Control Specialists LLC\u2019s Consolidated Interim \nSpent Fuel Storage Facility Project \nComment On:  NRC-2016-0231-0317 \nInterim Storage Partners Consolidated Interim Stor-\nage Facility Project \nDocument:  NRC-2016-0231-DRAFT-0371 \nComment on FR Doc # 2020-09795 \nSubmitter Information \nEmail:   james.sullivan@gov.texas.gov \nGovernment Agency Type:   State \nGovernment Agency:  Office of the Governor of Texas \n \n \n \n\n116 \n \nGeneral Comment \nOn behalf of Governor Abbott, I hereby submit the at-\ntached comment in Docket ID NRC-2016-0231. \nJames P.

This \n\n118 \n \ndeadly radioactive waste\u2014up to 40,000 metric tons of \nuranium\u2014would sit right on the surface of the facility \nin dry cask storage systems.  Spent nuclear fuel is so \ndangerous that it belongs in a deep geologic repository, \nnot on a concrete pad above ground in Andrews County.  \nSee, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(18); Nevada v. DOE, 457 \nF.3d 78, 81 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  This location could not be \nworse for storing ultra-hazardous radioactive waste. \nAndrews County lies within the Permian Basin Region, \nwhich has surpassed Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ghawar Field as \nthe largest producing oilfield in the world.  There are ap-\nproximately 250,000 active oil-and-gas wells in Texas\u2019s \nportion of the Permian Basin.  In 2019, oil production in \nthe Permian Basin exceeded 1.5 billion barrels, and the \noil-and-gas industry directly employed 87,603 individu-\nals in the region.  Also in 2019, the Permian Basin was \nresponsible for $9 billion in severance taxes and royal-\nties to the State of Texas.  In 2018, the Permian Basin \nproduced more than 30 percent of total U.S. crude oil \nand contained more than 40 percent of proved oil re-\nserves.  In short, the Permian Basin is a significant eco-\nnomic and natural resource for the entire country. \nThe proposed ISP facility imperils America\u2019s energy se-\ncurity because it would be a prime target for attacks by \nterrorists, saboteurs, and other enemies.  Spent nuclear \nfuel is currently scattered across the country at various \nreactor sites and storage installations.  Piling it up on \nthe surface of the Permian Basin, as ISP seeks to do, \nwould allow a terrorist with a bomb or a hijacked air-\ncraft to cause a major radioactive release that could \ntravel hundreds of miles on the region\u2019s high winds.  \nSuch an attack would be uniquely catastrophic because, \non top of the tragic loss of human life, it would disrupt \nthe country\u2019s energy supply by shutting down the \n\n119 \n \nworld\u2019s largest producing oilfield.  The Permian Basin \nis already a target for America\u2019s enemies, and granting \nISP\u2019s license application would paint an even bigger \nbullseye. \nUnder the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, \nthe NRC has an obligation to consider the environmen-\ntal effects of a terrorist attack on the proposed ISP fa-\ncility.  See Mothers for Peace v. NRC, 449 F.3d 1016, \n1028-35 (9th Cir. 2006); but see N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. \nv. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 136-43 (3d Cir. 2009) (creating \ncircuit split on issue); New York v. NRC, 589 F.3d 551, \n554 n.1 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (avoiding circuit split \nbecause \u201cthe NRC did sufficiently take into account acts \nof terrorism\u201d).  Perhaps recognizing as much, the NRC \naddressed the risk of terrorism in section 4.19 of its Ge-\nneric Environmental Impact Statement for Continued \nStorage of Spent Nuclear Fuel.  See 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.23 \n(cross-referencing NUREG-2157).  The Generic Envi-\nronmental Impact Statement determined (at page 4-97) \nthat terrorism\u2019s \u201cenvironmental risk is SMALL\u201d during \nthe period beyond a facility\u2019s license term.  But see 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2210e (reflecting Congress\u2019s judgment that the \nrisk of a terrorist attack on a nuclear facility warrants \nthe NRC\u2019s careful attention). \nNow, in sections 1.4.4 and 5.1.3 of the Draft Environ-\nmental Impact Statement for the license application in \nAndrews County, the NRC apparently seeks to apply \nits generic terrorism determination to ISP.  The pro-\nposed ISP facility, however, would be a uniquely pro-\nvocative target:  The probability of a terrorist attack is \nhigher than for a generic reactor site, because the con-\nsequences are higher when a terrorist can disrupt the \ncountry\u2019s energy supply with a major radioactive re-\nlease.  So the Generic Environmental Impact Statement \n\n120 \n \ndoes not adequately assess terrorism risk as to ISP in \nparticular, while the Draft Environmental Impact \nStatement does not speak to that issue at all.  Indeed, \nthe word \u201cterrorism\u201d appears just once, in a mere cita-\ntion, in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (at \npage 2-31). \nAlthough the Draft Environmental Impact Statement \nrepeatedly refers to ISP\u2019s construction and operation of \na \u201cconsolidated interim storage facility,\u201d it would be na-\n\u00efve to believe the highlighted word.  ISP\u2019s application \nseeks a 40-year license, with the possibility of a 20-year \nrenewal.  The Draft Environmental Impact Statement \nsimply assumes (at pages xix, 1-3, 2-2, 8-1, 9-16) that a \npermanent geologic repository will be developed and li-\ncensed before those 60 years are up, without addressing \nany contingency for the spent nuclear fuel if such a re-\npository is not ready when ISP\u2019s license expires.  Those \nrosy assumptions are unsound:  Radioactive waste has \n\u201cthe capacity to outlast human civilization as we know \nit,\u201d Nuclear Energy Inst., Inc. v. EPA, 373 F.3d 1251, \n1257 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (per curiam), and any spent nu-\nclear fuel that comes to the proposed ISP facility will be \nthere to stay. \nCongress began working on a lasting solution to the \nspent nuclear fuel problem by passing the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1982, which set standards for a per-\nmanent geologic repository, and the NWPA Amend-\nments Act of 1987, which designated Yucca Mountain as \nthe only site for it.  Today, 38 years later, there is still \nno permanent geologic repository, with Yucca Mountain \neffectively having been abandoned.  See, e.g., New York \nv. NRC, 824 F.3d 1012, 1014-15 (D.C. Cir. 2016); In re \nAiken County, 645 F.3d 428, 430-33 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  \nOnce again, then, \u201c[t]he [NRC] apparently has no long-\n\n121 \n \nterm plan other than hoping for a geologic repository.  \nIf the government continues to fail in its quest to estab-\nlish one, then [spent nuclear fuel] will seemingly be \nstored on site at nuclear plants on a permanent basis.  \nThe [NRC] can and must assess the potential environ-\nmental effects of such a failure.\u201d  New York v. NRC, 681 \nF.3d 471, 479 (D.C. Cir. 2012). \nThe Generic Environmental Impact Statement con-\ncedes (at page 4-95) that \u201cadditional security require-\nments may be necessary in the future if spent fuel re-\nmains in storage for a substantial period of time.  Under \nthose circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that, if \nnecessary, the NRC will issue orders or enhance its reg-\nulatory requirements for ISFSI and DTS security, as \nappropriate, to ensure adequate protection of public \nhealth and safety and the common defense and secu-\nrity.\u201d  This approach to future terrorist threats\u2014  \nessentially, a promise of I\u2019ll tell you later\u2014is not good \nenough and does not protect Texas and its citizens. \nFinally, safe transportation of spent nuclear fuel would \nrequire specialized emergency response equipment and \ntrained personnel, as well as significant infrastructure \ninvestments.  Texas currently has four counties (Bexar, \nDallas, Midland, and Nueces) and one city (San Anto-\nnio) that have passed resolutions prohibiting the trans-\nportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.  Ac-\ncording to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement \n(at page 3-8), the cargo currently shipped on rail lines \nthrough the Permian Basin consists primarily of \u201coil-\nfield commodities such as drilling mud, hydrochloric \nacid, fracking sand, pipe, and petroleum products, in-\ncluding crude oil, as well as iron and steel scrap.\u201d  There \nare also significant agricultural commodities.  In the \nevent of a rail accident or derailment, even absent a ra-\n\n122 \n \ndiological release, the resources and logistics required \nto address such an accident would severely disrupt the \ntransportation of oilfield and agricultural commodities, \nto the detriment of the entire country. \nIn light of the grave risks associated with the proposed \nISP facility, the absence of a permanent geologic repos-\nitory, and the importance of the Permian Basin to the \ncountry\u2019s energy security and economy, I respectfully \nand emphatically request that the NRC deny ISP\u2019s li-\ncense application. \nSincerely, \n/s/ GREG ABBOTT \nGREG ABBOTT \nGovernor \nGA:jsk \ncc: The Honorable Dan Brouillette, Secretary, U.S. \nDepartment of Energy \n \nThe Honorable Chad F.

The Fasken staff com-\n\n126 \n \nments are presented in Attachment 1 and consultant \ncomments are presented in Attachment 2.  \nThere are systemic regulatory failures in multiple areas \nof the DEIS demonstrating unrealistic attempts to \nachieve a zero-risk outcome, as well as a lack of aware-\nness to risk trade-offs and reluctance by the NRC to re-\nalistically compare benefits to costs and adopt the most \nefficient regulatory alternative. \nFor the record, PBLRO and FLML wish to reempha-\nsize the fact that Governor Abbott of Texas has again \nstated his opposition to the approval of the ISP CISF, \ntoday, November 3, 2020.  If the NRC were following \nthe statutory requirements of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, the opposition by the host governor to a proposed \nCISF site that serves the purpose described in law for \na Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility would \nbe sufficient to end the NRC licensing activity. \nThe absence of Governor Abbott\u2019s approval will also ad-\nversely impact the required approvals by Texas state \nagencies that are assumed to be granted in the DEIS \nWe look forward to the NRC\u2019s responses to our con-\ncerns. \n \nSincerely, \n/s/ MONICA PERALES \nMONICA PERALES \nAttorney for Fasken Land and Minerals, Ltd. and \nPermian Basin Coalition of Land and Royalty Own-\ners and Operators  \n \n \n\n127 \n \nATTACHMENT 1 \n \n \n\n128 \n \nReview of ISP DEIS, ML20122A220 \nPermian Basis Coalition of Land and Royalty Owners \nand Operators (PBLRO) & Fasken Land and Minerals \nLimited (FLML) \nSubject:  Permian Basis Coalition of Land and Royalty \nOwners and Operators (PBLRO) and Fasken Land and \nMinerals Limited (FLML), comments and concerns re-\ngarding the NRC\u2019s Draft Environmental Impact State-\nment (DEIS, ML20122A220) for Interim Storage Part-\nners LLC\u2019s (ISP) license application for a Consolidated \nInterim Storage Facility (CISF) for Spent Nuclear \nFuel (SNF) in Andrews County, Texas. \nGeophysical Properties of the Central Basin Platform \n(CBP) \nSection 3.4.1.2 and Stratigraphy \nIssue:  The geological history of the basin as reported \nin the DEIS (Section 3.4) is adequate but presents a \nmisleading view of the current tectonic state around the \nISP\u2019s proposed site location. \nThe DEIS cites the (Hills, 1985) description of the tec-\ntonic uplift that occurred during the Mississippian and \nPennsylvanian ages that setup the Central Basin Plat-\nform (CBP) as it resides today (pg 3-12, line 20).  The \nCBP is described as \u201ca steeply fault-bounded uplift of \nbasement rocks\u201d (pg 3-12, line 4).  The DEIS also de-\nscribes the steep angle faulting that bounds the plat-\nform\u2019s edges. \nWhile this description is true for the Western flank of \nthe CBP, the NRC fails to disclose the heavily faulted \nnature of the CBP itself in and around the ISP\u2019s pro-\nposed location (see Figure 1 below). \n\n129 \n \nFigure 1.  Image shows highly complex fault network \nwith regional trends through and around the IPS\u2019s site \nlocation.  The west side of the Central Basin Platform \n(CBP) has \u201cgreater structural relief, vertical separa-\ntion, and basement shortening\u201d than the eastern side \n(Tai and Dorobek, 2006).  Approximated WCS location \noutlined by red star. \n\n130 \n \nThe CBP consists of two main crustal blocks arranged \nin an echelon pattern with steeply dipping reverse and \nthrust faults, asymmetrical flower structures, and asso-\nciated normal faults (Tai and Dorobek, 2006).  Once the \nCBP was uplifted during the Mississippian age, the \nboundaries of the CBP began to shear against the plat-\nform edges aligning to the primary stress direction of \nthe Marathon orogeny causing the CBP to rotate in a \nclockwise direction. \nThis rotation of the CBP caused the crustal blocks \nWITHIN the CBP to rotate in a clockwise pattern caus-\ning major deformation and instability within the plat-\nform itself.  Due to the nature of the transpressional \ntectonic setting and the degree of rotation, the western \nside of the CBP has \u201cgreater structural relief, vertical \nseparation, and basement shortening\u201d (Tai and \nDorobek. 2006). \nAll of the evidence for deformation of the subsurface \nlisted above shows that the area of interest is in the \nleast stable region of the CBP from a structural geology \nstandpoint and has undergone more fault reactivation \nin its history than the rest of the CBP. \nSection 3.4.5 Seismology \nThe DEIS then describes the shallow Quaternary faults \nin the area (pg 3-20, line 36).  Quaternary faults are im-\nportant as they, by definition, have shown movement in \nthe last 1.6 million years at the surface (USGS, 2018). \nHowever, most earthquake epicenters in the ISP\u2019s site \nare at depths related to basement faulting (see Figure \n2 below), showing that the risk in this area comes from \nreactivation of basement faults propagating energy felt \nat the surface, not the reactivation of Quaternary age \n\n131 \n \nfaulting.  These Quaternary faults are used as the sole \nbasis for seismic risk stated repeatedly throughout the \nDEIS (pg 4-27, line 8-10 & 39-45) as proximity to a haz-\nard even though they pose less risk to the site and envi-\nronment than the above-mentioned subsurface faults. \nFigure 2.  Image taken from IRIS website showing \nevents in and around area with epicenter magnitudes \n\n132 \n \nand depth of origination.  It can be clearly seen that the \nevents are at estimated depths of 5km (~3.1 mi), show-\ning that the slip/compression events mostly occur at \nbasement depths not within the Quaternary age faults. \nApproximated WCS location outlined by red star. \nA comparison of the earthquake data and CBP fault \nmaps show a correlation of events running through and \naround the ISP proposed CISF site (see Figure 3 be-\nlow). \nFigure 3.  Map comparison of the fault planes within \nthe CBP and public earthquake data from the IRIS \nwebsite.  This figure shows the earthquake epicenters \ntraining to the basement faults in the area of interest \nto WCS and ISP.  This shows that the area continues to \nsettle around these faults even when not in the presence \nof major oil and gas operations, generating accelera-\ntion at the surface.  Approximated WCS location out-\nlined by red star. \nThe omission of the obvious risk posed by these base-\nment faults by the NRC in the DEIS gives cause for \nconcern to the Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis \n\n133 \n \n(PSHA) performed by the ISP applicant and submitted \nto the NRC (pg 3-21, line 3-21). \nISP LLC\u2019s Submitted Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Anal-\nysis (PSHA) \nIssue:  The methodology and limited input require-\nments for PSHA models have been widely discounted \nby scientists and engineers for decades (Mulargia et \nal., 2016) as they include parameters known to contra-\ndict constants in earthquake physics. \nMajor tectonic events have occurred in areas previously \ndeemed \u201clow risk\u201d by PSHA models, because they are \nbased on few known elastic earth properties that are not \nsite specific and therefore cannot create an accurate \nrisk of future earthquakes (San Onofre Safety, un-\nknown).  The following are multiple citations on the dis-\ncreditation of these models and describe the model in-\nputs below. \n\u2022 \nCasta\u00f1os, \nHeriberta, \nand \nCinna \nLomnitz.  \n\u201cPSHA:  Is it science?\u201d  Engineering Geology \n66.3-4 (2002): 315-317. \n\u2022 \nFrankel, Arthur.  \u201cHow can seismic hazard \naround the New Madrid seismic zone be similar \nto that in California?\u201d  Seismological Research \nLetters 75.5 (2004):  575-586.Kl\u00fcgel, Jens-Uwe.  \n\u201cError inflation in probabilistic seismic hazard \nanalysis.\u201d  Engineering Geology 90.3-4 (2007):  \n186-192. \n\u2022 \nMoschetti, Morgan P., et al.  \u201cThe science, engi-\nneering applications, and policy implications of \nsimulation\u2010based PSHA.\u201d  Proceedings of the \n11th National Conference in Earthquake Engi-\nneering (11NCEE), June. 2018. \n\n134 \n \n\u2022 \nMusson, R.

Some of these stations are \u201cpermanent\u201d installa-\ntions while many others are temporary stations that are \nrepeatedly moved and experience issues of effective \nmeasurement through improper coupling to the earth \nand local noise variations. \nEach time a station is moved, the triangulation methods \nused to determine epicenter location and magnitude \nchanges and adds errors to the data that are dependent \non the distance from the epicenter.  These data, as re-\nported in the DEIS, have only been monitored since the \n1970\u2019s (pg 3-20, line 29) and are being used by the ISP \napplicant and the NRC to determine seismic event risks \nup to 100 years into the future (pg 9-16, lines 13-14), or \nover 2 times the length of time that has been monitored. \n\n135 \n \nThe PSHA models are simplified for ease of use and ne-\ngate known physical earth processes such as anisotropic \nvelocity variations that drive the errors found in model \noutputs.  These errors are clearly known by the NRC as \nthey have published internal documents discussing the \nlarge amount of uncertainties in these models, and go \nas far too clearly state that \u201cmany of the problems with \nthese models will not even be thought of as they are so \nlimited in scope\u201d (SSHAC,1997). \nThe DEIS clearly states that the actual damage that re-\nsults from ground motion depends on \u201cdistance to the \nepicenter, duration of shaking, attenuation of earth-\nquake energy as it propagates from the epicenter to the \nlocation  . . .  \u201d  (pg 3-21, line 17), and it is both alarming \nand a deficiency in the analysis that the basement fault \nnetwork around the site was not addressed as a possible \nsource of seismic risk. \nInvestigation into the input parameters included in the \nISP applicant\u2019s PSHA that provided the NRC with a \nLOW risk rating for all geologic hazards was and re-\nmains warranted. \nSurprisingly the only document submitted on the model \nis an affidavit submitted by WCS to the NRC that states \nthat the information provided to the NRC, signed by J. \nScott Kirk (WCS) on 07 MAR 17, was deemed confiden-\ntial under ruling 10 CRF 2.390(a)(4), see attached. \nIt particularly troubling to note that this is the only doc-\nument found that has a request of confidentiality in the \ngeologic section of the ISP\u2019s license application. \nEven if the algorithm for the PSHA model is proprie-\ntary, we as a community should still have access to view \nthe data used to constrain each modeled simulation.  As \n\n136 \n \nno input parameters can be viewed, we must trust the \ndescription of the model provided by the ISP applicant \nwhich states that they \u201cincorporate the site-specific ef-\nfects of the near surface geology on ground motions to \ndesign the ISP site\u201d (pg 3-21, line 5). \nWhat is further disturbing, is that this confidential \nPSHA model, admittedly deficient in its abilities by the \nNRC, is used to determine the strength of materials \nused not only in the cask design but also the site\u2019s foun-\ndational integrity (pg 4-28, lines 19-24).  The PSHA re-\nsults offering the LOW RISK rating are the basis for \nthe impacts outlined in Section 4 of the DEIS, Environ-\nmental Impacts (pg 4-27, lines 39-45) and Section 5, Cu-\nmulative Impacts (pg 5-20, lines 39-40), but are not \nmentioned in Mitigation, Monitoring, or the Summary \nof Environmental Impacts in the EIS.  This means, the \nsite will not be required to have a strategic plan for seis-\nmic monitoring nor a plan in the event that the site un-\ndergoes damage from a seismic surface event. \nIf the site plans are based on a model that the NRC \nknows to be inaccurate, and the NRC states that they \nhave zero authority to force ISP LLC to implement \nstronger safety measures (pg 6-2, lines 21-22) in the \nevent of an earthquake, then the seismic hazard analy-\nsis section of the DEIS should have been investigated \nin more detail by the NRC as the seismically-enhanced \npotential risks to a radiological leak begins to appear as \nnegligence on the NRC\u2019s part. \nThe NRC has the responsibility to require that ISP or \nany future proposed site perform a timely and economic \ncollection of 2D or 3D seismic data to get an accurate \nidea of the tectonic deformation under and around the \nsite\u2019s location. \n\n137 \n \nSection 5 Cumulative Impacts \nSection 5.4 Geology & Soils \nIssue:  Section 5.4 of the DEIS includes discussions (pg \n5-20, lines 37-44; pg 5-21, lines 1-11) analyzing future \nrisk to the site from outside influences such as indus-\ntrial operations on the surface and subsurface oil and \ngas activities, among other concerns.  One major admis-\nsion in this document is the inclusion of a study by \nFrohlich, et al., (2016) that discusses fluid injection and \nhydrocarbon production as driving mechanisms for \nearthquakes recently experienced in the Permian Ba-\nsin. \nEven though there is no consensus between academia, \ngovernment, and industry at this time on the cause of \nthese seismic events, we must still observe and plan on \nany eventuality of earthquake activity due to the high \nlevel radiological hazard of materials being stored at \nthis location and the enormous potential those highly \nhazardous materials have to do damage to the environ-\nment and harm members of the public. \nThe DEIS references the Snee and Zoback (2018) study \nthat is cited (pg 5-21, lines 1-11) as giving a LOW RISK \nevaluation for the site due to future earthquake caused \nby oil and gas operations.  Figure 4 shows very clearly \nthat the fault networks that are used by Snee and Zo-\nback (2018) are surrounded by faults and are in proxim-\nity of some that show a 45% likelihood of slip in the fu-\nture under these conditions. \n\n138 \n \nFigure 4. (Snee and Zoback, 2018) Fault slip potential \nmap identifying areas within the ISP\u2019s site location.  It \nis shown that this model predicts a highly dense fault \nnetwork underneath and around the site, with some \nfaults showing greater than 45% probability of slip in \nthe future.  This model is represented as having a less \nthan 10% chance of activation in the EIS report (EIS, \n5-21, 3-7).  Approximated WCS location outlined by red \nstar. \nIt is hard to see how the ISP applicant declares that the \nsite is at a less than 10% risk of fluid induced fault slip, \nor how the NRC would accept these findings based on \nthe literature that they have cited as the basis for their \nanalytical findings. \n\n139 \n \nWithin this section, the DEIS also describes the risk of \nsinkholes and karst fissure features (dissolved subsur-\nface caverns that collapse under overburden pressure \nchanges) but states that most sinkholes at the surface \nare man-made, resulting from oil and gas operations, \nand that the naturally occurring karsts are prominent \nalong the flanks of the CBP and the Delaware Basin (pg \n5-21, lines 12-18), inferring that there is no real risk to \nthe site.  This again is a very misleading argument as \nthe karst/collapse features presented are those that \nhave already affected the surface through subsidence. \nThe most significant risk, once again, lies beneath the \nISP\u2019s proposed site location. \nThe Ellenberger formation is a major deposition that \nconstitutes a large portion of Ordovician rock present \nunderneath the proposed site.  This formation is of in-\nterest to this site as it has been subjected to three major \ndiagenetic processes that change the stability and na-\nture of the formation:  1) Dolomitization, 2) Karsting, \nand 3) Tectonic fracturing. \nThese diagenetic processes all create further instabili-\nties in the subsurface in the event of a seismic event or \nregional shift in stresses, and have been studied exten-\nsively by the Bureau of Economic Geology (Loucks, \n2014) and other institutions of which neither the ISP ap-\nplicant nor the NRC have consulted on this matter ac-\ncording to the DEIS report.  Whether or not these \nevents are caused by industrial activities, or whether \nthey follow the natural stress regimes as described in \nthe geologic overview of the CBP; it is clear that the \nNRC has not fully investigated the dangers and risks of \nsurface collapse due to diagenetic processes. \n \n \n\n140 \n \nFinal discussion on Seismic Concerns: \nThe ISP applicant and the NRC are in clear violation of \n10 CFR 72.122(b)(2)(i)(A), for their failure to consider \nin their protections against environmental conditions \nand natural phenomena the \u201cmost severe of the natural \nphenomena for this site and surrounding area, with ap-\npropriate margins to take into account the limitations of \nthe data and the period of time in which the data have \naccumulated  . . .  \u201d  The regulation further requires in \n(3) \u201cCapability must be provided for determining the in-\ntensity of natural phenomena that may occur for com-\nparison with design bases of structures, systems, and \ncomponents important to safety.\u201d  The DEIS fails to \nmeet these requirements. \nOther commenters (including below) have opined to the \nNRC on the matter of chloride-induced stress corrosion \ncracking (proposed site located next to a KCL(3)  \nPOTASH mine), thin cask design failures, and heat in-\nduced stress failures.  How much of a seismic force \nwould need to be generated/registered at the site to ac-\ncelerate an undetected crack growing into a leak?  \nThere is no evidence in the DEIS that this scenario has \nbeen analyzed. \nThe DEIS also states that \u201cfavorable seismological and \ngeological characteristics\u201d are one of the first-tier at-\ntributes that they look for in determining a suitable site \nlocation (pg 2-24, line 17).  This proves that this issue is \none of the most important considerations in the licens-\ning of a CISF to ensure safe operations before construc-\ntion begins, which causes alarm due to the lack of inves-\ntigation into this concern. \nIt is also disappointing that the NRC only consulted \nwith the US DOA and the TCEQ (pg 1-12, lines 3-11), \n\n141 \n \nneither agencies having any jurisdiction in the lower \nrock formations that are undergoing and have experi-\nenced the most tectonic deformation over time, thus \nmore likely to create a seismic energy release.  The \nTexas Bureau of Economic Geology is the Texas agency \nwith the required expertise and must be consulted on \nthese matters. \nMany public institutions have extensive knowledge of \nthe fault networks within the Permian Basin that work \nfreely with governmental agencies on a regular basis.  \nThe NRC acknowledges that it has zero authority to im-\npose mitigation outside of its regulatory authority un-\nder the Atomic Energy Act (pg 6-2, lines 21-22), and in-\ncludes mitigation suggestions from ISP and for ISP to \nfollow outlined in DEIS Tables 6.3-1 and 6.3-2.  Neither \nof these mitigations discuss the need for further seismic \nmonitoring onsite or future plans to change the sites in-\nfrastructure if additional higher magnitude events \nreach the site.  This again shows a highly misplaced \ntrust in the PSHA model authored, made proprietary, \nand submitted by the ISP applicant (formerly WCS) \nthat industry has shown to be flawed. \nIt is for these reasons it is recommended that a \u201cNo Ac-\ntion\u201d policy be taken, and the ISP license should be \npostponed or denied until a wide azimuth seismic survey \nhas been conducted to understand the nature of the de-\nformation under the proposed site location. \nCitations in main body: \nCornell, C.

The DEIS fails to mention and characterize the \nRGR, which is critical in understanding the geological \nand geohydrological history of the aquifers at the CISF.  \nThe RGR began in the Middle Cenozoic (29 Million \nyears ago) and continues to present day (Mack and \nGiles, 2004).  The RGR was caused by crustal extension.  \nThis extension structurally tilted the Permian Basin up \nto the east which caused massive meteoric water move-\nment.  This structural tilting emplaced and recharged \nthe regional aquifers (Lindsay, 2018).  The RGR is not \ndormant but active, from Colorado\u2019s central Rocky \nMountains to Mexico (Sheehan, 2012). \nMack, G.H. and Giles, K.A., 2004, The Geology of New \nMexico:  A Geologic History:  New Mexico Geological \nSociety Special Publication 11. 474 p.  \nLindsay, R.F., 2018, Hybrid Model of Dolomitization, \nPermian Basin:  AAPG 2018 Convention & Exhibition. \nSheehan, Anne, 2012, Some earthquakes expected along \nRio Grande Rift in Colorado and New Mexico, new \nstudy say:  CU Boulder Today.  https://www.colorado.edu/ \ntoday/2012/01/11/some-earthquakes-expected-along-rio-\ngrande-rift-colorado-and-new-mexico-new-study-says \nGroundwater Resources \nIssue:  In Table 5.1-1, the DEIS insufficiently and inap-\npropriately projects small, cumulative impacts to \ngroundwater resources. \nGeologic, environmental, and mechanical data show \ngroundwater at and beneath the CISF footprint.  There \nare 3 major aquifers at the WCS site that contain shal-\nlow, fresh, groundwater.  These 3 major aquifers are re-\n\n144 \n \nferred to as the OAG Unit (Granger and Grisak, 2006).  \nThe OAG unit consists of the Ogallala, Antler, and \nGatuna formations. \nThese formations are in similar stratigraphic position, \nare often interbedded, and cross formational flow is \nknown to exist between the Antler and Ogallala \n(Granger and Grisak, 2006; Lehman and Rainwater, \n2000).  These units also overlie the Dockum Group, an \nadditional aquifer at the site. \nSignificant groundwater resources are present within \nthe CISF footprint.  There are 13 windmills and 174 wa-\nter wells that have been drilled within a 10 km radius of \nthe site, many of which produce groundwater at depths \nof less than 100 feet (Granger and Grisak, 2006).  Fresh \ngroundwater from these windmills and water wells are \nused for domestic potable water, stock, irrigation, and \ncommercial purposes. \nFresh groundwater flows out of the Gatuna aquifer at \nBaker Spring, near the site (Lehman and Rainwater, \n2000).  The Antler formation is exposed within the walls \nof the WCS excavation pit (Granger and Grisak, 2006; \nLehman and Rainwater, 2000).  Ponded water is present \nin the base of the pit, as seen from google earth images \nand could be from groundwater seepage from the Ant-\nler and the Dockum aquifers. \nThe Dockum aquifer is also present at the WCS site and \nis an extremely widespread aquifer containing 1000\u2019s of \nacre-feet of water and found in 46 Texas counties (Mace \nand Petrossian, 2011).  It is considered a minor aquifer \nby TWDB because of elevated total dissolved solid \n(TDS) levels. \n\n145 \n \nAt the WCS site and throughout Andrews County the \nTDS measurements are near 1000 ppm, which is slightly \nbrackish.  The Santa Rosa sandstone within the Dock-\num Group is a significant aquifer in west Texas and is \nused extensively for agriculture and oil and gas opera-\ntions.  Groundwater from the Dockum is also being \ntreated by reverse osmosis methods throughout the \narea and used as fresh water.  These aquifers should be \nprotected from any contamination, especially radionu-\nclides. \nSignificant oil and gas activity surround the CISF foot-\nprint.  There are approximately 4,579 wellbores within \na 10-mile radius of the CISF, 1,066 wellbores drilled and \nplugged prior to 1967.  Current plugging procedures en-\nsure protection of contamination to groundwater re-\nsources, but wells plugged and abandoned prior to 1967, \npose potential risk of contamination.  These old aban-\ndoned wellbores could be conduits of contamination if \nthere were radionuclide spills at the surface. \nThe CISF footprint lies in the center of the Permian Ba-\nsin.  This basin contains billions of barrels of hydrocar-\nbons and millions of acre-feet of groundwater.  The Per-\nmian Basin is the largest and most important hydrocar-\nbon producing basin in the United States. \nThe Permian Basin produces 50% of domestic hydrocar-\nbons and 5% of global oil (EIA, 2020).  These hydrocar-\nbon and groundwater resources ensure domestic en-\nergy needs and global security.  High level nuclear \nwaste should not be disposed of in the most important \nhydrocarbon basin in the country. \nGranger, D., Grisak, G., 2006, Appendix 2.6.1, Geology \nReport:  Prepared for Waste Control Specialists, LLC.:  \nCook-Joyce Inc., 219 p.  \n\n146 \n \nLehman, T.M., Rainwater, K., 2000, Geology of the \nWCS\u2014Flying \u201cW\u201d Ranch, Andrews County, Texas:  \nTexas Tech University Water Resources Center.  81 p. \nGeorge, P.G., Mace, R.E., Petrossian, R., 2011, Aquifers \nof Texas:  Texas Water Development Board Report 380, \n172 p. \nEIA, 2020, Permian Region: Drilling Productivity Re-\nport. \nhttps://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/permian.pdf \nHealth Physics & Nuclear Safety \nIn the Interim Storage Partners, LLC (ISP) DEIS, the \nNRC fails to comply with its legal obligations to conduct \na thorough and complete analysis of the environmental \nimpacts of the proposed CISF, specifically as evidenced \nby the following: \n1.  Failure to Analyze Major Points of View.  Pur-\nsuant to 10 CFR 51.71, the DEIS is required to \n\u201canalyze major points of view, and to the extent \nsufficient information is available\u201d, the DEIS is \nrequired to \u201cconsider major points of view con-\ncerning the environmental impacts of the pro-\nposed action\u201d and \u201ccontain an analysis of signifi-\ncant problems raised\u201d by other Federal agencies.  \nYet, nowhere in the 484-pages of the ISP DEIS is \nthe significant concern of chloride-induced stress \ncorrosion cracking (CISCC) mentioned or ana-\nlyzed in terms of the severe environmental im-\npact that could result from this \u201csignificant prob-\nlem\u201d raised by both the NRC and the Department \nof Energy (DOE). \nBeginning in November of 2012, the NRC noti-\nfied its 10 CFR 72 licensees and certificate of \n\n147 \n \ncompliance holders that the problem of CISCC \nwas a \u201chigh priority data gap\u201d and was only just \nbeing recognized.  Additionally, researchers did \nnot \u201c  . . .  yet fully understand the relationship \nbetween the proximity to a salt-water body and \nthe potential for chloride deposition on a dry cask \nstorage system canister.  However, it should be \nnoted that many ISFSIs are located near salt- \nwater bodies or other sources of chlorides, such as \nsalted roads or condensed cooling tower water.\u201d1  \n(emphasis added) \n2.  Failure to Address Status of Compliance.  The \nNRC (2012) continued to identify impacts to the \n\u201cstatus of compliance\u201d2 that a failure of the con-\nfinement systems would have and the violations \nof federal regulations (and licenses and COCs) \nthat would occur, including violations of 10 CFR \n72.120(d), 72.122(b)(1), 72.122(h)(1), 72.122(h)(4), \n72.122(l), 72.236(d), and 72.236(l), should the \u201csig-\nnificant problem\u201d of CISCC result in a failure of \na dry storage canister (DSC) and subsequent un-\ncontained release to the environment.  However, \ndespite the requirement to address potential im-\npacts to status of compliance for known, signifi-\ncant problems documented completely within its \nown regulatory system, the NRC fails to comply \nwith the requirements of the statute in the ISP \nDEIS. \n \n1 NRC Information Notice 2012\u201020, Potential Chloride\u2010Induced \nStress Corrosion Cracking of Austenitic Stainless Steel and \nMaintenance of Dry Cask Storage System Canisters, November \n14, 2012, ML12319A440 \n2 10 CFR 51.71(c) \n\n148 \n \n3.  Failure to Analyze Effects of a CISCC-Induced \nRelease on the Public and the Environment.  As \na result of ignoring the imminent environmental \nimpacts from the DSC failure caused by CISCC, \nthe NRC ultimately fails to analyze the most sig-\nnificant threat to the public and the environment \nwithin the context of the proposed licensed activ-\nity and therefore fails to comply with 10 CFR \n51.71(d).  In failing to perform this analysis, the \nNRC also fails to assess the economic costs such \na radioactive release would bring to the region \nand to the country as a whole, as well as impacts \nto the nuclear industry in particular from a public \nloss of confidence in the safety of these unmoni-\ntored SNF storage systems placed in vulnerable \ncommunities throughout the country. \n4.  Failure to Address Policy Implications.  The \nDEIS also fails to address the policy implications \nthat the proposed ISP facility has been proposed \nto serve, in the NRC\u2019s own words as a Monitored \nRetrievable Storage (MRS) Facility\u2014not an \nISFSI\u2014as described both in 10 CFR 72 and in \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \nISP DEIS \n\u201cPURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE PRO-\nPOSED ACTION \n\u201cThe purpose of the proposed ISP CISF is to \nprovide an option for storing SNF, GTCC, and \na small quantity of MOX from nuclear power \nreactors before a permanent repository is avail-\nable.  These waste materials would be received \nfrom operating, decommissioning, and decom-\nmissioned reactor facilities.\u201d  (DEIS, Execu-\n\n149 \n \ntive Summary, page xviii, lines 14-18 and \u00a7 1.3, \npg 1-3, Lines 26-30) (emphasis added) \n10 CFR 72.3 \n\u201cMonitored Retrievable Storage Installation \nor MRS means a complex designed, construc-\nted, and operated by DOE for the receipt, \ntransfer, handling, packaging, possession, \nsafeguarding, and storage of spent nuclear fuel \naged for at least one year, solidified high-level \nradioactive waste resulting from civilian nu-\nclear activities, and solid reactor-related \nGTCC waste, pending shipment to a HLW re-\npository or other disposal.\u201d  (emphasis added)  \n \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 10161(b)(1) \n\u201c1) On or before June 1, 1985, the Secretary \nshall complete a detailed study of the need for \nand feasibility of, and shall submit to the Con-\ngress a proposal for, the construction of one or \nmore monitored retrievable storage facilities \nfor high-level radioactive waste and spent  \nnuclear fuel.  Each such facility shall be \ndesigned\u2014 \n\u201c(A) to accommodate spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste resulting from \ncivilian nuclear activities; \n\u201c(B) to permit continuous monitoring, man-\nagement, and maintenance of such spent \nfuel and waste for the foreseeable future; \n\u201c(C) to provide for the ready retrieval of \nsuch spent fuel and waste for further pro-\ncessing or disposal; and \n\n150 \n \n\u201c(D) to safely store such spent fuel and \nwaste as long as may be necessary by main-\ntaining such facility through appropriate \nmeans, including any required replacement \nof such facility.\u201d \nDespite the NRC\u2019s strenuous attempt to \u201cre-\nbrand\u201d from the MRS description in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act to a simple 10 CFR Part 72 \n\u201cAway from Reactor\u201d (AFR) ISFSI, by ignoring \nthe impacts of the violation of obligations under \nthe NWPA, the NRC is allowing the licensing of \na facility woefully inadequate to address the \nlong-lasting concerns associated with CISCC \nand the need to have hot cells present to repack-\nage SNF whose canisters can no longer perform \ntheir designed and licensed confinement function \ndue to CISCC.3 \n5.  Failure to Address the Impacts of the Geology \nand Soils on the CISF Operations.  Section 4.4 of \nthe DEIS fails to evaluate the most grave and sig-\nnificant hazard acknowledged by the NRC of \nsalts present in the soils surrounding the pro-\nposed ISP site.  This is a direct violation of 10 \nCFR 72.122(b)(2) where \u201c[s]tructures, systems, \nand components important to safety\u201d have not \nbeen designed to withstand the effects of natural \nphenomena and the design bases for these struc-\ntures, systems, and components do not include \n\u201c[a]ppropriate consideration of the most severe \nof the natural phenomena reported for the site \nand surrounding area, with appropriate margins \n \n3 Blue Ribbon Commission on America\u2019s Nuclear Future,  \n\u00a7 5.2.6, pg. 39, January 2012 \n\n151 \n \nto take into account the limitations of the data \nand the period of time in which the data have ac-\ncumulated,\u201d or \u201c[a]ppropriate combinations of \nthe effects of normal and accident conditions and \nthe effects of natural phenomena.\u201d \nThe significant detrimental effects of naturally \noccurring materials and meteorological phenom-\nena on the integrity of the SNF confinement bar-\nriers have been repeatedly acknowledged by the \nNRC, DOE, NWTRB and the GAO since the \nNRC first information notice in the topic in 2012.  \nThe specific cause of the \u201chigh priority data gaps\u201d \nis the phenomenon of CISCC. \nChloride-Induced Stress Corrosion Cracking \n(CISCC)  \nThe phenomenon of CISCC obviously requires \nchloride bearing salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCL, etc.) to \nbe present as an initial condition.  The initial con-\ndition is more than met with the proposed ISP \nCISF being sited in the midst of the massive Sa-\nlado (\u201cSalt\u201d) Formation: \n\u201cSALADO FORMATION \n\u201cThe Salado formation, unlike the Castile for-\nmation, is not confined to the Delaware basin but \nextends more than 100 miles north and 100 miles \neast of the basin and underlies an area of about \n25,000 square miles. \n\u201cThe Salado formation consists of salt, anhydrite, \nand potassium salts with varying amounts of clas-\ntic material.  Salt comprises about 75 to 90 per-\ncent of the formation except in areas where sub-\nsurface solution has removed much of it, and to-\n\n152 \n \nward the depositional edges of the formation \nwhere variegated mudstone predominates (Ma-\nley and Huffington, 1953).  The next most abun-\ndant constituent in the formation is anhydrite.  \nThe remainder of the formation consists of sand-\nstone, siltstone, shale, polyhalite, and numerous \nless abundant potassium minerals. \n\u201cThe most abundant potassium minerals in the for-\nmation are polyhalite (K2SO4-MgSO4-2CaSO4-\n2H2O), sylvite (KCl), langbeinite (K2SO4-\n2MgS04), carnallite (KCl-MgC12-6H20), kainite \n(KCl-MgS04-3H20), and leonite (K2S04-MgS04-\n4H2O).  Of these minerals polyhalite is the most \nabundant and widespread  . . .  \u201d4 \n \n \n \n4 Geological Survey Bulletin 1148, \u201cSummary of Rock Salt De-\nposits in the United States as Possible Storage Sites for Radioac-\ntive Waste Materials,\u201d US Department of the Interior (DOI), 1962 \n\n153 \n \nFigure 5.

Mex. (Richardson, 1904, p. \n61-64; King, 1948, p. 160-162).  . . .  These deposits are \nin or near existing salt lakes.  It is not known whether \nthe salt is introduced into the waters of the lakes as a \ndissolved constituent in surface water or by the perco-\nlation of ground water from deeply buried salt beds.\u201d5  \n[emphasis added] \nFigure 6.

Salt Lakes & Playas Near ISP, East \nWhile this readily available source term of the material \nrequired to initiate CISCC is present in enormous \nquantities, the NRC makes no connection to its signifi-\ncant, publicly stated concerns that sources of chlorides \n(and something as simple as \u201csalted roads\u201d) should be \nevaluated as sources potentially triggering CISCC and \nresulting in DSC confinement failures of \u201cengineering \nsignificance\u201d (i.e., DSC breach and environmental re-\nlease).6 \nHow are surface salt deposits in the immediate vicinity \nof the proposed ISP facility a threat to the SNF storage \noperations?

Haboob. Midland, TX. \nWhile the NRC has located several individual SNF \nDSCs across the US that have surface deposits of salt \nin sufficient quantities to initiate CISCC, the NRC is \nproposing to move the entire inventory of SNF DSCs to \na region of the country where ALL DSCs would be ex-\nposed to salt deposition for extended periods with no \nmeans to inspect or repair the canisters should a leak \noccur, and no means to detect a leak at its source should \none occur. \nIn the 8 years since the issuance of its initial Infor-\nmation Notice regarding the concern of CISCC and its \nunknown extent within the existing national SNF inven-\ntory, the NRC, the DOE, the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board, and the nuclear industry\u2019s Nuclear En-\nergy Institute have invested tens of millions of dollars \n\n158 \n \ninto the study and characterization of the magnitude of \nthe hazard affecting SNF DSCs as it relates to CISCC \nand\u2014more importantly\u2014how to even inspect loaded \nSNF DSC canisters (in the presence of lethal radiation \nfields) or detect a breaching canister or what can be \ndone with a failed canister when and if it can be identi-\nfied. \nTo date, neither the magnitude of the hazard, the man-\nner in which CISCC propagates and under what condi-\ntions, nor the extent of its presence on the current in-\nstalled inventory of over 2,000 DSCs throughout the \ncountry is fully understood to allow an adequate safety \nbasis to be developed and constitute a viable license \n\n159 \n \nwith controls adequate to protect the public and the en-\nvironment.8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \n \n8 SAND2015\u20107068 R, \u201cStatus Report:  Characterization of Weld \nResidual Stresses on a Full\u2010Diameter SNF Interim Storage Can-\nister Mockup,\u201d August 21, 2015.  \u201cThe potential for stress corro-\nsion cracking (SCC) of welded stainless steel interim storage con-\ntainers for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been identified as a high \npriority data gap by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \n(NWTRB), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the De-\npartment of Energy (DOE) Fuel Cycle Research and Development \n(FCRD) programs Used Fuel Disposition (UFD) campaign (Han-\nson et al, 2012), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC \n2012a; 2012b).  Uncertainties exist both in the understanding of \nthe environmental conditions on the surface of the storage canis-\nters and in the textural, microstructural, and electrochemical \nproperties of the storage containers themselves.  The canister sur-\nface environment is currently being evaluated by Sandia and \nEPRI; however, little has been done to assess canister material prop-\nerties and their impact on corrosion.  Of specific interest are weld \nzones on the canisters, because the welding process modifies the mi-\ncrostructure of the stainless steel as well as its resistance to localized  \ncorrosion.  In addition, welding introduces high tensile residual \nstresses that can drive the initiation and growth of SCC cracks.\u201d \n9 SAND2015\u20108668C, \u201cUnderstanding the Risk of Chloride In-\nduced Stress Corrosion Cracking of Interim Storage Containers \nfor the Dry Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel:  Residual Stresses in \nTypical Welded Containers,\u201d October 2015. \n10 NWTRB\u20102017, \u201cChloride\u2010Induced Stress Corrosion Cracking \nPotential in Dry Storage Canisters for Spent Nuclear Fuel,\u201d U.S. \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board, March 01, 2017 \n11 SAND2017\u20102584PE, \u201cEvaluating Stress Corrosion Cracking \nof Spent Nuclear Fuel Interim Storage Canisters,\u201d Charles Bryan, \nSandia National Laboratories, Used Fuel Disposition Program, \nColorado School of Mines, Presentation to DOE Fuel Cycle Tech-\nnologies Meeting, March 9, 2017 \n12 IHLRWM 2017, \u201cSpent Fuel Dry Storage Aging Manage-\nment:  Development of the Managing Aging Processes in Storage \n(Maps) Report,\u201d USNRC, et al, April 9, 2017 \n\n160 \n \nAs recently as December 2019, 16 the DOE and NRC \npublished revised research priorities that clearly show \nwhat is being learned in regard to CISCC and what ur-\ngent actions those findings are driving: \n\u2022 Welded Canister Corrosion (Priority 1)\u2014This was \nmoved from Priority 3 to Priority 1. \n \n\u201cThree main parameters have been shown to affect \nstress corrosion cracking (SCC):  environment (salt \ncontent, salt stability, humidity, and temperature); \nmaterial (stainless steel(SS)304/304L is used in dry \nstorage canisters); and loading (high tensile stresses \nin weld zones could support through-wall SCC).

Table ES-1 from SAND2019-15479R \n\u2022 Consequence of Canister Failure (Priority 3)\u2014This \nwas not even on the list of priorities as late as 2018. \n \n\u201cThe focus is to develop [sic] technically defensible \nassessment of gaseous and particulate releases and \nradiological consequences through SCC breaches.\u201d \n \nNow that the probability of canister failure is \ndeemed likely, the absence of a realistic assessment \nof the consequences of DSC failure is now a \u201cHigh \nPriority Gap\u201d for the NRC and DOE, but is inexpli-\ncably absent from the ISP DEIS, in violation of 10 \nCFR 51.71(d). \n\u2022 Fuel Transfer Options (Priority 3)\u2014This initiative \nhas increased in priority given the likelihood that \nCISCC will lead to DSC breach and failure. \n \n\u201cData is [sic] needed to support facility design con-\ncept for opening a cask for inspection and transfer/ \nrepackaging.\u201d \n \nAs noted supra, there is no capability at the pro-\nposed ISP CISF to transfer or repackage SNF from \n\n163 \n \na failed and leaking DSC.  In fact, the Holtec CEO \nmade the following statements on this topic in an Oc-\ntober 14, 2014 address to the Edison Community En-\ngagement Panel17: \n\u201cIf that canister were to develop a leak, let\u2019s be real-\nistic, you have to find it, that crack, where it might \nbe, and then find the means to repair it.\u201d \n\u201cYou will have, in the face of millions of curies of ra-\ndioactivity coming out of the canister  . . .  we think \nit\u2019s not a path forward  . . .  \u201d \n\u201cA canister that develops a microscopic crack  . . .  \nall it takes is a microscopic crack to get the release  \n. . .  to locate it  . . .  \u201d \n\u201cAnd then if you try to repair it  . . .  remotely by \nwelding  . . .  the problem with that is that you cre-\nate a rough surface which becomes a new creation \nsite for corrosion down the road.\u201d \n\u201cASME Section 3, Class 1 has some very significant \nrequirements for making repairs of Class 1 struc-\ntures like the canisters  . . .  \u201d \n\u201cSo I, as a pragmatic technical solution, I don\u2019t advo-\ncate repairing the canister.\u201d \nA DSC loaded with SNF presents a lethal radiation \nenvironment that requires a multi-million-dollar hot \ncell facility to attempt to remotely/robotically repair \nor repackage the SNF from a leaking DSC to an in-\ntact DSC.  Dried SNF cannot be reinserted into a \nspent fuel pool due to the thermal shocks caused by \n \n17 https://youtu.be/euaFZt0YPi4 \n\n164 \n \n\u201crewetting.\u201d  As such, the only option is to use a hot \ncell for a fuel transfer. \nHowever, no such hot cell will be constructed at the \nISP CISF, and therefore the only option would be to \nplace an actively-leaking DSC into a transportation \ncask, \u201cin the face of millions of curies,\u201d as described \nby the Holtec CEO, \u201cof radioactivity coming out of \nthe canister.\u201d  The leak would have to first be de-\ntected, then the extraction process that would take \nhours or days would proceed as the active release \nwas taking place and continuing to harm the work-\ners, the public and the environment. \nWhile within the transportation cask, there is (1) no \ncurrent understanding as to how the now leaking \nspent fuel would behave in this unanalyzed environ-\nment or (2) how long it could be safely contained or \n(3) how a transportation cask could be moved or \ntransported while holding a leaking DSC that vio-\nlates its certification requirements.  These are sig-\nnificant matters of operations and transportation \nwith attendant impacts to the workers, the public \nand the environment that have not been analyzed. \nThe absence of any capability to safely contain a \nleaking DSC before it creates massive harm to the \npublic and environment is a significant flaw in the \nISP DEIS analysis and a violation of 10 CFR \n51.71(d).  This \u201chigh priority data gap\u201d fully acknowl-\nedged by the NRC and DOE in public reports is a \n\u201cmajor point of view\u201d that must be addressed to meet \nthe requirements of US law.  It\u2019s absence in the ISP \nDEIS is unacceptable. \nBased on the failure of the NRC to address the real and \nacknowledged threats to the public and the environ-\n\n165 \n \nment from CISCC, the following NRC conclusions are \nwithout basis and provably false: \n\u201cOverall, based on the preceding analysis that considers \n(i) occupational dose estimates for operations that are \nbelow applicable NRC standards, (ii) public dose esti-\nmates from CISF storage operations that are well be-\nlow NRC standards and a small fraction of background \nradiation exposure, and (iii) low occupational injury es-\ntimates, the NRC staff concludes that the radiological \nand nonradiological public and occupational health im-\npacts from the operations stage of the proposed action \n(Phase 1) and full build-out (Phases 1-8) would be \nSMALL.\u201d  (DEIS, \u00a7 4.13.1.2, pg 4-86, lines 26-31)   \nIn fact, the NRC cannot perform a legally-compliant as-\nsessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed \nISP CISF, nor can it issue a license with sufficient con-\ntrols protective of the public and the environment when \nthe significant \u201chigh priority data gaps\u201d remain regard-\ning a full understanding of the magnitude of the prob-\nlems presented by CISCC, especially when \u201ccompletely \nsurrounded by\u201d the chloride-bearing salts that are re-\nquired to initiate a DSC breach. \nAs freely acknowledged by the NRC, the materials re-\nquired to initiate CISCC are present in abundant quan-\ntities.  Historic weather patterns demonstrate that me-\nteorological events (windstorms, sandstorms, haboobs, \nrain, mist and fog) occur with sufficient frequency and \nintensity to deliver the chloride-bearing materials to \ncanister surfaces and initiate attacks on the stainless \nsteel DCSs. \nAs evidenced by this exchange during a 2018 NRC Com-\nmission meeting, it appears that the NRC is taking the \npath of allowing the industry to dictate what operation \n\n166 \n \nis or is not considered \u201csafe\u201d or which \u201cengineered bar-\nrier failures\u201d caused by environmental forces of salt and \nwater vapor are deemed credible: \nCOMMISSIONER WRIGHT:  \u201c  . . .  And I\u2019ve got \none last question, and I\u2019m going down to Christian.  \nSo I appreciate the discussion on research into the \npotential aging relating degradation mechanisms for \nthe fuel cask.  It\u2019s my understanding that industry\u2019s \nexploring several repair and mitigation techniques, \nyou know, as well as the use of robotics for inspec-\ntion.  To what extent have you engaged the industry \nin these matters, and what\u2019s been the outcome of \nthat?\u201d \nMR. ARAGUAS:  \u201cSo thank you for that question.  \nSo what I can tell you is we\u2019ve been engaged with the \nindustry, specifically with EPRI, through their \nESCP program, this is extended storage and collab-\norative programs.  And under that program they \nhave a number of subcommittees, one of which talks \nabout aging management and NDE techniques.  And \nthey\u2019ve been in front of trying to develop techniques \nto be able to inspect, you know, casks in service.  So \nwe\u2019ve been plugged into that, I think in lockstep with \nthe industry to develop understanding how they\u2019re \nprogressing in those initiatives. \n\u201cSeparately, we do have a contract with PNNL, one \nof the DOE laboratories, to set up a mockup of a cask \nto collaborate with EPRI to actually see how the ro-\nbotics, how these tools are resulting in the inspec-\ntions to actually assess and see, can they detect the \nflaws, can they understand and characterize the \nflaws. \n\n167 \n \n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s progressing well, I think we have con-\nfidence in the industry and the direction they\u2019re going \nto be able to inspect these in the future.\u201d18  (emphases \nadded) \nIt should be stated that the Federal Aviation Admin-\nistration also had \u201cconfidence in Boeing\u201d to carry out \nthe critical independent verification measures that de-\nfines the role of an independent regulator.  That mis-\nplaced confidence ended tragically for 692 souls. \nPretending that the environment will not adversely im-\npact the function of the SNF DSC confinement barriers \nignores the repeated and publicly stated significant con-\ncerns represented in thousands of pages of documents \nand millions dollars invested by the NRC and DOE to \nsolve the very real problem of CISCC, and creates an \nunacceptable analytical deficiency in the ISP DEIS. \n \n \n \n18 NRC Meeting Transcript:  \u201cStrategic Programmatic Overview \nof The Decommissioning and Low\u2010Level Waste and Spent Fuel \nStorage and Transportation Business Lines,\u201d October 11, 2018, \nML18295A698. \n\n168 \n \nAttachment: \nWCS/ISP 10 CRF 2.390(a)(4) Affidavit Regarding  \nProprietary Content in PSHA \n \n\n169 \n \nFrom: \nMcDill, Teresa, NMENV <Teresa. \nMcDill@state.nm.us> \nSent:  \nTuesday, November 3, 2020 4:10 \nPM \nTo:  \nWCS_CISFEIS Resource \nSubject:  \n[External_Sender] Comments on \nDocket ID NRC-2016-0231 \nAttachments:  \n2020-11-03\u2014OOTS NEPA Review \nInterim Storage Partners (Fi-\nnal).pdf \nGood Afternoon, \nPlease see New Mexico Environment Department\u2019s at-\ntached comments on draft Environmental Impact \nStatement for Interim Storage Partners\u2019 application for \na license to construct and operate a consolidated spent \nnuclear fuel storage facility in Andrews County, Texas. \nThank you, \nTerry \nTeresa L.

KENNEY \nJAMES C. KENNEY \nCabinet Secretary \nEnvironment Department \nAttachment (1) \ncc: \nCourtney Kerster, Director of Federal Affairs,  \nOffice of Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham \n \nSara Cottrell Propst, Cabinet Secretary, Energy \nMinerals and Natural Resources Department \n \nSandra Ely, Director, NMED Environmental Pro-\ntection Division \n \nRebecca Roose, Director, NMED Water Protec-\ntion Division \n \nStephane Stringer, Director, NMED Resource \nProtection Division \n \n \n\n173 \n \nComments \nIntroduction \nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) pro-\nposes approval of the Interim Storage Partners, LLC \n(ISP) license application to construct and operate a con-\nsolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for spent nu-\nclear fuel (SNF) and Greater-Than-Class C waste and \nspent mixed oxide fuel at the existing Waste Control \nSpecialists (WCS) site in Andrews County, Texas, very \nclose to the New Mexico state line.  The NRC proffers \na draft environmental impact statement (EIS)1 to sup-\nport the proposed action, which would authorize storage \nof up to 5,000 metric tons of uranium (MTUs) for a li-\ncense period of 40 years.  The ISP admits it will seek \namendments and extensions of the license to store an \nadditional 5,000 MTUs for each of seven expansion \nphases over 20 years, resulting in an expanded facility \nwith total storage of up to 40,000 MTUs of SNF.  New \nMexico opposes the proposed action as the EIS is sig-\nnificantly flawed, and the proposed action presents \nthreats to the health and environment of New Mexico \nand its citizens. \nThe New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) \nhas considerable experience and interaction with the \nWCS facility, due to its location along the Texas-New \nMexico border, and is familiar with the operations and \nenvironmental issues of this site.  Furthermore, prevail-\ning wind direction is generally from the proposed site \ntowards New Mexico, groundwater flow beneath the ex-\nisting waste cells at the site is predominantly to the \n \n1 EIS download:  https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2012/ML20122A \n220.pdf. \n\n174 \n \nsouthwest towards New Mexico, and surface water flow \nfrom the site is directed through outfalls that flow di-\nrectly into New Mexico. \nContaminants released to air and water at the ISP site, \ntherefore, have the potential to migrate into New Mex-\nico and create threats to human health and the environ-\nment.  As a result of the potential for existing opera-\ntions at the WCS site to affect groundwater quality in \nNew Mexico, NMED required WCS to obtain a Ground-\nwater Discharge Permit (DP-1817) for WCS\u2019s waste \ndisposal operations in Texas.  WCS submits groundwa-\nter monitoring reports to NMED as required by DP-\n1817 and is currently in compliance with DP-1817. \nOverall, the technical analysis in the draft EIS is inad-\nequate and does not support the proposed alternative.  \nThe EIS fails to properly characterize the site, which is \ngeologically unsuitable.  Similarly, the numerous tech-\nnical site deficiencies preclude thorough evaluation of \nthe site or the proposed project.  Furthermore, the \ndraft EIS lacks all applicable state regulatory oversight \nand environmental impact controls.  Additionally, the \ndraft EIS omits a full assessment of environmental jus-\ntice concerns or analysis of the effects of the proposed \nproject.  These deficiencies all contribute to a draft EIS \nthat fails to meet the requirements of Section 102(2)(c) \nof the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  \nNew Mexico disagrees strongly with the recommended \naction of approving the Interim Storage Partners \nLLC\u2019s License and recommends the No Action Alterna-\ntive. \n \n \n\n175 \n \n1. \nMoving SNF multiple times creates unnecessary \nrisks to public health, safety, and the environment. \nThe NRC stated in its Waste Confidence Decision2 that \nSNF can be stored safely beyond the operating life of a \npower reactor, at current locations, until a national re-\npository for SNF is established.  Moreover, states and \nregional groups have consistently supported moving \nfuel only once\u2014from current locations to a national re-\npository.  As this project proposes a temporary solution \nto a permanent problem, the SNF of concern may need \nto be moved multiple times until a permanent solution \nis established.  Ultimately, moving SNF multiple times \nincreases the likelihood of accidents within the State of \nNew Mexico and elsewhere. \n2. \nThe proposed ISP CISF site is geologically unsuita-\nble. \nGiven that a permanent repository for high-level radio-\nactive waste does not exist in the United States and \nthere is no existing plan to build one, any \u201cinterim\u201d stor-\nage facility will be an indefinite storage facility, includ-\ning ISP\u2019s CISF.  The license life for the application ISP \nsubmitted to the NRC is for forty (40) years, and the \nlicense life can be extended at every license renewal \ndate.  The design life for the storage facility and cask, \ncanisters, and assemblies is for eighty (80) years.  The \nservice life for the SNF storage site is one hundred and \ntwenty (120) years.  At this time, the NRC cannot guar-\nantee that a permanent repository for SNF in the \nUnited States will be developed in 40, 80, or 120 years, \n \n2  SECY-14-0072:  Final Rule:  Continued Storage of Spent Nu-\nclear Fuel (RIN 3150-AJ20) https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1417/ \nML14177A474.pdf. \n\n176 \n \nor that the proposed ISP CISF facility will not become \na permanent repository.  Even 80 years of storage at \nthe ISP CISF amounts to impacts beyond the lifetimes \nof everyone involved in this environmental review and \nlicensing decision. \nAs early as the 1950s, the National Academy of Sciences \nrecommended disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes \nin deep, geologically stable formations.3  ISP, however, \nproposes to store highly radioactive and toxic SNF at \nthe surface in an area that is underlain by shallow \ngroundwater.  ISP\u2019s proposed CISF site does not pro-\nvide deep geologic isolation for indefinite SNF storage, \nand the proposed site is unsuitable for SNF storage \nover a period of decades.  Therefore, the No Action Al-\nternative is recommended. \n3. \nThe draft EIS contains numerous technical deficien-\ncies that preclude a thorough evaluation of the radi-\nological and non-radiological environmental im-\npacts of the proposed ISP facility. \nResolving technical deficiencies in the draft EIS and \nproperly evaluating, with all available data, the descrip-\ntion of the affected environment, waste transportation, \nwaste characterization, potential contaminant release \nmechanisms and exposure pathways, potential risks \nfrom aging SNF canisters, and site monitoring will fur-\nther support the No Action Alternative. \n \n \n3  National Research Council.  1957.  The Disposal of Radioactive \nWaste on Land.  Washington, DC:  The National Academies Press.  \nAvailable at https://doi.org/10.17226/10294. \n\n177 \n \na.  Deficiencies Related to Hydrogeologic Charac-\nterization \nThe draft EIS does not contain a comprehensive and in-\nternally consistent hydrologic conceptual site model that \nincludes precipitation, recharge, surface water, ground-\nwater and springs.  Moreover, the draft EIS fails to \nidentify and characterize all groundwater zones that un-\nderlie the site with regard to background water and \nsediment quality, potentiometric surfaces, and direc-\ntions of groundwater flow.  Of particular concern is that \nthe draft EIS does not identify the source of water in \nBaker Springs in New Mexico, and whether these \nsprings could be affected by contaminant discharges at \nthe proposed ISP site. \nThese deficiencies preclude the complete and thorough \nevaluation of contaminant release scenarios, the result-\ning migration and exposure pathways, and the resulting \nrisks to human and ecological health. \nb.  Deficient Evaluation of Potential Contaminant \nRelease Scenarios and Exposure Pathways \nPrevailing wind direction is generally from the pro-\nposed site towards New Mexico.  Groundwater flow be-\nneath the existing waste cells at the site is predomi-\nnantly to the southwest towards New Mexico.  Surface \nwater flow from the site is directed through outfalls that \nflow directly into New Mexico.  The draft EIS fails to \nevaluate how contaminant releases to these pathways \ncould directly migrate into, and impact public health \nand the environment in, New Mexico. \n \n\n178 \n \ni. The draft EIS fails to evaluate the im-\npacts of a radiological release from a \nproximal facility. \nISP\u2019s Environmental Report, in a section titled Proxim-\nity of Hazardous Operations/High-Risk Facilities, erro-\nneously states \u201cthere are no facilities handling large \nquantities of hazardous materials, chemicals, or other \nmaterial in proximity to the site.\u201d  (See \u00a7 2.3.4, Crite-\nrion 13, page 2-27).  Numerous radiological materials \noperations are currently occurring in the vicinity of the \nCISF and are likely to continue or expand in the future.  \nThese operations include the Federal Facilities Waste \nDisposal site, the Compact States Waste Disposal Fa-\ncility, the By-Products Waste Disposal Facility, and the \nuranium enrichment occurring at URENCO.  A radio-\nlogical release from one of these proximal facilities \ncould render the ISP CISF unmanageable, at loss of ca-\npability to function safely, and at risk for accidents and \nrelease of contaminants to the environment. \nii. The draft EIS fails to evaluate the poten-\ntial impacts of a hydrogen sulfide release \nfrom a proposed oil-field waste disposal \nfacility near the site. \nISP\u2019s Environmental Report, in a section titled Land \nUse, erroneously states that \u201cthere are no other now \ncurrent, future, or proposed land use plans, including \nstaged plans, for the proposed CISF or immediate vi-\ncinity.\u201d  (See \u00a7 3.1, page 3-3).  CK Disposal, however, \nhas proposed to construct an oil field waste disposal fa-\ncility near the ISP site.  The draft EIS does not evaluate \nhow releases of hydrogen sulfide from the CK Disposal \nfacility could render the ISP CISF unmanageable, at \n\n179 \n \nloss of capability to function safely, and at risk for acci-\ndents and release of contaminants to the environment. \niii. The draft EIS fails to evaluate the poten-\ntial impacts of numerous boreholes on \nthe ISP property that could act as path-\nways for contaminants to reach ground-\nwater. \nSome 600 boreholes are known to be on the WCS prop-\nerty, and the draft EIS does not provide information on \nhow many boreholes have been improperly abandoned.  \nImproperly plugged or cased boreholes could cause a \nmigratory pathway for contaminant migration to \ngroundwater. \nc. Seismicity not Adequately Addressed \nThe draft EIS asserts that operation of the proposed \nCISF project would not be expected to impact or be im-\npacted by seismic events.  The draft EIS provides gen-\neral information about the history of earthquakes in the \nregion, including earthquakes caused by fluid injection \nby the oil and gas industry, and asserts that CISF in-\nfrastructure will be designed to withstand seismic \nevents, but does not provide specific information about \nthese safeguards.  On March 26, 2020, a magnitude 5.0 \nearthquake struck West Texas near the New Mexico \nborder.4  Since earthquakes of magnitude 5 or greater \nhave already occurred in this area, there is the possibil-\nity that more powerful earthquakes may occur, and the \nISP facility must be designed to withstand these more \npowerful seismic events. \n \n4 https://www.usgs.gov/news/m50-earthquake-hits-west-texas-\nnew-mexico-border. \n\n180 \n \nd. Deficient Waste Characterization \nThe draft EIS fails to provide details of the radionu-\nclides and activities in the spent fuel rods, and only ref-\nerences metric tons of uranium (MTU) in the fuel rods \nthat were originally placed in the nuclear reactors.  \nSpent fuel rods can be much more radioactive than the \noriginal fuel rods due to the presence of a mixture of \nbyproducts from uranium fission. Radionuclide activi-\nties in spent fuel rods can depend on age, uranium \nburnup and decay, and the type of reactor that was \nused. \nFurthermore, the draft EIS does not adequately ad-\ndress the differences in SNF storage (pool storage, dry \nstorage or both) at the commercial reactor sites.  These \ndifferences are important as they may present chal-\nlenges for SNF processing and storage at the proposed \nISP facility. \nThe draft EIS fails to discuss non-radiological contami-\nnants that may potentially be discharged to soil, water \nand air during operation of the site. \n \ne.  Deficiencies Regarding Cannisters and CISF \nInfrastructure \n \n \n \ni. SNF cannisters \nSome of the SNF cannisters that would be shipped to \nthe proposed ISP facility have already been stored for \ndecades.  As fuel rods age they are subject to corrosion, \ndamage or cladding, and the potential for explosive lev-\nels of hydrogen to build up inside the cannisters.  The \ndraft EIS does not adequately address these issues. \nThe SNF cannisters will be stored on concrete pads on \nthe ground surface exposed to the elements.  The draft \nEIS does not address the temperature rating of the \n\n181 \n \nSNF cannisters and if maximum summer temperatures \nat the site are within this temperature rating. \n \n \n \nii. SNF Concrete Pad \nThe draft EIS does not discuss how the concrete pads \nused to store SNF cannisters will be protected or re-\npaired from cracking and spalling due to exposure to \nthe elements of the arid Southwest. \n4. \nThe draft EIS is significantly incomplete without in-\nclusion of all applicable state regulatory oversite \nand environmental impact controls. \nThe draft EIS fails to identify New Mexico water qual-\nity regulatory requirements that apply to the proposed \nISP facility.  As discussed above, contaminants dis-\ncharged by existing WCS operations, as well as by pro-\nposed ISP operations, have the potential to affect water \nquality in New Mexico.  Discharges onto or below the \nground surface at the site, and surface water emanating \nfrom the site that flows toward New Mexico, have the \npotential to infiltrate into the subsurface and into \ngroundwater.  Consequently, NMED required WCS to \nobtain a Groundwater Discharge Permit (DP-1817) for \nWCS\u2019s waste disposal operations. WCS submits \ngroundwater monitoring reports to NMED as required \nby DP-1817 and is currently in compliance with DP-\n1817. \nThe existing Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination \nSystem (TPDES) Permit, and monitoring conducted \npursuant to that permit, is not an adequate substitute \nfor New Mexico\u2019s groundwater permitting and monitor-\ning requirements.  Therefore, ISP must submit a Notice \nof Intent to Discharge to NMED in accordance with \n20.6.2.1201 New Mexico Administrative Code (NMAC) \n\n182 \n \nfor proposed CISF operations.  The final EIS, and spe-\ncifically Table 1.6-1, must identify DP-1817, and ISP\u2019s \nrequirement to submit a Notice of Intent to Discharge. \nSince surface water discharges from the proposed ISP \nsite in Texas may affect surface water quality in New \nMexico, the final EIS should include a requirement that \nthe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality con-\nsults with NMED as a downstream state during the \nTPDES Permit process. \nThe draft EIS fails to commit the NRC to a comprehen-\nsive environmental oversight role during operation of \nthe CISF.  The final EIS must address possible licens-\ning conditions and the NRC\u2019s obligation to evaluate and \nrespond to adverse impacts to environmental media, \ne.g., soil, surface water, groundwater. \n5. \nThe proposed action threatens minority and low-in-\ncome populations in New Mexico that have already \nsuffered disproportionally high adverse human health \nand environment effects from nuclear energy and \nweapons programs of the United States.  The Pro-\nposed Action must comply with Executive Order \n12898 requiring that all federal agencies achieve en-\nvironmental justice for vulnerable populations that \nwould be disproportionately affected by programs of \nthe United States. \nThe proposed action for indefinite storage of commer-\ncial SNF joins the ranks of uranium mining and milling, \nlegacy contamination at national laboratories, and dis-\nposal of defense waste at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \n(WIPP), all of which have long presented risks to public \nhealth and the environment in the State of New Mexico \nthat are disproportionately greater than such risks to \nthe general population of the United States. \n\n183 \n \nThe draft EIS identifies 58.8 percent of the population \nin Lea County, New Mexico as Hispanic or Latino (Ta-\nble 1).  New Mexico\u2019s general percentages of minority \n(Hispanic or Latino and American Indian) and low-in-\ncome populations are significantly greater than in the \nUnited States\u2019 general population (Table 1). \nTable 1.

In fact, the draft EIS \n(pp. 2-28, 2-29) makes repeated, yet unsubstantiated, \nassertions that the Proposed Action will result in \u201cno \ndisproportionately high and adverse human health \nand environmental effects.\u201d  Environmental justice de-\nficiencies in the draft EIS include: \na. Failure to identify and evaluate the cumulative \nhistory of adverse human health and environ-\nmental effects on New Mexico\u2019s vulnerable pop-\nulations; and \nb.

(\u201cFasken\u201d), \nlocated at 6101 Holiday Hill Road, Midland, Texas \n79707 and am a member in good standing of the \nPermian Basin Land and Royalty Owners and \nOperators Coalition (\u201cPBLRO\u201d) and am duly au-\nthorized to execute this affidavit. \nii. I have personal knowledge of the information as \nstated herein. \niii. Fasken presently has lands and mineral inter-\nests within eighteen miles of the proposed WCS/ \nISP CISF located in Andrews County, Texas.  \nThe PBLRO presently has lands and mineral in-\nterests throughout Andrews County with the \nnearest member holding land and minerals with-\nin two miles of the proposed WCS/ISP CISF. \niv. My name is Aaron Pachlhofer, and I am a licensed \ngeologist and geoscientist.  Since 2013, I have \nbeen employed by Fasken Oil & Ranch, Ltd. as \nEnvironmental Coordinator.  In that capacity, \nmy duties include primary management of all en-\nvironmental policies, procedures, and programs \n\n187 \n \nfor air, soil, and water concerns.  My specific du-\nties include coordination and oversight of all spill \nincidents, air permitting & air compliance, man-\nagement of radiation issues, all regulatory inter-\naction & notification, also management & over-\nsight of environmental vendors.  I have know-\nledge of and interpret, prepare comments on and \nensure compliance with all new and current Fed-\neral, state, and local regulations under the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Act (\u201cEPA\u201d), the U.S. \nBureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d), the \nTexas Rail Road Commission (\u201cRRC\u201d), the \nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality \n(\u201cTCEQ\u201d), the New Mexico Environment De-\npartment (\u201cNMED\u201d), and the State of New Mex-\nico Oil Conservation Division (\u201cNMOCD\u201d).  Ad-\nditionally, I monitor legislation, regulations and \nensure compliance with any protected, threat-\nened and endangered species program require-\nments. \nv. In my previous employment, my responsibilities \ninvolved environmental regulatory compliance, \nprogram management, emergency response, en-\nvironmental assessments, groundwater monitor-\ning, remediation and environmental data gather-\ning and analysis. \nvi. I was awarded the B.S. in Geology in 1998 and \nthe M.S. in Geology in 2004 from Sul Ross State \nUniversity, Alpine, Texas. \nvii. In 2003, I received and have maintained a  \nGeologist/ Geoscientist license from the State of \nTexas. \n\n188 \n \n \nThe sections below provide my professional anal-\nysis of the WCS/ISP license application and erro-\nneous analysis of the environment of the proposed \nCISF including WCS/ISP\u2019s contradictory state-\nments regarding the occurrence and movement of \ngroundwater at and beneath the proposed CISF \nand a failure to appreciate the hydrologic process. \nI. \nSPECIFIC CONCERNS REGARDING ISP\u2019S AP-\nPLICATION DOCUMENTS \n \n1. In ISP\u2019s response to RAI WR-6, they provide new \ndetails regarding the presence of groundwater in \nthe northern portion of the CISF and discloses re-\nliance upon insufficient boring data provided by \nWCS. \nA. In responding to RAI WR-6, ISP admittedly \nerred in relying upon WCS\u2019 groundwater \ndata.  ISP reports that erroneous informa-\ntion which admittedly was \u201cnot based on suf-\nficient boring data to distinguish the con-\ntacts between the Antlers and the Ogallala in \nthe proposed CISF area, nor between the \nAntlers and the Gatuna on the south side of \nthe ridge,\u201d misled ISP into previously re-\nporting the lack of presence of groundwater.  \nIn updating their report as to the presence \nor absence of groundwater, ISP reveals that \none to five feet of groundwater is present in \nthe northern portion of the CISF site.  This \nnew information more closely corresponds \nwith earlier statements made by Fasken and \nthe Permian Basin Coalition in that there is \nnow an admission that groundwater is pre-\n\n189 \n \nsent throughout the site and nearer the sur-\nface than had been stated by ISP. \nB. Based upon this new information, I argue \nthat the goal post is constantly moving with \nISP.  Fasken and the Permian Basin Coali-\ntion have repeatedly asserted that cross- \nformational groundwater exists between the \nOgallala and the Antler Formations and these \ntwo aquifers are situated beneath and all \naround the ISP CISF.  As such, the applica-\ntion documents and the ISP DEIS are erro-\nneous and fail to analyze the potential for ra-\ndiological and other environmental impacts \nbased on the siting of a CISF above multiple, \ncross-connected aquifers. \n2. ISP\u2019s response to RAI WR-11 is grounded in gen-\neralizations and is flawed. \nA. In RAI WR-11, NRC Staff request that ISP \nidentify the shallowest groundwater located \nbeneath the proposed CISF footprint by \nname and depth below the CISF land sur-\nface, whether in the Antlers, Ogallala, Gatuna, \nor Cooper Canyon Formation.  Further, \nStaff request that ISP name specific aquifers \nin the Dockum Group in the future and avoid \n\u201cuse of the lumped term \u2018Dockum Aquifer\u2019\u200a\u201d \nas it does not clearly denote the site-specific \naquifer that is being referenced at the pro-\nposed CISF.  Staff also instructs that near-\nsurface groundwater formations be referred \nto by name.  This request is made by Staff in \naccordance with 10 CFR 51.45(b) and (b)(1), \nwhich require that the Environmental Re-\n\n190 \n \nport include a description of the affected en-\nvironment and an assessment of environ-\nmental impacts. \nB.  In response, ISP downplays the presence of \ngroundwater and utilizes generalizations \nwhere factual based evidence is required. \nWhen identifying the \u201cshallowest groundwa-\nter located beneath the proposed CISF foot-\nprint by name and depth below the CISF \nland surface,\u201d the response is nonresponsive.  \nISP answers, \u201cThe shallowest groundwater \nbeneath the proposed CISF footprint is a \nfew inches to a few feet of saturation in the \nundifferentiated Antlers/Ogallala sediments \nstarting at the northern fence line of the Pro-\ntected Area boundary in the northeast cor-\nner.\u201d  They go on to cite their joint venture \nmember, Waste Control Specialists (WCS), \nas their reference source. \nC.  In the instant matter, it is critical to avoid \nbroad generalizations and, instead, rely upon \nevidence-based practice.  It is also critical to \nrely upon scientific-based evidence that is \nsubstantiated.  To cite WCS without the sup-\nport of objective, admissible evidence or \neven so much as an affidavit is not in compli-\nance with the clear standards of the indus-\ntry. \nD.  The low-quality response to RAI WR-11 pre-\nsents new information regarding the pres-\nence of groundwater \u201ca few inches\u201d beneath \nthe CISF footprint.  This admission contra-\ndicts ISP\u2019s previous ERs which fail to differ-\n\n191 \n \nentiate between water beneath WCS versus \nbeneath the CISF.  Instead, previous ERs \nsimply state that the shallowest water bear-\ning zone is about 225 feet deep at the WCS \nCISF.  (WCS Consolidated Interim Storage \nFacility Safety Analysis Report. Rev. 2) \n3. In responding to RAI-WR-5, ISP discusses pota-\nble water from 13 windmills (including the Letter \nB Ranch well) but does not discuss the ground-\nwater wells located within a 10 km radius of the \nWCS site. \n \nA. WCS conducted a water well search in 2007 \nusing Banks Environmental Data Inc.  The \nsearch identified 174 water wells drilled \nwithin a 10 km radius of the WCS landfill site \n(Table 3-1, Banks Survey).  Approximately \n20 of these water wells are at or near the \nWCS site (Figure 6-1).  Most of these wells \nare open to formations less than 200\u2019 deep, \nwhich indicates groundwater production is \nfrom the OAG aquifer unit.  Water usage is \nfor domestic, stock, irrigation, and commer-\ncial purposes (Table 3-1).  These data clearly \nshow that there is groundwater present within \nthe CISF footprint.  Table 3-1 and Figure 6-\n1 are within the Attachment WR-5-2. \n4. ISP\u2019s response to RAI WR-3 indicates that ISP \nhas selectivity ignored or omitted groundwater \ndata. \n \nA. In their response to RAI WR-3, ISP dis-\ncusses geochemical data from well TP-14 \ncompared to water sampled from Baker \nSpring.  ISP does not discuss the aquifer \n\n192 \n \nsource of the water sample collected from \nTP-14, nor does ISP disclose the sampling lo-\ncation.  ISP failed to collect groundwater \nsamples and fails to provide geochemical \ndata from all wells containing groundwater, \nespecially wells containing groundwater that \nare located on the CISF, particularly PZ-47 \nand PZ-57. \n5. ISP\u2019s response to RAI WR-2 provides new details \nregarding playas. \nA. ISP\u2019s response to RAI WR-2 acknowledges \nthe presence of playas and reports that ex-\nisting playas may be as much as \u201ca few feet \ndeep\u201d and as large as a \u201cfew acres\u201d in size.  \nAlthough this generalization lacks the speci-\nficity called for in this type of licensing pro-\nceeding, this admission as to the size and \ndepth of the playas is new information, which \ngives rise to a new contention. \nB. In responding to the RAI WR-2\u2019s request for \nadditional detail on the surface water envi-\nronment at and near the proposed CISF, \nISP reports that there are localized wetland \nfeatures such as playas and man-made exca-\nvations identified by the U.S. Fish and Wild-\nlife Service (USFSW) at the surface of the \nWCS facility.  ISP\u2019s admission that playas \nare present is not new information, however, \nthe newly described size and depth of the \nplayas presents new information that gives \nrise to a contention that the playas pose a \npossible contamination source for groundwa-\nter beneath the site.  As stated in their Con-\n\n193 \n \nsolidated Interim Storage Facility Safety \nAnalysis Report, Rev. 0 (2-18), \u201cThe primary \nsources of recharge to the Ogallala aquifer \nare playas.\u201d  (WCS citing Blandford et al., \n(2003)[2-3].  ISP continually fails to recog-\nnize that playas are a direct connection to \ngroundwater and nexus for contamination \nfrom the surface to groundwater beneath \ntheir site. \nC. Additionally, according to Texas Parks and \nWildlife, playas serve as what has been de-\nscribed as the most important wetland habi-\ntat type for waterfowl.  Failure to provide an \nobjective, scientific study regarding migra-\ntory birds, butterflies and pollinators is poor \nconservation practice and gives rise to this \ncontention that ISP has failed to provide ad-\nequate information regarding a conservation \npractice to demonstrate that they are en-\ngaged in managing and conserving playas \nthat are a critical source of water for wildlife. \nII. ISP\u2019S RESPONSE TO RAIs PRESENTS A SIG-\nNIFICA[N]T ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE \n1. ISP\u2019s new description of groundwater depth and \npresence creates a plausible contamination sce-\nnario. \nA. According to Section 4.4 of ISP\u2019s ER, cask \nstorage pads located at the CISF are \u201cpoten-\ntial source[s] of low-level radioactivity that \ncould enter runoff\u200a\u201d throughout the opera-\ntion of the CISF.  ISP claims that the poten-\ntial levels of radioactivity in rainwater runoff \ndue to surface contamination of the dry casks \n\n194 \n \nwould be \u201cwell below\u201d the effluent discharge \nlimits.  ER Section 4.4 reasons that \u201cthe po-\ntential for negative impacts on surface water \nresources is very low due to lack of water \npresence and formidable natural barriers to \nany surface or subsurface water occur-\nrences.\u201d  As it is now abundantly clear, the \n\u201cformidable natural barriers\u201d of the red bed \nclays no longer provide cover for the ground-\nwater located \u201cwithin inches\u201d of the CISF\u2019s \nsurface.  ISP\u2019s claim regarding potential lev-\nels of radioactivity in runoff is based on its \nerroneous description as to the presence and \ndepth of groundwater.  ISP must reevaluate \nthe potential for groundwater contamination \nbased on accurate, fact-based, present-day \nfindings regarding groundwater.  To do oth-\nerwise, poses a significant threat to the envi-\nronment. \ni. Casks:  Chloride-induced stress cor-\nrosion cracking (CI-SCC) \nCurrently, Dry Storage Casks (DSCs) cannot be in-\nspected once they are placed within their storage \nsystems.  The WCS/ISP facility is located within \n26,000 square miles of the Salado Salt Formation \nthat is replete with surface salt lakes and salt for-\nmation outcrops that critically contain magnesium \nchloride salts (MgCl2) that are the most reactive \nsalt species for the induction and propagation of \nChloride induced stress corrosion cracking (CISCC).  \nThe proposed CISF location is increasingly experi-\nencing the \u201chaboob\u201d sandstorm phenomena that \ntranslocate tons of surface sediments for tens of \nmiles.  The historical paths of haboobs have in-\n\n195 \n \ncluded sweeping storms across the Salado surface \nsalt flats in eastern New Mexico and West Texas. \nAdditionally, persistent fog and mist conditions are \nprevalent during the fall and winter in this region \nof the country.  When combined, a single \u201csalt dep-\nosition\u201d event from a haboob, along with a sufficient \namount of fog/mist event, could easily create the \nconditions that would initiate CISCC. \nIn the U.S. NRC draft report, \u201cIdentification and \nPrioritization of the Technical Information Needs \nAffecting Potential Regulation of Extended Stor-\nage and Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel,\u201d the \nfederal government recognizes the potential risk \nfor monitoring dry casks and the \u201cpitting and crev-\nice corrosion\u201d of the stainless steel canisters, which \naffect the safety functions of confinement, critical-\nity, retrievability (of fuel from the dry storage can-\nister), shielding (of radiation from people and the \nenvironment), and thermal (degradation of the fuel, \npotentially leading to fuel fires). \nFurther, the potential for stress corrosion cracking \nof welded stainless steel interim storage containers \nfor spent nuclear fuel (SNF) has been identified as \na high priority data gap by the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board (NWTRB), the Electric \nPower Research Institute (EPRI), the Department \nof Energy (DOE) Fuel Cycle Research and Devel-\nopment (FCRD) programs and Used Fuel Disposi-\ntion (UFD) campaign (Hanson et al, 2012) and the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC 2012a; \n2012b). \n\n196 \n \nLittle has been done to assess canister material \nproperties and their impact on corrosion, especially \nlocalized corrosion. \nIn response to the numerous ways in which CISCC \ncan occur and which are raised in this affidavit, \nWCS/ISP will likely argue that CISCC is an impos-\nsibility, or they may go so far as to claim that re-\nsearch is underway to increase understanding of \nthe CISCC mechanism and to develop techniques \nfor detecting CISCC in SNF canisters.  However, a \nbetter understanding of the vulnerability of the \ncanisters does not equate to a solution and is dis-\ncordant to a continually progressing license appli-\ncation.  Simply put, the SNF canister system which \nis meant to confine radioactive material is not \nproven to resist CISCC and is not, therefore, guar-\nanteed to confine radioactive material. \nii. Mitigating Controls upon a Release / \nContainment monitoring \nWCS/ISP has no way of inspecting the canisters \nonce installed in the CISF.  Currently, WCS/ISP \nhas no plans to monitor the dry storage casks but \nonly to perform occasional \u201cleak tests of the acces-\nsible surfaces of the DSCs.\u201d  Additionally, WCS/ \nISP has no plans to monitor either DSC tempera-\ntures or airborne effluents that could emerge from \na breached DSC.  Once there is a breach, there is \nno way to repair a DSC or stop a DSC from leaking \nwithout first contaminating the facility and the en-\nvironment.  Without proven monitoring or inspec-\ntion capabilities that i) are proactive in monitoring \nthe entire DSC and not only occasionally and not \nonly that small exposed portion of the partially bur-\n\n197 \n \nied DSC; ii) recognize areas of corrosion or vulner-\nability; and iii) have the capacity to properly repair \nsusceptible DSCs, then it is impossible to argue \nthat a significant environmental threat is not likely \nto occur. \nIII. HAD ISP\u2019S RESPONSE TO RAIs BEEN CONSID-\nERED \nIN[I]TIALLY, \nCONTENTION \nFOUR \nWOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN ADMITTED \n1. ISP has failed to provide accurate information \ndescribing the environment. \nA. NRC Regulation 10 CFR 51.45(b)(1) re-\nquires an applicant\u2019s ER to \u201ccontain a de-\nscription of the  . . .  environment affected, \nand discuss  . . .  the impact of the proposed \naction on the environment.\u201d  ISP has failed \nto satisfy this requirement.  While ISP may \nhave now provided a more accurate descrip-\ntion of existing groundwater, the ER\u2019s anal-\nysis of the impact on the environment is \nbased on older, erroneous descriptions.  With-\nout an accurate description of the affected \nenvironment, a proper impact analysis can-\nnot be made.  All safety and environmental \nreports, data, and analysis based on ISP\u2019s \nfaulty descriptions of the environment, be-\nfore the response to the RAIs had been made, \nshould be criticized until ISP reevaluates the \nimpact that the site will have based on the \nnew descriptions provided in the response to \nRAIs. \nB.  Until ISP reevaluates the impacts to ground-\nwater, the site will continue to pose a serious \ncontamination risk to the groundwater, and \n\n198 \n \nISP will fail to satisfy the burden of 10 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 51.45(b)(1) to discuss the impact of \nthe proposed action on the environment. \nC.  Because ISP cannot satisfy its burden based \non 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.45(b)(1) to discuss the im-\npact on the newly described environment, \namended Contention Four should likely be \nadmitted.   \nISP has stated that there is no risk of groundwater con-\ntamination.  However it appears that ISP has not eval-\nuated all of the chemical properties of the radiological \nproducts that will be stored in the dry casks.  One of the \nprimary daughter products of fission inside of a nuclear \nreactor is cesium (also spelled caesium) 137 with a half-\nlife of 30.2 years.  Cesium-137 is the primary contami-\nnant of concern in the well known Chernobyl Exclusion \nZone that was created after the 1986 nuclear reactor ac-\ncident in the Ukraine.  Cesium 137 is also widely found \nacross most European countries as a result of the Cher-\nnobyl accident.  Notably, cesium-137 has been detected \nin the food chain of wild game where all animals that are \nharvested (usually boar and reindeer) are required to \nbe tested for radiation that resulted from Chernobyl.  \nAs a result of the cesium, the Chernobyl Exclusion zone \nwill have to remain about the year 2,107.   \nAccording to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-\nease Registry, cesium is the most reactive of the alkali \nmetals and has a melting point of 83.1 degrees F.  Ce-\nsium will readily combine with inorganics such as chlo-\nride or carbonate (both readily available in western \nTexas).  With water, it creates cesium hydroxide which \nis the strongest base known to science.  Cesium chloride \nis soluble in water at 1.87 kg/L, cesium carbonate at 2.1 \n\n199 \n \nkg/L, and cesium hydroxide at 4 kg/L.  For perspective, \nsodium chloride is soluble in water at .36 kg/L according \nto the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (92nd \ned).  Cesium-137 has the ability to spread widely and \nrapidly into the environment once released.  Cesium \nchloride and cesium carbonate are fine white solids that \nwill transport quickly and easily with a small amount of \nwind.  ISP has questioned how contamination might oc-\ncur in the event that a dry cask might leak or rupture.  \nHowever cesium compounds are easily transported by \nthe wind and have high water solubility.  Any cask \nbreach or other accidental release would allow cesium \nto rapidly spread downwind (the wind always blows in \nwest Texas).  Once deposited onto a ground surface af-\nter wind transport, the cesium will dissolve into water \nwith the first available precipitation event and begin in-\nfiltrating into the local water table where the cesium has \nfallen. Combined with the risk of cask breach by chlo-\nride induced stress corrosion cracking, ISP cannot be \nallowed to store the waste in west Texas. \n \n \n\n200 \n \nFederal Register Notice: \n85FR27447 \nComment Number:    \n10357 \nMail Envelope Properties   (SA0PR19MB44607BBF88F \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFA0323611E5C4D5EF0) \nSubject:  \n \n \n[External_Sender] Docket No. 72-1050 \n/ NRC-2016-0231 \nSent Date:    \n \n11/3/2020 9:07:03 PM \nReceived Date:  \n11/3/2020 9:07:14 PM \nFrom: \n \n \n \nMonica Perales \nCreated By:  \n \nmonicap@forl.com \nRecipients: \nPost Office: \n \nSA0PR19MB4460.namprd19.prod.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \noutlook.com \nFiles   \n \n \n \nSize  \n \n Date & Time \nMESSAGE  \n \n19528  \n \n 11/3/2020 9:07:14 PM \nOptions \nPriority:  Standard \nReturn Notification:   \nNo \nReply Requested:    \nNo \nSensitivity:   \n \n \n \nNormal \nExpiration Date: \nRecipients Received: \n \n \n\n201 \n \nPUBLIC SUBMISSION \nAs of:  11/4/20 9:14 AM \nReceived:  November 03, \n2020 \nStatus:  Pending_Post \nTracking No. kh2-ioec-pk6q \nComments Due:  November \n03, 2020 \nSubmission Type:  Web \nDocket:  NRC-2016-0231 \nWaste Control Specialists LLC\u2019s Consolidated Interim \nSpent Fuel Storage Facility Project \nComment On:  NRC-2016-0231-0317 \nInterim Storage Partners Consolidated Interim Stor-\nage Facility Project \nDocument:  NRC-2016-0231-DRAFT-0371 \nComment on FR Doc # 2020-09795 \nSubmitter Information \nEmail:   chikaodi.agumadu@tceq.texas.gov \nGovernment Agency Type:   State \nGovernment Agency:  TCEQ \n \n \n\n202 \n \nGeneral Comment \nOn behalf of TCEQ, please find our comments regard-\ning the Notice by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:  \nInterim Storage Partners Consolidated Interim Stor-\nage Facility Project. \nIf you have any questions concerning the enclosed \ncomments, please contact Mr. Brad Broussard of the \nRadioactive Materials Division, at (512)239-6380, or at \nbrad.broussard@tceq.texas.gov. \nThank you \nChikaodi Agumadu \nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality \nIntergovernmental Relations Division \nAttachments \nNRC Comments_11032020 \n \n\n203 \n \n \n \n \n \nJon Niermann, Chairman \nEmily Lindley, Commissioner \nBobby Janecka, Commissioner \nToby Baker, Executive Director \nTEXAS COMMISSION ON  \nENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY \nProtecting Texas by Reducing and  \nPreventing Pollution \nNovember 3, 2020 \nOffice of Administration \nMail Stop:  TWFN-7-A60M \nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nWashington, DC 20555-0001 \nATTN: \nProgram Management, Announcements and \nEditing Staff \nSubject: Draft Environmental Impact Statement for \nInterim Storage Partners License Application to Con-\nstruct and Operate a Consolidated Interim Storage Fa-\ncility for Spent Nuclear Fuel and Greater-Than Class C \nWaste (Docket ID NRC-2016-0231) \nDear Office of Administration Staff: \nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ap-\npreciates the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Nu-\nclear Regulatory Commission Draft Environmental Im-\npact Statement (EIS) for Interim Storage Partners\u2019 Li-\n\n204 \n \ncense Application to Construct and Operate a Consoli-\ndated Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel \nand Greater-Than Class C Waste.

This authority resides with the fed-\neral government, specifically the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (NRC). \nThe TCEQ has significant policy concerns as they per-\ntain to the adjacent low-level radioactive waste disposal \nfacility.  The CISF proposal has unprecedented impli-\ncations as it has created significant unease with the pub-\nlic.  Continuing with this licensing action jeopardizes \npublic consent and presents significant challenges as we \ncarry out our responsibility to regulate the low-level ra-\ndioactive waste disposal facility. \nSpecific Comments \n1. \nPage 2-2, Line 4\u2014The EIS states \u201cIn its license ap-\nplication, ISP has requested that NRC license the \nproposed CISF to operate for a period of 40 years \n(ISP, 2020).  ISP stated that it may seek to renew \nthe license for an additional 20 years, for a total 60-\nyear operating life (ISP, 2020).  Renewal of the li-\ncense beyond an initial 40 years would require ISP \n\n206 \n \nto submit a license renewal request, which would be \nsubject to an NRC safety and environmental review \nat that time.\u201d \n \nComment:  The TCEQ understands that the initial \nlicensing period for a CISF is 40 years with the abil-\nity for an additional renewal period of 40 years.  \nBased on the requirements in 10 Code of Federal \nRegulations (CFR) Part 72, the applicant is only re-\nquired to provide technical and design analyses for \nthe term of the license being requested.  Because \n10 CFR Part 72 appears to only allow one 40-year \nlicense renewal term, how will the NRC ensure that \ninterim storage does not extend beyond the second \n40-year license term, or in this case a 20-year term?  \nSince the U.S. Department of Energy has been un-\nsuccessful in developing a permanent geologic re-\npository, the TCEQ is concerned that a CISF in \nTexas will become the permanent solution for dis-\npositioning the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel (SNF). \n2. \nPage 2-2, Line 9\u2014The EIS states \u201cBy the end of the \nlicense term of the proposed CISF, the NRC staff \nexpects that the SNF stored at the proposed facility \nwould have been shipped to a permanent geologic \nrepository.  This expectation of repository availa-\nbility is consistent with the NRC\u2019s analysis in Ap-\npendix B of NUREG\u20132157, \u201cGeneric Environmen-\ntal Impact Statement for Continued Storage of \nSpent Nuclear Fuel,\u201d (NRC, 2014).  In that analy-\nsis, the NRC concluded that the reasonable period \nfor the development of a repository is approxi-\nmately 25 to 35 years (i.e., the repository is availa-\nble by 2048) based on experience in licensing simi-\nlarly complex facilities in the United States and na-\n\n207 \n \ntional and international experience with reposito-\nries already in progress (NRC, 2014). \n \nComment:  The NRC did not address an alternative \nor contingency for stored SNF in the event that a \npermanent geologic repository is not developed and \nlicensed at the end of a CISF license term.  The as-\nsumption is speculative and may result in the State \nof Texas becoming the permanent solution for dis-\nposition of SNF. \n3. \nPage 2-2, Line 36\u2014The EIS states \u201cThe Federal \nWaste Disposal Facility.  This facility serves the \nU.S. Department of Energy 36 (DOE) and is also \nauthorized to dispose Class A, B, and C LLRW and \nMixed Low-Level Waste (MLLW) under Texas Ra-\ndioactive Materials License No. R04100, Amend-\nment No. 30 (TCEQ, 2016a).\u201d \n \nComment:  The Federal Waste Disposal Facility is \nauthorized to receive both LLRW and MLLW.

The May 2020 draft \nEnvironmental Impact Statement (EIS) is significantly \nflawed and does not adequately address significant \nthreats to the health and safety of New Mexicans, im-\npacts to our economy, and protection of our environ-\nment. \n\n212 \n \nThe U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) pro-\nposed approval of the ISP license application to con-\nstruct and operate a CISF for SNF and Greater-Than-\nClass C waste and spent mixed oxide fuel at the existing \nWaste Control Specialists (WCS) site in Andrews \nCounty, Texas.  If licensed, the facility could store up to \n5,000 metric tons of uranium (MTUs) for a license pe-\nriod of 40 years.  ISP has indicated that they will seek \namendments and extensions of the license to store an \nadditional 5,000 MTUs for each of seven expansion \nphases over 20 years, resulting in an expanded facility \nwith total storage of up to 40,000 MTUs of spent nuclear \nfuel. \nNew Mexicans have a vested interest in this proposed \naction due to the proximity of the site to the Texas-New \nMexico border; the facility is located just .37 miles east \nof the border and five miles east of Eunice, New Mexico.  \nAdditionally, the New Mexico side of the border is more \ndensely populated, meaning that the proposed action \nwould disproportionately impact New Mexicans in the \nimmediate area. \nThe draft EIS does not adequately address the many \nsafety concerns that siting a CISF in Andrews County, \nTexas raises.  With no active planning for a permanent \nrepository for SNF underway, there is significant risk \nthat this and other facilities proposed as interim storage \nfacilities become de facto permanent repositories.  Over \ntime, it is likely that the casks storing spent nuclear fuel \nand high-level waste will lose integrity and will require \nrepackaging.  Any repackaging of spent nuclear fuel \nand high-level waste increases the risk of accidents and \nradiological health risks.  The consequences of a release \nof radiation due to accidental events (such as fire, flood, \nearthquakes, ruptures of fuel rods, explosion, lightning, \n\n213 \n \nextreme temperatures and more), potential acts of ter-\nrorism or sabotage, and the risks associated with aging \nspent nuclear fuel canisters all pose unacceptable health, \nsafety, and environmental risks that the draft EIS fails \nto address. \nFurther, the ISP project would place unfunded safety \nmandates on local communities.  Transporting spent nu-\nclear fuel across the nation is complex and extremely \ndangerous.  Safe transportation of spent nuclear fuel re-\nquires both well-maintained infrastructure and highly \nspecialized emergency response equipment and person-\nnel that can respond quickly to an incident at the facility \nor on transit routes.  New Mexico residents cannot af-\nford and should not be expected to bear the costs asso-\nciated with transporting material to the proposed CISF \nor responding to an accident on transport routes or near \nthe facility. \nThe proposed CISF also poses unacceptable economic \nrisk to New Mexicans, who look to southeastern New \nMexico as a driver of economic growth in our state.  \nNew Mexico\u2019s agricultural industry contributes approx-\nimately $3 billion per year to the state\u2019s economy, $300 \nmillion of which is generated in Eddy and Lea Counties, \nadjacent to the West Texas site.  Further, the site is lo-\ncated in the Permian Basin, which is the largest inland \noil and gas reservoir and the most prolific oil and gas \nproducing region in the world.  New Mexico\u2019s oil and \nnatural gas industry contributed approximately $2 bil-\nlion to the state last year, driven by production in Lea \nand Eddy County.  Any disruption of agricultural or oil \nand gas activities as a result of a perceived or actual nu-\nclear incident would be catastrophic to New Mexico, and \neven taking steps toward siting a CISF in the area could \n\n214 \n \ncause a decrease in investment in two of our state\u2019s big-\ngest industries. \nRecognizing the risks outlined above, a broad range of \nbusinesses, state, local, and tribal leaders have ex-\npressed their opposition to this project and to a similar \nproject in New Mexico proposed by Holtec Interna-\ntional.  That opposition includes both myself and Gover-\nnor Abbott of Texas, who similarly recognizes the risk \na CISF in this region poses to Texas residents. \nThe ISP proposal poses unacceptable risk to New Mex-\nico\u2019s citizens, communities, and economy, and I urge you \nto deny the ISP license application. \n \nSincerely, \n/s/ MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM \nMICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM \nGovernor\n\n215 \n \n \n \n \n \nGOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT \nSeptember 10, 2021 \nThe Honorable Christopher T. Hanson \nChairman \nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nMail Stop 0-16 B33 \nWashington, D.C. 20555-0001 \nRe: \nInterim Storage Partners (ISP) Consolidated  \nInterim Storage Facility Project, Docket ID \nNRC-2016-0231 \nDear Chairman Hanson: \nIn my capacity as Governor of Texas, I previously sub-\nmitted comments opposing ISP\u2019s application for a li-\ncense to construct and operate a consolidated interim \nstorage facility in Andrews County, Texas.  Despite \nTexas\u2019s strong opposition, the NRC has been rushing to \nissue the requested license.  I am writing again to reit-\nerate that the proposed ISP facility is unacceptable to \nthe State of Texas, and to put the NRC on notice of an \nimportant legal development. \nOn September 2, 2021, the Texas Legislature over-\nwhelmingly passed House Bill 7, which bans the storage \nand disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent \nnuclear fuel in Texas.  The legislation also prohibits the \n\n216 \n \nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality from is-\nsuing certain permits for the construction or operation \nof a facility that stores high-level radioactive waste or \nspent nuclear fuel.  On September 9, 2021, I signed \nHouse Bill 7, and it immediately became law.  A copy of \nthe legislation is attached for the NRC\u2019s information. \nAs I wrote on November 3, 2020, the State of Texas has \nserious concerns with the design of the proposed ISP \nfacility and with locating it in an area that is essential to \nthe country\u2019s energy security.  Now the State has made \nclear that a consolidated interim storage facility is not \nonly unwelcome here, but illegal.  To avoid the potential \nfor costly and protracted litigation, I again urge the \nNRC to deny ISP\u2019s license application. \nSincerely, \n/s/ GREG ABBOTT \nGREG ABBOTT \nGovernor \nGA:cgd C.I. 127 \n \n \n\n217 \n \nH.B.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n(NRC) is the lead agency overseeing the National En-\nvironmental Protection Act (NEPA) process to deter-\nmine what environmental impacts could exist if such a \nfacility was constructed, operated, and (ultimately) de-\ncommissioned.  The NRC released its Final Environ-\nmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in July 2021, with \nNRC staff recommending that \u201csubject to the determi-\nnations in the staff\u200a\u2019s safety review of the application, \nthe proposed license be issued to ISP to construct and \noperate a CISF at the proposed location to temporarily \nstore up to 5,000 MTUs [metric tons of uranium] of SNF \n[spent nuclear fuel] for a licensing period of 40 years\u201d \n(NRC 2021, page 2-29). \nMyself and my team at Great Ecology have reviewed \nrelevant materials from NRC\u2019s FEIS for the Andrews \nCounty CISF.  This project has met severe opposition \nfrom local, regional, and national stakeholders.  Promi-\nnent environmental advocacy groups like the Sierra \nClub are on the same side as private companies in oil \nand gas exploration, with both groups raising concerns \nover the destructive impacts HLW storage would have \nin the region.  There is bipartisan political opposition to \nthe project from both the Democratic and Republican \ngovernors of New Mexico and Texas.  This project will \nlikely continue to face significant backlash from con-\n\n229 \n \ncerned citizens and industries, NEPA regulations not-\nwithstanding.  \nFigure 1:  Proposed ISP CISF Facility  \n(from NRC 2021: Figure 2.2-1) \n  \n\n230 \n \nI believe the FEIS was conducted with a pre-deter-\nmined outcome and did not take the requisite \u201chard \nlook\u201d as required by NEPA.  Many components were \nnot accurately evaluated such as: \n\u2022  The purpose and need of the facility is not \u201cin-\nterim;\u201d \n\u2022  The technical studies undertaken for the NEPA \nanalysis were piecemealed across several years \nand therefore the FEIS does not provide a thor-\nough and consistent evaluation for some issues; \n\u2022  The alternatives analysis does not sufficiently \nevaluate all \u2018reasonable\u2019 alternatives to the pro-\nject; \n\u2022  The Environmental Justice analysis should be \nupdated after NRC completes its internal policy; \n\u2022  The No Action Alternative was poorly elucidated \nand not evaluated adequately; \n\u2022  Not all cumulative impacts are identified for trans-\nportation, groundwater, ecology (particularly wild-\nlife), and climate change, and the geographic ex-\ntents used for cumulative impact evaluation are \narbitrary and incorrect; \n\u2022  The mitigation analysis is not robust, does not \nplace any responsibility on NRC for ensuring \nmitigation is implemented, and does not include \nan analysis of the likelihood of implementation of \nthose mitigation measures outside the NRCs ju-\nrisdiction.  For example, NRC assumes that mit-\nigation for emergency response will be the re-\nsponsibility of local first responders, even though \nthe additional risks, training, and costs for such \n\n231 \n \nemergency response were not evaluated in the \nFEIS; \n\u2022  NRC showed an almost total disregard for public \ninput on the FEIS, and dismissed several com-\nments without adequate explanation or evalua-\ntion; \n\u2022  Several categories were determined to have \nSMALL/MODERATE impacts, without a careful \nevaluation of the magnitude of actual impacts; \nand \n\u2022  The ecological resource analysis is incomplete \nand insufficient for multiple wildlife species of \nconservation significance. \n2.0 PROCEDURAL GAPS \nThe NRC received over 10,000 comments as part of the \npublic comment process, with multiple comments high-\nlighting deficiencies in the FEIS evaluation (see:  NRC \n2021, Comments D.2.1.1 through D. 2.1.17, pages D-2 \nthrough D-12).  My team and I identified many issues \nwith the FEIS that are illustrative of a poorly done \nNEPA process by NRC, discussed further below. \n2.1 Purpose and Need:  Not an \u201cInterim\u201d facility \nThe \u201cinterim\u201d facility described by NRC does not pro-\nvide adequate assurance that the CISF project is not a \npermanent repository.  \u201cInterim\u201d implies that there is \na final, long-term solution established already (i.e., a \npermanent repository of HLW has already been ap-\nproved and constructed).  The current purpose and need \nstates that the facility would receive and store HLW \n\u201cbefore a permanent repository is available\u201d (NRC \n2021, page 1-3), which heightens the risk that this facil-\nity could serve as a de facto permanent repository. \n\n232 \n \nThis is a major concern that has been brought up by \nmultiple experts and government officials, including the \ngovernors of New Mexico and Texas.  In public com-\nments submitted by Tami Thatcher on behalf of the En-\nvironmental Defense Institute (November 2018), the \n\u201cinterim\u201d status without the existence of licensed per-\nmanent disposal effectively results in the stranding of \nNSW at the ISP facility for an undetermined duration \npotentially exceeding the ISP facility\u2019s license period or \nthe time horizon upon which the NEPA evaluation was \nbased.  Governor Greg Abbott of Texas wrote a letter \nopposing after reviewing the draft Environmental Im-\npact Statement (EIS) in November 2020.  Governor Ab-\nbott also raised concerns about the \u201cinterim\u201d definition \nof the facility, and noted that the EIS \n\u201c[S]imply assumes  . . .  that a permanent geologic \nrepository will be developed and licensed before 60 \nyears are up, without addressing any contingency for \nthe spent nuclear fuel if such a repository is not \nready when ISP\u2019s license expires\u201d (Abbott 2020). \nGovernor Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico has \nraised similar concerns about \u201cinterim\u201d storage, point-\ning out that \u201cat this time, the NRC cannot guarantee \nthat a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel in \nthe United States will be developed in 40, 80, or 120 \nyears\u201d (Grisham 2020). \nThe statement that this will be an \u201cinterim\u201d storage fa-\ncility of HLW is deliberately misleading.  Policymakers \nand experts are rightly pointing out the high risk of the \nwaste becoming abandoned, since a permanent reposi-\ntory does not exist to eventually accept the waste, nor \nis there a reasonable evidentiary basis for NRC to so \nfind. \n\n233 \n \n2.2 NEPA Studies:  Piecemeal \nThe studies for NEPA were performed in piecemeal, \nwhich weakens the overall FEIS analysis and does not \npresent a clear picture of all impacts from these discrete \nsections.  Study timelines vary in the document, with \nsome studies being performed in the early and mid-\n2010s (Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice, Cul-\ntural and Historical Resources) and others as recent as \n2020.  Several studies were not performed by NRC, ra-\nther by other federal agencies or by other third parties \nthat did not perform studies explicitly for NEPA.  NRC \nrelies on these analyses without further evaluating how \neach individual study relates to the others; with this piece-\nmeal approach, impacts cannot be evaluated across time \nor space.  The FEIS should not have been siloed. \nThe deference to NRC\u2019s authority should only be lim-\nited to their subject(s) of expertise and should not ex-\ntend to all categories in the FEIS.  NRC staff are ex-\nperts in nuclear safety and radioactive exposures/risks, \nand as such their opinions on the FEIS should be de-\nferred to if making a decision on safety risks.  However, \nNRC grants itself deference for their NEPA determi-\nnations on issues outside of their realm of expertise, alt-\nhough such deference is illogical.  For example, nation-\nwide transportation is regulated by the Department of \nTransportation (USDOT) and the Federal Highway Ad-\nministration (FHWA); as such, USDOT and FHWA \nshould be deferred to for opinions and interpretations. \nNRC cannot be an expert in every evaluation; if an im-\npact is not within their purview for evaluation, their de-\nterminations should be given less deference. \n \n \n\n234 \n \n2.3 Alternatives Analysis:  Insufficient \nNEPA requires a review of reasonable project alterna-\ntives.  Alternative analyses should clearly indicate why \nand how the range of project alternatives was devel-\noped, including what kind of public and agency input \nwas used.  In addition, alternatives analysis should ex-\nplain why and how alternatives were eliminated from \nconsideration.  It must be made clear what criteria were \nused to eliminate alternatives, at what point in the pro-\ncess the alternatives were removed, who was involved \nin establishing the criteria for assessing alternatives, \nand the measures for assessing the alternatives\u2019 effec-\ntiveness. \nSection 2.2 of the FEIS identifies the alternatives con-\nsidered for detailed analysis including the Proposed Ac-\ntion and the No Project Alternative.  Meanwhile, Sec-\ntion 2.3 of the FEIS identifies eight alternatives elimi-\nnated from detailed analysis including: \n1) \nStorage at a government-owned CISF operated \nby the Department of Energy (DOE); \n2) \nAlternative Design or Storage Technologies, \nwhich had three alternatives including: \n \n a) DCSS Design Alternatives, \n \nb) Hardened \nOnsite \nStorage \nSystems \n(HOSS), \n \nc) Hardened Extended-Life Local Monitored \nSurface Storage (HELMS); and \n3) \nLocation Alternatives (four options). \nThe alternatives eliminated from consideration were \neliminated (respectively) for the following reasons: \n\n235 \n \n1) \nIn planning stages lacking siting and design \nnecessary for comparison of impacts. \n2) \na) new technology too speculative to be consid-\nered. \n \nb) generalized concept lacking detailed plans \nnecessary for detailed safety, environmental, \nand cost/benefit analysis and does not meet the \npurpose and need for the proposed action. \n \nc) lacking sufficient location-specific informa-\ntion for detailed analysis and would not fully \nmeet the purpose and need of the proposed ac-\ntion. \n3) \nNone clearly environmentally preferable to \nISP\u2019s proposed site.   \nSection 2.3 of the FEIS does not explicitly state objec-\ntive criteria used to eliminate alternatives instead elim-\ninating some alternatives based on the stage of develop-\nment, speculative nature of technologies, or the failure \nof an alternative to meet the proposed action\u2019s purpose \nand need.  If an alternative is eliminated from further \nconsideration because it \u201cdoes not meet the purpose and \nneed,\u201d the lead agency must adequately explain how or \nwhy this alternative doesn\u2019t meet the purpose and need \n(USDOT 2021).  Narrowly written purpose and need \nstatements, which are designed to limit alternative re-\nview, are dubious and, as described above, the purpose \nand need stated in the ISP FEIS fails to adequately \nacknowledge the possibility that the ISP project may in \nfact become de facto permanent storage without better \nassurances to the contrary.  Finally, Section 2.3 of the \nFEIS identifies who was involved in establishing the \ncriteria for assessing alternatives or measures for as-\n\n236 \n \nsessing the alternatives\u2019 effectiveness as required un-\nder NEPA. \nPrevious NEPA documents for \u201cinterim\u201d nuclear stor-\nage facilities have evaluated multiple alternatives as \npart of the general analysis.  For instance, NRC com-\npiled an FEIS for a proposed CISF storage facility in \nUtah that incorporated three different alternatives for \nanalysis, including alternatives for technology, sites, \nand transportation options (NRC et al. 2001).  This cur-\nrent FEIS does not follow past precedent, and as such \nneeds to include a more thorough evaluation and analy-\nsis of any and all alternatives to the proposed project. \n2.4 Environmental Justice: Evaluation Needs to be Up-\ndated \nPresident Joe Biden issued Executive Order (EO) \n14008 in January 2021, which addresses several envi-\nronmental issues like climate change, deforestation, and \nnon-renewable energy.  Chief among the Administra-\ntion\u2019s priorities is environmental justice, and the EO di-\nrects federal agencies to \u201cdevelop programs, policies, \nand activities to address the disproportionate health, \nenvironmental, economic, and climate impacts on disad-\nvantaged communities\u201d (White House 2021).  The NRC \nis in the process of updating its policy and guidance doc-\numents relating to environmental justice evaluations \nand is currently accepting public comments through \nSeptember 22, 2021.  Therefore, it is likely that NRC \nwill update its policy by the end of September or Octo-\nber 2021.  With this in mind, the current FEIS should \nbe suspended until NRC establishes a policy and guid-\nance reflective of the goals in the 2021 EO.  When NRC \nhas established final guidance in the future, the envi-\n\n237 \n \nronmental justice portion of the FEIS should be re-\nevaluated. \n2.5 No Action Alternative:  Dismissed and Not Carefully \nEvaluated \nThe FEIS does an insufficient job of elucidating the sta-\ntus quo or No Action Alternative and of analyzing the \nimpacts of a No Action Alternative.  NEPA requires \nFederal lead agencies to always describe and analyze a \n\u201cno action\u201d alternative in an EIS.  In simple terms, a No \nAction Alternative considers the effects of not approv-\ning the action under consideration.  The No Action Al-\nternative analysis provides a benchmark to allow deci-\nsion makers and the public to compare the levels of en-\nvironmental effects of the alternatives. \nWithin the FEIS, characterization of the No Action Al-\nternative or status quo is entirely dismissed.  It is not \npurely a default to the existing environmental setting.  \nImplicit in the comparison of impacts is consideration \nthat status quo itself has benefits as well as drawbacks, \nand very little if any effort is provided in the FEIS to \nexplicitly identify these.  For example, within Table 2.4-\n1, under the topic of Socioeconomics, the No Action Al-\nternative is indicated to have no impact significance, \nwhile clearly, some sort of beneficial impact to local fi-\nnance (identified in the adjacent column for the pro-\nposed action) is being sacrificed under the No Action \nAlternative without being included in the analysis.  This \nillustrates that a thoughtful analysis is lacking because \nthe No Action Alternative or status quo was insuffi-\nciently evaluated. \n \n \n\n238 \n \n2.6 Cumulative Impacts Analysis:  Insufficient \nCumulative impacts under NEPA are defined as \u201cthe \nimpact on the environment which results from the in-\ncremental impact of the action when added to other \npast, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions \nregardless of what agency (Federal or non-federal)  \nor person undertakes such other actions\u201d (40 CFR  \n\u00a7 1508.7).  The FEIS does not thoroughly evaluate the \ncumulative impacts of the ISP CISF Project along with \nall other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable fu-\nture projects in the project vicinity.  Of major concern, \nmany cumulative impacts are evaluated across geo-\ngraphic scales that do not accurately represent the \nscope and scale of potential impacts or underlying so-\ncial, ecological, geological, or hydrological processes.  \nFIGURE 2 and TABLE 1 depict all impact radii across \ncategories; of note, these are variable and are not ap-\nplied across all categories.  For example, cumulative im-\npacts to ecological resources are only evaluated within \na 5-mile buffer around the ISP site; in contrast, trans-\nportation is evaluated within a 50-mile buffer.  There is \nlittle to no explanation for why ISP chose these radii for \necology and transportation, and if in fact these buffers \ntruly represent cumulative impacts from the site (which, \nin the case of these two categories, they do not).  For \nthese and other radii chosen by ISP, NRC blindly ac-\ncepted these values without further discussion or eval-\nuation in the FEIS. \nNotably, several categories of assessment show consid-\nerable deficiencies in the depth and detail of analysis, \nincluding (but not limited to): \n\u2022 Transportation; \n\u2022 Groundwater resources; \n\n239 \n \n\u2022 Ecological impacts on wildlife; and \n\u2022 Climate change. \nFigure 2:  Cumulative Impact Radii from ISP \nFEIS (NRC 2021) \n\n240 \n \nTable 1:  Variable Radii for Environmental and  \nCumulative Impacts Analysis, ISP FEIS \n2.6.1 Transportation \nThe FEIS assumes all effects from transportation \nwould be incremental over time.  This does not appear \nto be the case as this facility would increase the region\u2019s \nimportance as a HLW storage and disposal destination \n\n241 \n \nincreasing traffic volumes in a more than incremental \nmanner.  In addition, the arbitrary radius imposed on \nthe cumulative impact assessment does not appear to ap-\npropriately consider the national and regional sources of \nHLW and long-distance freight system impacts. \nThe FEIS also downplays the nationwide extent of \nwhere HLW would be arriving from, since HLW is cur-\nrently stored at nuclear energy facilities dispersed \nthroughout the country.  FIGURE 3 shows the locations \nof nuclear reactor sites across the US, along with the \nrailroad network that would need to be utilized to \ntransport waste currently existing at these sites.  Illus-\ntrations and figures in the FEIS do not show the true \nbreadth of this problem, and instead separately show \nthe rail network and decommissioned nuclear power \nplants (FIGURE 4).  HLW is spread throughout the \ncountry, and the extent of its transportation to the ISP \nCISF facility has a much larger impact (and would be \nmore than \u2018incremental\u2019) than the FEIS presents.  It \nalso ignores what the surrounding local community \nlooks like, and what sensitive receptors could be most \nimpacted.  FIGURE 5 depicts several facilities with vul-\nnerable populations in the area (an extrapolation of the \nrail network presented by NRC in FIGURE 4); many \nof these sensitive receptors are located quite close to \nthe railroads in the area.  Should any accident occur in \nthe future, these people would certainly be impacted \nquite heavily. \n \n \n\n242 \n \nFigure 3:  Nuclear Reactor Sites throughout the \nUnited States and Nationwide Railroad Network \n \n \n \n\n243 \n \nFigure 4:  Nuclear Transportation Figures from the \nISP FEIS.  CISF Facility is depicted by red star.  \nTop:  Decommissioned Nuclear Waste Sites in the \nUnited States (Figure 2.2-4).  Bottom:  Location of \nRailroads in West Texas and Southeastern New Mex-\nico (Figure 2.2-7) (NRC 2021)  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n244 \n \n \n \n \n\n245 \n \nFigure 5:  Sensitive Receptors Close to the ISP CISF \nand Regional Railroad Network \nAs New Mexico Governor Grisham accurately critiques \nin her letter to NRC, the transportation of spent nu-\nclear fuel across the nation to CISF facilities is complex \nand extremely dangerous (Grisham 2020).  Safe trans-\nportation of spent nuclear fuel requires both well-main-\n\n246 \n \ntained infrastructure and highly specialized emergency \nresponse equipment and personnel that can respond \nquickly to an incident at the facility or on transit routes.  \nRoutes have to be agreed upon, weight capacity limits \nfor existing rail systems need to be addressed, local first \nresponders (emergency and medical) across the country \nhave to be trained, and critical infrastructure and equip-\nment need to be designed and deployed.  Even with \nwell-maintained infrastructure and best practices, some \nspent nuclear fuel in storage is not fit for transport. \nSections 3.3.2 and 4.3 of the FEIS indicate that prior \ntransportation analyses including the final State Envi-\nronmental Impact Report (SEIR) for Yucca Mountain \nand NRC\u2019s NUREG-2125 risk assessment provide suf-\nficient information about potential transportation routes \nto support the analysis of transportation impacts.  The \nNRC evaluation considers the routes evaluated in these \nprior transportation analyses to be representative or \nbounding for SNF shipments to and from the proposed \nISP CISF project because they were derived based on \ntypical transportation industry route selection prac-\ntices.  However, in comments on the draft EIS, the \nWestern Interstate Energy Board (WIEB) High-Level \nRadioactive Waste (HLRW) Committee (WIEB 2020) \nencouraged the NRC to fully evaluate all reasonable \nmodes and routes that could be used for nuclear waste \ntransportation to the ISP CISF and opined that opera-\ntional factors that should have been fully considered in-\ncluding: \n\u2022  An analysis of the effects of different transporta-\ntion operating protocols on shipment safety; \n\u2022  Of the level of emergency preparedness along \nlikely shipping routes; \n\n247 \n \n\u2022  Of requisite coordination and communication \nwith affected states, tribes, and other important \nstakeholders; and \n\u2022  An analysis of the impact on shipment numbers \nand safety of using any of the variety of transpor-\ntation casks that are licensed for use. \nThe WIEB HLRW Committee also stated that \u201cNU-\nREG-2125 is an obsolete and inapplicable reference for \nan environmental impact analysis of the ISP CISF.\u201d  \nNRC does not provide justification for disregarding this \nvalid criticism of their risk assessment procedures. \nThe WIEB HLRW Committee also offers valid evidence \nthat the existing railroad infrastructure and equipment is \ncurrently inadequate for the task of HLW transporta-\ntion to the ISP CISF facility noting:  \u201cthere would have \nto be enough railcars (assuming a mostly-rail transpor-\ntation system) to support this shipment rate, and the \nrailcars would have to be compliant with the Association \nof American Railroads (AAR) S-2043 standard.  As of \nnow, there are no manufactured railcars that are com-\npliant with this standard.  DOE\u2019s Atlas railcar design is \ncurrently being tested to certify its compliance with \nS2043, but this certification is not expected to be com-\nplete until 2022 at the earliest.\u201d \n2.6.2 Groundwater \nThe FEIS arbitrarily identifies a 20-mile cumulative \nimpact evaluation radius for groundwater from the ISP \nProject.  The FEIS further states that, of the nuclear \nfacilities in the region only the existing Waste Control \nSpecialists (WCS) facility, National Enrichment Facil-\nity (NEF), and Eden Radioisotopes are within the 20-\nmile groundwater study area.  By arbitrarily limiting \n\n248 \n \nthe study area dimensions, thorough evaluation of cu-\nmulative impacts of ISP and other past, present, and \nreasonably foreseeable projects to groundwater re-\nsources are precluded.  As the Permian Basin Coalition \nand Fasken Land and Minerals\u2019 previous comments on \nthe ISP draft EIS (PBLRO & FLML 2020) noted, the ge-\nographic formation (Central Basin Platform) is heavily-\nfaulted and the Project\u2019s seismic hazard analysis was \ndeficient.  The PBLRO/FLML letter also calls attention \nto the ISP environmental analyses\u2019 failure to mention \nand characterize the Rio Grande Rift (RGR), which it \ncharacterizes as critical in understanding the geological \nand geohydrological history of the aquifers at the CISF \nand potential risks to groundwater resources and seis-\nmology (PBLRO/FLML 2020).  In light of the analysis\u2019 \narbitrarily limited spatial scale in a region of obvious \nseismic risk, evaluation of cumulative impacts to \ngroundwater resources is clearly inadequate. \n2.6.3 Wildlife (Ecology) \nOnce again, the FEIS arbitrarily identifies a small, 5-\nmile cumulative impact evaluation radius for wildlife \nfrom ISP Project.  NRC states that their ecological cu-\nmulative impacts analysis is \u201climited to this radius be-\ncause ecological resources are not anticipated to influ-\nence or to be influenced by the proposed CISF project \noutside of this area.\u201d  This statement is not supported \nby any real scientific evidence and does not consider the \nwide ranges of several species with the potential to oc-\ncur onsite.  Migratory birds would most certainly be im-\npacted outside of a 5-mile radius from the project, along \nwith any highly mobile species. \nWe discuss two species with wide-reaching ranges that \nwere not examined thoroughly as part of the ecological \n\n249 \n \ncumulative impacts analysis:  the endangered northern \nAplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis), and \na regionally important game species, the pronghorn an-\ntelope (Antilocapra americana).  Both species have a \nmuch wider reaching range than five miles, which is not \ncaptured by the FEIS cumulative impact radius (FIG-\nURE 6). \nFigure 6:  Current Species Ranges for Northern \nAplomado Falcon and Pronghorn Antelope \n\n250 \n \nNorthern Aplomado Falcon \nThe U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) regu-\nlates the \u2018take\u2019 of federally-listed threatened and endan-\ngered species.  One federally-listed endangered species \nhas a known range that includes the ISP Project site \nand surrounding environs (FIGURE 7).  The northern \nAplomado is a federally-listed Endangered Species with \nmapped range in western Texas and eastern New Mex-\nico and a published Recovery Plan (USFWS 1990).  The \nESA has a recovery standard:  in other words, the goal \nof the ESA is to recover a listed species to the point at \nwhich it can be delisted.  This project, as well as other \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable future pro-\njects in the region would together have cumulative im-\npacts across a fairly substantial part of the historical \nformer range of the species precluding the recovery of \nthe species.  Since this project is located within the spe-\ncies\u2019 historic range, it follows that destruction of habitat \nwould inhibit the recovery of this species and potential \nfuture delisting.  The FEIS does not evaluate or ad-\ndress the recovery plan currently in place for this spe-\ncies and needs a more thorough analysis of the ESA re-\nlating to the northern Aplomado falcon. \n \n \n\n251 \n \nFigure 7:  Predicted Habitat Map, Northern \nAplomado Falcon (USGS GAP 2021) \nPronghorn antelope \nSimilarly, the pronghorn antelope is a highly migratory \ngame species which ranges across the southwestern \nU.S.  It is an important, state-managed game species in \nboth Texas and New Mexico which attracts hunters and \nwildlife enthusiasts to the region.  Because of this, the \nherds of pronghorn antelope possess interstate com-\nmerce value as harvestable game.  The proposed pro-\nject, as well as other past, present, and reasonably fore-\nseeable future projects (and their freight and construc-\ntion traffic) would result in fragmentation of pronghorn \n\n252 \n \nantelope range and loss of habitat connectivity, poten-\ntially affecting the management and viability of herds \nmigrating in both states.  Habitat fragmentation and cu-\nmulative project impacts to migratory corridors for \npronghorn antelope and other wide-ranging species are \nnot discussed in the FEIS. \n2.6.4 Climate Change \nThe FEIS evaluates climate change as part of air qual-\nity impacts (NRC 2021, Section 3.7.1.1 and Section 4.7.2).  \nHowever, climate change does not solely impact atmos-\npheric processes or the abiotic environment.  All species \n(humans included) will have to adjust their behavior and \nrange in response to climate or perish.  Cumulative im-\npacts of the ISP Project and other past, present, and \nreasonably foreseeable future projects on land use must \nbe evaluated in tandem with reduced agricultural pro-\nductivity of cropland and rangeland in the west Texas / \neastern New Mexico region resulting from anthropo-\ngenic climate change.  Similarly, the analysis of cumu-\nlative impacts of the ISP Project and other past, pre-\nsent, and reasonably foreseeable projects (notably highly \nconsumptive mining and oil and gas production facili-\nties) on groundwater resources and their sustainability \nmust acknowledge growing uncertainty related to pre-\ncipitation patterns, drought intensity, and other projec-\ntions identified in Section 3.7.11. \nAdditionally, NRC (and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-\nvice [USFWS]) should take shifting species distribu-\ntions resulting from climate change into consideration \nwhen evaluating the cumulative impacts of current and \nreasonably foreseeable future projects on federally-\nlisted and potential candidate species. \n \n \n\n253 \n \n2.7 Mitigation Planning:  Insufficient \nOne of the main stated purposes of NEPA is to \u201cpro-\nmote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to \nthe environment and biosphere\u201d (42 USC \u00a7 4321).  This \nis generally accomplished through mitigation measures, \nsuch as restoration, avoidance of habitat, and/or reduc-\ntion of harm.  Monitoring is also an important factor to \ndetermine mitigation success, so any mitigation strat-\negy needs to also include a robust monitoring program. \nMitigation planning is a critical part of the NEPA pro-\ncess; however, I find the NRC\u2019s mitigation strategy \nlacking in several areas, including: \n\u2022  No timeline for execution of mitigation; \n\u2022  Proposed mitigation is not the responsibility of \nthe lead agency (NRC); and \n\u2022  No probability analysis of mitigation implemen-\ntation. \n2.7.1 Nonexistent Mitigation Timeline \nAll the mitigation measures provided by NRC appear to \nbe deferred actions (as in, mitigation for project impacts \nis proposed but not evaluated further within a project \ntimeline).  No timeline is clearly stated in the document \nas to when mitigation would occur, and whether or not \nmitigation would delay or change their construction \ntimeline.  As an example, for surface water resources \nISP proposes mitigation through \u201ccompliance with the \nConstruction General Permit requirements and a \nStorm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)\u201d \n(NRC 2021) However, ISP does not indicate when this \nSWPPP would be developed.  NRC appears to push all \nmitigation (voluntary or required) to the future, thus \n\n254 \n \nthorough evaluation of proposed mitigation is not pre-\nsented. \n2.7.2 Mitigation Outside of Lead Agency Jurisdiction \nTime and again in the FEIS, NRC indicates that per-\nmits and plans will be developed for the project which \nwill identify future mitigation requirements. \nFor project-related impacts and cumulative impacts to \ngeology and soils, ecological resources, groundwater, \nsurface water, and logically public health and other is-\nsues NRC indicates that mitigation measures and Texas \nPollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) per-\nmit requirements (including spill prevention and clean-\nup plans) would limit soil loss, avoid soil contamination, \nand minimize stormwater runoff impacts.  For impacts \nto surface waters and wetlands, NRC indicates that the \napplicant would develop and implement a Stormwater \nPollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).  Meanwhile, a \nTPDES industrial stormwater permit would set limits \non the amounts of pollutants entering ephemeral drain-\nages. \nSimilarly, during the operations phase of the ISP Pro-\nject, the applicant would be expected to implement a \nSpill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) \nPlan to minimize the impacts of potential soil contami-\nnation, and stormwater runoff would be regulated un-\nder TPDES permit requirements. \nThis reliance on TPDES general construction permit, \nindustrial stormwater permit, SWPPP, SPCC, and \nother plans and permits represents a whole suite of mit-\nigation measures outside of the jurisdiction of NRC \nwhere enforcement would become the responsibility of \n\n255 \n \nthe State of Texas / Texas Commission on Environmen-\ntal Quality (TCEQ) or other responsible parties. \n2.7.3 Probability of Mitigation Unclear \nNEPA guidance stipulates that if a mitigation measure \nis not within the jurisdiction of the Lead Agency that the \nprobability of implementation needs to be discussed: \n\u201c[T]hus the EIS and the Record of Decision should \nindicate the likelihood that such measures will be \nadopted or enforced by the responsible agencies.  \nSections 1502.16(h), 1505.2.  If there is a history of \nnonenforcement or opposition to such measures, the \nEIS and Record of Decision should acknowledge \nsuch opposition or nonenforcement.  If the necessary \nmitigation measures will not be ready for a long pe-\nriod of time, this fact, of course, should also be rec-\nognized\u201d (46 FR 18026, March 23, 1981). \nThe ISP FEIS makes no determination of the likelihood \nof mitigation implementation by other responsible par-\nties, therefore there is not adequate assurance (or en-\nforcement) that the identified mitigation will be imple-\nmented as described.  In this respect, the language of \nSection 6.3 of the FEIS is incomplete and inadequate. \nThis is concerning, especially considering NRC will not \nbe responsible for this facility beyond approval and li-\ncensing.  As an example, the FEIS assumes emergency \nresponse actions will be mitigated through coordination \nwith local authorities, fire departments, medical facili-\nties, and other emergency services before operations \nbegin (NRC 2021, page 6-11).  NRC also acknowledges \nthat any first responders will require additional train-\ning and equipment to handle an emergency involving \nhighly radioactive nuclear waste but did not evaluate \n\n256 \n \nthese or the costs of such actions any further.  NRC \nstates that: \n\u201cISP did not provide a detailed estimate of the addi-\ntional training and equipment that would be neces-\nsary to respond to an incident at the proposed CISF \nproject that are not currently available to first re-\nsponders, and local agencies nor officials have not \nconducted studies with this type of information.  \nTherefore, a detailed analysis of the costs associated \nwith these potential additional resources are not \nevaluated in detail in this EIS\u201d (NRC 2021, page 4-\n74). \nNo such analysis in the FEIS is an obvious and glaring \nomission in evaluating the facility\u2019s operations and \ndemonstrates once again that NRC is not carefully con-\nsidering the impacts this facility will have on local com-\nmunities.  NRC is placing both the burden and cost of \nrisk management onto local authorities, without assur-\ning that those entities are well-informed of the respon-\nsibilities, costs, and risks, to approve, monitor, and en-\nforce these mitigation actions.  These omissions are fur-\nther examples of systemic problems and persistently in-\nadequate analyses throughout the FEIS, and further \nevidence of NRC\u2019s failure to take a \u201chard look\u201d at im-\npacts in violation of NEPA. \n2.8 Public Input:  Dismissed or Ignored \nThere is very high public and private interest in this \nproject, with the public raising several valid concerns \non both the project itself and the NEPA process.  NRC \ninitially received almost 29,300 comments during their \n2016-2018 scoping period (NRC 2020).  Responses to \nspecific sections from the public included: \n\n257 \n \n\u2022  Transportation:  safety/accident increases, radia-\ntion dose to citizens near rail lines; \n\u2022  Geology:  induced seismicity from activities; \n\u2022  Water Resources:  water is located near the sur-\nface, potential contamination of the Ogallala Aq-\nuifer; \n\u2022  Location/Land Use:  facility is located within an \nexisting waste storage facility, other collocated \nactivities; \n\u2022  Socioeconomics:  Greater impact on New Mexico \nsince the site is directly adjacent to its border; \nand \n\u2022  Environmental Justice:  disproportionate im-\npacts on Hispanic populations (NRC 2020). \nIn its FEIS, NRC categorizes the public comments into \nmajor sections and summarizes their response to the \ngeneralized comments, presented in D.2 of the FEIS.  \nFor every comment section, the NRC justifies their re-\nsponse and made virtually no changes or edits to the \nFEIS in response to public input.  This is alarming, es-\npecially considering the wide range of concerns the pub-\nlic raised in response to the proposed facility.  NRC\u2019s \ndismissal of the public points even closer to a predeter-\nmined outcome of this evaluation\u2014to permit a highly \nrisky facility quickly and without approval for the peo-\nple most impacted by its operations. \nOf note, the site selection process for the Andrews \nCISF facility required public input and consent.  How-\never, NRC decided that they had sole purview over this \ndecision and did not seek public input on alternative \nsites.  NRC relied solely on ISP\u2019s assessment process \nand did not perform any additional due diligence or con-\n\n258 \n \nsult with the public in the area.  Public comments \npointed out that \u201cISP\u2019s site selection process was not \nrigorous and focused on political community input and \nlocation rather than environmental impacts\u201d (NRC \n2021, page D-42).  This shows a clear lack of concern for \nthe surrounding community and stronghold to put a fa-\ncility wherever the applicant (ISP) decides fit. \n2.9 Impact Analysis:  Not Robust for Several Categories \nAn agency preparing an EIS takes a hard look at the \nenvironment affected by a project, by dividing the \u2018af-\nfected environment\u2019 into several categories.  Impacts \nare then categorized into one of three terms defined by \nNEPA, based on the severity of the impact: \n\u2022  SMALL:  effects are not detectable or are so mi-\nnor that they neither destabilize nor noticeably \nalter any important attribute of the resource. \n\u2022  MODERATE:  effects are sufficient enough to al-\nter noticeably but not destabilize important at-\ntributes of the resource. \n\u2022  LARGE:  effects are clearly noticeable and are \nsufficient enough to destabilize important attrib-\nutes of the resource. \nNRC\u2019s evaluation of the affected environment deter-\nmined most impacts would be SMALL, with only two \ncategories (Ecology and Socioeconomic) potentially \nhaving MODERATE impacts (TABLE 2). \n \n \n\n259 \n \nTable 2:  Impact Evaluation of ISP\u2019s CISF facility. \nTaken from NRC\u2019s October 5, 2020, public comment \nwebinar (NRC 2020) \nAfter evaluating the FEIS and feedback from the pub-\nlic, I find it difficult to believe that most impacts would \nonly be SMALL.  As described above, many of these \nanalyses were constricted by application of an arbitrary \ngeographic scope of evaluation for cumulative impacts.  \nIf evaluated with a more appropriate radius for trans-\nportation, as an example, effects would at least be \nMODERATE, if not LARGE.  NRC seems to deliber-\nately obfuscate the environmental justice effects of the \nproject and does not make a decision if the impacts  \nfit into one of the three levels of significance.  Rather, \nNRC states that there would be no \u2018disproportionately \nhigh and adverse\u2019 impacts to low income or minority \ncommunities\u2014leading to the conclusion that impacts \ncould, in fact, be MODERATE or LARGE on all popu-\nlations in the area.  We discuss the ecological impacts \nfurther below in this document; however, based on our \n\n260 \n \nevaluation of both immediate and cumulative impacts, \neffects on ecological resources would be MODERATE \nand/or LARGE, especially for the two species discussed \nabove (the Aplomado falcon and pronghorn antelope).  \nThese final impact determinations are clearly skewed \ntowards a favorable outcome where impacts are only \nSMALL; both short-term and cumulative impacts \ntherefore require a new evaluation to determine which \nimpacts are not truly SMALL. \n3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL GAPS \nGreat Ecology is comprised of a team of several inter-\ndisciplinary ecologists.  As such, myself and my team \nevaluated the FEIS through the lens of the environ-\nment surrounding this project.  Water resources and \ngeology/seismology were not evaluated thoroughly for \ncumulative impacts, as discussed above.  In addition, we \nfound several deficiencies with the ecological resource \nanalysis, particularly related to impacts on resident and \nmigratory wildlife species.  The cumulative impacts of \nthe ISP Project and other past, present, and reasonably \nforeseeable future projects on two such species (north-\nern Aplomado falcon and pronghorn antelope) were dis-\ncussed above.  In this section, additional species and \nconcerns are discussed. \n3.1 Ecology \nThe project is located within High Plains Levell III \necoregion (CMEC 2019).  Previously surveyed habitat \nwithin the CISF project footprint includes: \n\u2022  230.5 acres of Mesquite thorn-scrub; \n\u2022  76.0 acres of Havard oak (Quercus havardii, also \nreferred to as shinnery oak) dunes; and \n\u2022  17.8 acres of maintained grassland (CMEC 2019). \n\n261 \n \nNRC states that the proposed project would result in \nthe destruction of 109 acres of mesquite scrub and the \ndisturbance of all shinnery oak dune habitat onsite (76 \nacres), resulting in total direct habitat impacts of at \nleast 185 acres (NRC 2021pages 4-40 and 4-42). \nBoth mesquite thorn-scrub and shinnery oak dunes \nwere identified in the FEIS and ecological survey with \nthe potential to support migratory birds and sensitive \nspecies (CMEC 2019, NRC 2021 page 3-38).  Mesquite \nthorn-scrub onsite was identified as suitable habitat for \nthe Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), a state \nthreatened species (CMEC 2019).  Shinnery oak dunes \nwere also identified as suitable habitat for dunes sage-\nbrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus) and lesser prairie-\nchicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), two species of \nconservation interest in both Texas and New Mexico \n(CMEC 2019). \nShinnery oak systems are a rare habitat type in the \nUnited States, with the geographic extent limited to \nsoutheastern New Mexico, western Texas, and western \nOklahoma (Peterson and Boyd 1998).  Species who oc-\ncupy these habitats are, in turn, often specialists and \nrare themselves\u2014as is the case with the dunes sage-\nbrush lizard and lesser prairie-chicken.  The U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service estimated approximately one mil-\nlion acres of habitat in 1982; by 2010, that number had \ndecreased to 600,000 acres (USFWS 2010).  This is an \napproximate 40 percent loss in shinnery oak dune habi-\ntat over time; this number is almost certainly higher \nbased on the widespread amount of development (and \nproposed development) in these areas, suggesting today \nmaybe only 400,000 acres remain. \n\n262 \n \nNRC reviewed ecological surveys and federal/state da-\ntabases and identified one federally protected species \n(the northern Aplomado falcon) and several species of \ninterest that could be impacted by the CISF project, as \npreviously discussed.  However, impacts to these spe-\ncies were not adequately evaluated by the FEIS, and/or \nother species of regional or state interest were not (but \nshould have been) evaluated.  Although many species \nidentified are not currently listed under the federal \nESA, they are on state endangered/threatened species \nlists and/or of conservation interest.  These species \nneed suitable attention and evaluation of impacts. \nBased on the information presented in the FEIS, I iden-\ntified the following deficiencies in ecological impact \nanalysis: \n\u2022  No thorough evaluation of the ESA with regards \nto recovery of the Aplomado falcon; \n\u2022  No alternatives or contingencies presented to ac-\ncount for potential future listing of endangered \nspecies (i.e., lesser prairie-chicken and dunes \nsagebrush lizard); \n\u2022  No analysis or presentation of destructive im-\npacts of habitat fragmentation on species; \n\u2022  No impact determination on interstate game spe-\ncies (pronghorn antelope); and  \n\u2022  No evaluation of additional sensitive species with \nthe potential to occur onsite. \nIndividual species and concerns surrounding their anal-\nysis are discussed further below. \n \n \n\n263 \n \n3.1.1 Northern Aplomado Falcon \nThe project site was identified within the habitat range \nfor northern Aplomado falcon, a federally- and state-\nlisted endangered species.  The falcon nests in aban-\ndoned nests created by other raptors; these inactive \nnests were observed onsite during the most recent eco-\nlogical survey (CMEC 2019).  The FEIS assumes that \nthe project will have no impacts on the Aplomado falcon; \nhowever, this analysis shows a very limited scope of \nevaluation under the ESA, in particular with respect to \nidentifying obstacles to species recovery.  This is dis-\ncussed further above as a deficiency in evaluating cu-\nmulative impacts under NEPA. \n3.1.2 Dunes Sagebrush Lizard \nA species of greatest conservation need in Texas, the \ndunes sagebrush lizard occupies shinnery oak dune hab-\nitat found onsite.  ISP has acknowledged that this spe-\ncies has been observed in the area northwest of the pro-\nposed CISF project area in past surveys; NRC there-\nfore assumes that this lizard may be present during the \nproject (NRC 2021, page 3-52 and page 4-40).  NRC \nacknowledges in the FEIS that \u201cthe project would po-\ntentially disturb or kill lizards during Phase 1 construc-\ntion, but not in sufficient numbers to affect the local \npopulations of these species\u201d (NRC 2021, page 4-40).  \nNRC recommends ISP implement several conservation \nmeasures within suitable habitat during the project \n(NRC 2021, page 6-8 through 6-9). \nFirst, the NRC does not provide any evidence that \ndunes sagebrush lizards harmed or killed would not be \nin \u2018sufficient numbers\u2019 to affect the local population.  \nAlthough no study yet exists on the exact population, \nthe estimated number of lizards is estimated between \n\n264 \n \n10,000 and 100,000, with a conservative estimate of one \nadult per hectare of suitable habitat (Hammerson 2007).  \nPrevious surveys in Texas have found dunes sagebrush \nlizards in all sites surveyed in Andrews County (n = 19; \nFitzgerald et al 2011); therefore, lizard populations are \nlikely higher in the County and more vulnerable to hab-\nitat threats.  Any impacts to their habitat will likely \nhave a major effect on this already rare species.  The \nNRC does not clearly define how many lizards could be \nimpacted by construction of the facility, nor does it ex-\nplain how killing lizards will \u2018not affect\u2019 the local popu-\nlation. \nThe dunes sagebrush lizard is not a migratory species \nand only occupies shinnery-oak habitat; any habitat loss \n(including loss resulting from this project) will have \ndramatic effects on the lizard populations in both Texas \nand New Mexico.  NRC is aware of this, stating that the \ndunes sagebrush lizard is \u201cnot a highly mobile species \nand is confined to small home ranges within the active \nsand dune-shinnery oak habitat type, between 0.044 to \n0.28 hectare [0.1 to 0.7 acre] in size\u201d (NRC 2021, page 4-\n40).  As a result of their small range, the dunes sage-\nbrush lizard is highly sensitive to fragmentation; a \nstudy in New Mexico found that these lizards were \nfound significantly less in fragmented areas, compared \nto unfragmented habitat (Walkup et al 2017).  In many \ncases, the study found zero dunes sagebrush lizards in \nfragmented habitat, where lizards had been present in \nprevious years (Walkup et al. 2017).  These effects are \nwell documented in literature, and the FEIS should an-\nalyze the foreseeable/cumulative effects of habitat frag-\nmentation on the lizard that, in their own admission, has \nbeen observed onsite. \n\n265 \n \nUSFWS has announced a 12-month finding review pe-\nriod to address listing the dunes sagebrush lizard on the \nESA.  The 12-month finding was expected as of July \n2021; however, USFWS has not released any further in-\nformation regarding listing as of this date.  As with the \nlesser-prairie chicken, The FEIS should include alter-\nnatives that prepare for any potential ESA listing (in-\ncluding the lesser prairie-chicken), and how this would \nimpact the project in the foreseeable future of the pro-\nject. \n3.1.3 Lesser Prairie-chicken \nA species of greatest conservation need in Texas, this \nbird also occupies shinnery oak dune habitat found on-\nsite.  An online mapper confirms that suitable habitat \nexists for the chicken onsite (SGP CHAT 2021).  NRC \nconcluded in the FEIS that the although the lesser  \nprairie-chicken is unlikely to occur or be disturbed by \nconstruction (NRC 2021, page 4-41), ISP should follow \nrecommendations to \u201cmonitor the listing status of the \nlesser prairie-chicken and enroll in the voluntary \nRange-Wide Conservation Plan\u201d (NRC 2021, page 6-8). \nSimilar to the dunes sagebrush lizard, the lesser prairie- \nchicken faces threats from shinnery oak dune habitat \ndestruction.  The chicken is currently managed region-\nwide under a voluntary program called a Candidate \nConservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA).  This \nvoluntary program follows the guidelines established in \na \u201cLesser Prairie-Chicken Range-wide Conservation \nPlan\u201d established for the region (2013).  Although the \nstated purpose of the program is to conserve and pro-\ntect the species, the CCAA has ultimately led to further \nhabitat destruction and not enough mitigation.  An eval-\nuation of the CCAA found that approximately 17,600 \n\n266 \n \nacres of restoration were complete from 2014 through \n2019, which was two percent of the stated goal in the \nLesser Prairie-Chicken Range-wide Conservation Plan \n(CBD 2021).  Additionally, a total of 17,478 have report-\nedly been mitigated; this equates to a 124-acre positive \ndifference between \u2018impacted\u2019 and \u2018restored\u2019 acres (CBD \n2021).  Clearly this plan is not enough to conserve this \nalready rare habitat type, and habitat destruction or \nfragmentation should be avoided to sustain the existing \nlesser-prairie chickens.  As with the lizard, NRC did not \nlook at shinnery oak dune habitat fragmentation im-\npacts as a direct threat to this rare species, a threat that \nhas been increasing over time. \nThere is also potential that the lesser prairie-chicken \ncould be listed under the ESA in the future; however, \nthe FEIS does not consider any alternative or contin-\ngency if any species becomes listed.  The lesser prairie-\nchicken is currently being reviewed by the USFWS for \nESA protection, with a public comment period ending \non September 1, 2021.  As currently written, the FEIS \nacknowledges that ISP will \u201cmonitor the listing status \nof the lesser prairie-chicken,\u201d since \u201cchanges could po-\ntential require consultation, permitting, or mitigation \nwith wildlife agencies in the future\u201d (NRC 2021, page 4-\n43).  Considering the lesser prairie-chicken was previ-\nously listed as a threatened species from 2014-2015 \n(USFWS 2021), it is reasonable to assume that the \nlesser prairie chicken could become listed again in the \nforeseeable future of this project.  This shows a failure \nby NRC to consult or cooperate with the responsible \nfederal agency (USFWS) regarding pending endan-\ngered species protection and critical habitat designa-\ntion; furthermore, NRC did not evaluate the impacts or \nconsult with USFWS should the shinnery oak dune hab-\n\n267 \n \nitat present at the site be designated as critical habitat.  \nThe FEIS should include alternatives that prepare for \nany potential ESA listing (including the lesser prairie-\nchicken), and how this would impact the project in the \nforeseeable future of the project. \n3.1.4 Texas Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) \nA state-listed threatened species in Texas, this lizard \noccupies mesquite habitat present onsite.  It is inter-\ntwined with the state, as it is the Texas state reptile and \nthe mascot of Texas Christian University.  Although not \nobserved during onsite surveys, their main prey source \n(harvester ants) were observed during surveys.  NRC \nacknowledges in the FEIS that \u201cthe project would po-\ntentially disturb or kill lizards during Phase 1 construc-\ntion, but not in sufficient numbers to affect the local \npopulations of these species\u201d (NRC 2021, page 4-40).  \nNRC recommends ISP implement several conservation \nmeasures within suitable habitat during the project \n(NRC 2021, page 6-8 through 6-9). \nAs with the dunes sagebrush lizard, NRC does not clearly \nstate what the \u2018sufficient number\u2019 of lizards harmed or \nkilled that would impact the population.  Horned lizard \npopulations are declining throughout the state, so the \nlizards are mainly found in West Texas (CMEC 2019).  \nAdditionally, their main prey source, the harvester ant, \nis in turn becoming increasingly rare due to competition \nwith nonnative fire ants (CMEC 2019).  In essence, the \nhorned lizard is most likely to exist within suitable mes-\nquite habitat and with harvester ants.  Both of these \nconditions already exist onsite; therefore, impacts to \ntheir habitat, and particularly their prey source, will \nlikely have a major effect on this beloved species.  The \nNRC does not clearly define how many lizards could be \n\n268 \n \nimpacted by construction of the facility, nor does it ex-\nplain how killing lizards will \u2018not affect\u2019 the local popu-\nlation. \n3.1.5 Pronghorn Antelope \nSuitable habitat for the pronghorn antelope was ob-\nserved within the project site.  Although not a listed \nspecies, the pronghorn antelope represents an impor-\ntant game species in both Texas and New Mexico.  The \nFEIS assumes that the project will have no impacts on \nthe pronghorn; however, this assumption does not thor-\noughly evaluate pronghorn game management across \nstate lines and related impacts on interstate commerce.  \nThis is discussed further above as a deficiency in evalu-\nating cumulative impacts under NEPA. \n3.1.6 Other Sensitive Species Not Evaluated in FEIS \nAlthough not a strict requirement under NEPA, the \nNRC\u2019s FEIS evaluated several species of regional con-\nservation concern, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard \nand lesser prairie-chicken.  However, the 2019 ecologi-\ncal survey identified several species with the potential \nto occur in the area, and that would be impacted by the \nproject.  It seems strange that NRC would selectively \npick which species to evaluate outside of scope and not \nothers.  One species in particular, the Western box tur-\ntle (Terrapene ornata), was identified in the ecological \nsurvey as a species of greatest conservation need and \nobserved onsite during surveys (CMEC 2019).  It seems \nincomplete, therefore, to only evaluate impacts to cer-\ntain sensitive species and not others.  As such, the FEIS \nshould have included an evaluation of the Western box \nturtle. \n \n \n\n269 \n \n4.0 SOURCES \nAbbott, G. 2020.

This ROD satisfies Section 51.102(a) of Title 10 \nof the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), which \nstates that \u201c[a] Commission decision on any action for \nwhich a final environmental impact statement has been \nprepared shall be accompanied by or include a concise \npublic record of decision.\u201d \nIn July 2021, the NRC staff issued a final Environmen-\ntal Impact Statement (FEIS) (NRC, 2021b) for ISP\u2019s \nlicense application to construct and operate a proposed \nWaste Control Specialists (WCS) CISF (ISP, 2018a, \n2018b, 2020a, 2020b, and 2021).  In the FEIS, the NRC \nstaff, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.91(d), sets forth its \nrecommendation, pursuant to the National Environ-\nmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA), regard-\ning the proposed action.  The NRC staff recommended \nthat, subject to the determinations in the staff\u200a\u2019s safety \nreview of the application, the proposed license be issued \nto ISP to construct and operate a CISF at the proposed \nlocation to temporarily store up to 5,000 metric tons of \nuranium (MTUs) [5,500 short tons] of spent nuclear fuel \n(SNF) for a licensing period of 40 years (NRC, 2021b).  \n\n289 \n \nThe NRC staff has prepared this ROD in accordance \nwith NRC regulations at 10 CFR Sections 51.102(b) and \n51.103(a)(1)-(4).  In addition, in accordance with 10 CFR \nSection 51.103(c), this ROD incorporates by reference \nthe materials contained in the FEIS (NRC, 2021b). \nThe Decision \nThis ROD documents the NRC staff\u200a\u2019s decision to issue \na license to ISP for the proposed WCS CISF in An-\ndrews County, Texas (NRC, 2021a).  The license author-\nizes ISP to construct and operate its facility as proposed \nin its license application and under the conditions in its \nNRC license. \nAfter weighing the impacts of the proposed action and \ncomparing them to the No-Action alternative, the NRC \nstaff, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.91(d), set forth its \nNEPA recommendation regarding the proposed action.  \nThe NRC staff recommended that, subject to the deter-\nminations in the staff\u200a\u2019s safety review of the application, \nthe proposed license be issued to ISP to construct and \noperate a CISF at the proposed location to temporarily \nstore up to 5,000 MTUs [5,500 short tons] of SNF for a \nlicensing period of 40 years.  The staff based its conclu-\nsion on (i) review of the ISP license application, which \nincludes the Environmental Report (ER) and supple-\nmental documents (ISP, 2018a, 2018b, 2020a, 2020b, and \n2021), and ISP\u2019s responses to the NRC staff\u200a\u2019s requests \nfor additional information (RAIs) (ISP, 2019a and \n2019b); (ii) consultation with Federal, State, tribal, and \nlocal agencies and input from other stakeholders, in-\ncluding public comment on the draft EIS; (iii) independ-\nent NRC staff review; and (iv) the assessments pro-\nvided in the FEIS. \n\n290 \n \nIn its safety and security review, the NRC staff deter-\nmined that the application met the applicable NRC reg-\nulations in 10 CFR Part 72, \u201cLicensing Requirements \nfor the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, \nHigh-Level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor-Related \nGreater than Class C Waste.\u201d  In issuing a materials li-\ncense to ISP for the WCS CISF, the NRC determined \nthat there is reasonable assurance that:  (i) the activities \nauthorized by the license can be conducted without en-\ndangering the health and safety of the public; and (ii) \nthese activities will be conducted in compliance with the \napplicable regulations of 10 CFR Part 72.  The NRC \nfurther determined that issuance of the license will not \nbe inimical to the common defense and security. \nBackground \nIn accordance with the NRC\u2019s NEPA-implementing \nregulations in 10 CFR Part 51, \u201cEnvironmental Protec-\ntion Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related \nRegulatory Functions,\u201d the NRC staff prepares a site-\nspecific EIS for the issuance of a license pursuant to 10 \nCFR Part 72 for the storage of spent fuel in an inde-\npendent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) at a site \nnot occupied by a nuclear power reactor (10 CFR \n51.20(b)(9)).  In this instance, the NRC\u2019s major Federal \naction is to decide whether to issue a license authorizing \nISP to construct and operate the WCS CISF for a 40-\nyear license term. \nThe WCS CISF would store up to 5,000 MTUs [5,500 \nshort tons] of SNF and Greater-Than-Class-C (GTCC) \nwaste, along with a small quantity of mixed oxide \n(MOX) fuel (collectively referred to as SNF in the FEIS \nand in this ROD), which would originate from commer-\ncial nuclear reactor facilities in the United States, for a \n\n291 \n \n40-year period at the site in Andrews County, Texas.  \nDuring operation, the WCS CISF would receive SNF \nfrom decommissioned and decommissioning reactor \nsites, as well as from operating reactors prior to decom-\nmissioning (NRC, 2021b). \nThe WCS CISF would be built and operated on an ap-\nproximately 130-hectare (ha) [320-acre (ac)] project \narea within a 5,666-ha [14,000-ac] parcel of land that is \ncontrolled by ISP joint venture member WCS in An-\ndrews County, Texas.  In addition, construction of the \nrail sidetrack, site access road, and construction \nlaydown area would contribute an additional area of dis-\nturbed soil such that the total disturbed area for con-\nstruction of the WCS CISF would be approximately 133 \nha [330 ac].  The project area would be located north of \nWCS\u2019s existing waste management facilities and con-\ntrolled by ISP through a long-term lease from WCS \n(NRC, 2021b). \nISP would store SNF in six existing dual-purpose can-\nister-based dry cask storage systems (DCSS) designed \nby TN Americas or NAC International.  The 6 DCSS (3 \nfrom TN Americas and 3 from NAC International) con-\nsist of 11 different SNF canisters and 5 different GTCC \nwaste canisters stored in 5 overpacks.  SNF is stored \nhorizontally in the TN Americas systems and vertically \nin the NAC International systems.  The TN Americas \nand NAC International DCSS listed in the FEIS have \nbeen previously approved by the NRC for independent \nstorage of SNF, GTCC, and a small amount of MOX \nfuel, pursuant to requirements in 10 CFR Part 72.  In \naddition, the NRC approved both the TN Americas and \nNAC International systems for storage of SNF trans-\nported in canisters pursuant to the requirements in 10 \n\n292 \n \nCFR Part 71, \u201cPackaging and Transportation of Radio-\nactive Material.\u201d \nPublic Comments \nOn November 14, 2016 (81 FR 79531), the NRC staff \npublished in the Federal Register a notice of intent to \nprepare an EIS and to conduct an environmental scop-\ning process.  The NRC staff invited potentially affected \nFederal, State, tribal, and local governments; organiza-\ntions; and members of the public to provide comments \nin the environmental scoping process and review.  The \ninitial scoping period closed on April 28, 2017.  During \nthis time, the NRC staff hosted four public scoping \nmeetings, one in Hobbs, New Mexico, on February 13, \n2017; a second in Andrews, Texas, on February 15, 2017; \nand two in Rockville, Maryland, on February 23, 2017 \nand April 6, 2017.  Following a suspension of NRC\u2019s re-\nview at the applicant\u2019s request, ISP submitted a revised \nlicense application in June and July 2018 (ISP, 2018a).  \nOn September 4, 2018 (83 FR 44922), the NRC staff re-\nopened the scoping period for the ISP license applica-\ntion.  The reopened scoping period closed on November \n19, 2018.  The NRC staff issued a scoping summary re-\nport in October 2019 (NRC, 2019). \nOn May 4, 2020, the NRC staff issued the draft \u201cEnvi-\nronmental Impact Statement for Interim Storage Part-\nners LLC\u2019s License Application for a Consolidated In-\nterim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel in An-\ndrews County, Texas\u201d (NRC, 2020). \nA 120-day comment period began on May 8, 2020, when \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pub-\nlished a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register \n(85 FR 27412) of the draft EIS to allow members of the \npublic and agencies time to comment on the results of \n\n293 \n \nthe draft EIS.  On July 22, 2020. the NRC staff ex-\ntended the comment period an additional 60 days to \nclose on November 3, 2020 (85 FR 44330).  Additionally, \nthe NRC staff held public meetings on October 1, 6, 8, \nand 15, 2020, to discuss the preliminary findings in the \ndraft EIS, with transcripts of these meetings available \nat the NRC public project webpage:  https://www.nrc. \ngov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/cis/waste-control-specialist. \nhtml. \nResponses to all public comments received during the \ndraft EIS comment period are included in Appendix D \nto the FEIS. \nAlternatives Considered \nIn its environmental review, the NRC staff evaluated \nthe environmental consequences of the proposed action \n(i.e., authorizing the construction and operation of the \nWCS CISF), and the environmental consequences of \nthe No-Action alternative (i.e., not licensing the WCS \nCISF).  FEIS Chapter 2, \u201cProposed Action and Alter-\nnatives,\u201d and Chapter 4, \u201cEnvironmental Impacts,\u201d pre-\nsent the NRC staff\u200a\u2019s evaluation and analysis of the en-\nvironmental impacts of the proposed action and the No-\nAction alternative that were considered, as well as those \nalternatives that were eliminated from detailed study \n(NRC, 2021b).  The NRC staff discusses the reasons for \neliminating these alternatives in Section 2.3 of the \nFEIS.  These alternatives included (1) storage of SNF \nat a government-owned CISF operated by the U.S. De-\npartment of Energy (Section 2.3.1); (2) alternative de-\nsign or storage technologies (Section 2.3.2); and (3) al-\nternative CISF locations (Section 2.3.3). \nAfter weighing the impacts of the Proposed Action, \ncomparing them to the No-Action alternative, and con-\n\n294 \n \nducting a safety and security review of the Proposed Ac-\ntion, the NRC staff determined that the NRC should is-\nsue a license for the proposed WCS CISF project.  The \nNRC staff based its decision on: (i) review of ISP\u2019s li-\ncense application (ISP, 2018a, 2018b, 2020a, 2020b, and \n2021), which includes the ER and supplemental docu-\nments, and ISP\u2019s responses to the NRC staff RAIs \n(ISP, 2019a and 2019b); (ii) consultation with Federal, \nState, tribal, and local agencies and input from other \nstakeholders, including public comment on the draft \nEIS (see Appendix D in the FEIS); (iii) independent \nNRC staff review; (iv) the assessments in the FEIS \n(NRC, 2021b); and (v) the NRC staff\u200a\u2019s assessments in \nthe Final Safety Evaluation Report (NRC, 2021c) for \nthe WCS CISF. \nMitigation Measures \nThe NRC has taken all practicable measures within its \njurisdiction to avoid or minimize environmental harm \nfrom the proposed action (license issuance).  The appli-\ncant has committed to a number of mitigation measures \nas described in Table 6.3-1 of the FEIS (NRC, 2021b).  \nAs documented in the FEIS, the NRC determined that \nimpacts to most resource areas would be SMALL (i.e., \nnot detectable or minor), with SMALL to MODERATE \nbeneficial impacts for local finance and MODERATE \nimpacts (i.e., sufficient to alter noticeably, but not to de-\nstabilize, important attributes of the resource) for veg-\netation, population growth, and employment (NRC, \n2021b).  The NRC is not imposing any license conditions \nin connection with mitigation measures for the licensing \nof the WCS CISF.  ISP is subject to requirements in-\ncluding permits, authorizations, and regulatory orders \nimposed by other Federal, State, and local agencies \ngoverning facility construction and operation.  ISP\u2019s \n\n295 \n \nmonitoring programs for the proposed project are de-\nscribed in Chapter 7 of the FEIS (NRC, 2021b). \nReferences \n10 CFR Part 51.

The NRC conducted detailed technical and envi-\nronmental reviews of the proposed facility.  In July \n2021, the staff published the Final Environmental Im-\npact Statement for the proposed facility.  On September \n13, 2021, the NRC released its Safety Evaluation Re-\nport and issued a license under Title 10 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations, Part 72, \u201cLicensing Require-\nments for the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear \nFuel, High-Level Radioactive Waste, and Reactor- \nRelated Greater Than Class C Waste.\u201d  The license au-\nthorizes ISP to construct and operate the Waste Con-\ntrol Specialist Consolidated Interim Storage Facility in \nAndrews County, Texas.  The license was issued pursu-\n\n300 \n \nant to the NRC\u2019s authority under the Atomic Energy \nAct of 1954, as amended, (AEA) based on the determi-\nnation that ISP\u2019s license application meets the stand-\nards and requirements of the AEA and the NRC\u2019s reg-\nulations. \nThroughout the review process, the NRC has worked \nhard to keep you and your staff updated on any devel-\nopments.  Prior to issuing the license, the NRC\u2019s Exec-\nutive Director for Operations spoke directly with your \nstaff on September 13, 2021, to inform them of the im-\nminent issuance of the license and to answer their ques-\ntions.  A formal letter from the NRC staff notifying you \nof the license issuance was also transmitted to your of-\nfice on September 13, 2021. \nWe appreciate your interest in and concerns about \nthis project.  We also value the strong partnership be-\ntween the NRC and the State of Texas under the Agree-\nment State program.

Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission, et al., No. 21-60743 \nDear Mr. Cayce: \nAt oral argument, counsel for Fasken mentioned \nthat the NRC\u2019s website identifies independent spent \nfuel storage installations, or \u201cISFSIs.\u201d  Oral Arg. Tr. at \n50:45-51:23.  The Court invited counsel to furnish that \ninformation in a 28(\u200aj) letter.  Id. 51:30-35. \nThe NRC\u2019s website contains a map showing twelve1 \n\u201caway from reactor\u201d ISFSIs in the United States.  \nhttps://www.nrc.gov/images/reading-rm/doc-collections/ \nmaps/isfsi.png (Attached as Ex. 1).  That \u201caway from \nreactor\u201d moniker is misleading, however, and all those \n \n1 The ten facilities referenced by counsel were based on an April \n2021 map (https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2111/ML21116A041.pdf\u200a). \n\n302 \n \nfacilities are materially different from what NRC li-\ncensed in this case. \nOf the twelve facilities, three are operated by DOE; \none, Private Fuel Storage (\u201cPFS\u201d), is the facility at is-\nsue in Bullcreek and was never constructed2; and GE \nMorris is the sui generis former reprocessing facility \ndiscussed in briefing.3 \nThe remaining seven privately operated facilities are \nassociated with and located at decommissioned, or de-\ncommissioning, reactors.  The NRC\u2019s description of \nthese facilities as \u201caway-from-reactor\u201d is an artificial \nregulatory construction based on the fact that the stor-\nage is the only remaining actively licensed operation at \nthe site.  See Proposed Rule, Regulatory Improvements \nfor Production and Utilization Facilities Transition-\ning to Decommissioning, 87 Fed. Reg. 12,254, 12,265 \nn.4 (Mar. 3, 2022); see also Final Rule; Licensing Re-\nquirements of the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Inde-\npendent Fuel Spent Storage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. \n74,693, 74,698 (Nov. 12, 1980) (similar under \u201cDefinition \nof the term \u2018Independent\u2019\u200a\u201d).  Notwithstanding the NRC\u2019s \nartificial regulatory label, these operations are still oc-\ncurring \u201cat the site of [a] civilian nuclear power reactor\u201d \nin the statutory sense, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10151(a)(1), even \nthough the reactor has been decommissioned.  The ISP \nfacility at issue in this case, by contrast, would be a new \nconstruction far from the \u201csite\u201d of any \u201ccivilian nuclear \npower reactor.\u201d \n \n2 PFS is the only other facility not associated with a decommis-\nsioned reactor and that contemplates consolidated storage of spent \nfuel from various reactors across the country.  Unlike ISP, the \nPFS license did not permit the storage of DOE-titled spent fuel. \n3 Texas Reply Br. at 12-13. \n\n303 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nKANNER & WHITELEY, L.L.C. \n \n  /s/ \nALLAN KANNER \nALLAN KANNER \nAnnemieke M.

Nuclear Regulatory Com-\nmission, et al., No. 21-60743 \nDear Mr. Cayce: \nOn behalf of Intervenor/Respondent Interim Storage \nPartners, LLC, this is a response to the letter dated \nSeptember 1, 2022, by counsel for petitioners.  That let-\nter forwarded to the Court an informational map from \nthe NRC\u2019s website showing the locations of NRC- \nlicensed spent fuel storage facilities, including at twelve \n\u201caway from reactor\u201d sites. \nAs we have explained, it is petitioners\u2014not the NRC or \nISP\u2014that are impermissibly reading unstated terms \nand conditions into the provisions of the Atomic Energy \nAct (AEA).  That Act has always unambiguously author-\nized \u201cpossession\u201d of the constituent elements of spent \nnuclear fuel (which are the most specifically-defined \n\n307 \n \nmaterials the NRC is authorized to regulate under the \nAEA).  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201(b); 2073; 2092; 2111; \nsee also 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693 (Nov. 12, 1980).  As we ex-\nplained at oral argument (recording at 39:14-39:40), \nTexas concedes that the AEA authorizes \u201cpossession\u201d \nof spent nuclear fuel for storage purposes (Tex. Initial \nBr. at 17 n.6), but argues that that authority must be \nlimited, under the AEA, to \u201cat reactor sites.\u201d  But, the \nAEA says no such thing.  Accordingly, as we described \n(ISP Br. at 26), well-settled principles of statutory in-\nterpretation require rejection of petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments. \nThe information submitted by petitioners confirms \nwhat we explained at oral argument (recording at 42:37-\n44; 44:26-45:07), namely, that the NRC\u2019s transparent, \nlong-established, publicly-exercised authority over such \n\u201caway from reactor\u201d storage of spent nuclear fuel under \nduly-promulgated regulations from 1980\u2014exactly the \nsame authority exercised by the NRC in connection \nwith ISP\u2019s license here\u2014governs at least a dozen sites \nall across the country.  Petitioners\u2019 quibbles with the \nnature of a handful of those sites do not call that fact \ninto doubt.  And, petitioners\u2019 shifting arguments are \nalso not well-founded\u2014they originally urged that an un-\nstated-but-implied limitation of the statute to \u201cat reac-\ntor\u201d storage should be imposed, but, now, necessarily, \ncontend that the exception should be expanded to also \nallow possession \u201cat a former reactor.\u201d  But, the AEA \ndoes not say that, either.  There is simply no textual \nsupport for the argued restriction upon which petition-\ners\u2019 lack-of-authority arguments depend. \n \n \n\n308 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ BRAD FAGG \nBRAD FAGG \nCounsel of Record for Intervenor \nInterim Storage Partners, LLC \ncc:  counsel of Record (via CM/ECF) \n\n309 \n \n                  UNITED STATES \nNUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION  \n        WASHINGTON, D.C. 20555-0001 \n \nSeptember 7, 2022 \nBY ELECTRONIC FILING \nLyle W. Cayce \nClerk of Court \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n600 S. Maestri Place \nNew Orleans, Louisiana 70130 \nRe: \nState of Texas v. NRC, No. 21-60743 \nDear Mr. Cayce: \nFederal Respondents respond to Fasken\u2019s letter of Sep-\ntember 1, 2022, asserting that NRC\u2019s list of away-from-\nreactor storage facilities on its website is \u201cmisleading.\u201d  \nFasken is incorrect, and its arguments confirm that pe-\ntitioners lack a statutory basis to differentiate between \nat-reactor and away-from-reactor storage. \nWhile it is true that some of the listed facilities are op-\nerated by DOE (and thus licensed pursuant to different \nstatutory authority, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5842(3)1), none is \ncurrently licensed to operate a nuclear reactor.  More-\nover, several of the facilities listed (including PFS and GE \n \n1 Section 5842 does not separately authorize materials licenses \nfor DOE.  It was for this reason (and not a lack of AEA authority \nto license private storage facilities, as Texas belatedly suggests in \nits reply) that NRC\u2019s Chairman suggested in 1979 that Congress \nexpand NRC\u2019s licensing authority. \n\n310 \n \nMorris) never were associated with reactors, and the op-\nerating licenses for several former reactor licensees\u2014\nHumboldt Bay, Rancho Seco, and Trojan\u2014have been \nterminated altogether.  Consistent with the materials \nlicense issued to ISP, NRC has issued materials li-\ncenses for these facilities pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2073, \n2092, 2093, and 2111, and in accordance with 10 C.F.R. \nPart 72. \nAs discussed in our briefs and at oral argument, the \nNRC has issued these materials licenses based on its \ndetermination, reflected in Part 72, that permitting on-\nsite or offsite fuel storage is \u201cappropriate to carry out \nthe purposes\u201d of the AEA.  42 U.S.C \u00a7 2073(a)(4); see \nalso id. \u00a7 2093(a)(4) (authorizing source materials li-\ncenses for use approved by Commission as aid to indus-\ntry); Federal Respondents\u2019 Br. 59-65; Supplemental Br. \n8. Petitioners attempt to artificially confine the agency\u2019s \nauthority to issuing licenses only for onsite fuel storage, \nbut no statutory language imposes geographic limita-\ntions on NRC\u2019s plenary and exclusive authority over the \npossession of this nuclear material. \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments would undermine the basis upon \nwhich the agency has been issuing away-from-reactor \nfuel storage licenses since 1980.  And neither Fasken \nnor Texas presented to the agency any assertion that \nthe agency has acted beyond its authority, thus confirm-\ning that the Court has no jurisdiction over such claims. \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully, \n \n \n \n  /s/ \nANDREW P.

The petitioners' textualist argument that the Hobbs Act requires a \"party aggrieved\" (one who participated in the agency proceeding) to seek review, and their reliance on *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.*, continues to be their strongest and most direct path to victory. This procedural \"off-ramp\" remains a highly probable basis for reversal, allowing the Court to sidestep the complex substantive issues.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My beliefs on the merits have been significantly updated. The previous observation of Idaho's brief shifted the balance toward the respondents; this new observation adds powerful counter-evidence for the petitioners while also dramatically amplifying the weight of the arguments for the respondents.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The core substantive dispute remains the petitioners' claim of broad licensing authority under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) versus the respondents' position that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) created an exclusive, comprehensive framework that implicitly precludes the NRC from licensing private interim storage. The arguments from Idaho's brief regarding broken federal promises and the risks of creating *de facto* permanent repositories remain a key component of the respondents' case.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Petitioners' Industry Support):** My prior uncertainty about whether the nuclear industry would support the petitioners has been resolved. The observation confirms that the **Nuclear Energy Institute, Inc.** (the industry's primary trade association) and **Holtec International** (a key company in the nuclear storage sector and applicant for a similar facility in New Mexico) have filed briefs in support of the petitioners. This provides a crucial counterweight to the states' rights arguments, likely introducing arguments about the practical necessity of interim storage to alleviate the burden on reactor sites, the technical safety and security of these facilities, and the massive economic costs of the federal government's failure to create a permanent repository. This strengthens the petitioners' case on the merits by framing their action as a necessary and safe solution to a pressing national problem.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Breadth of Respondents' Coalition):** The observation reveals that the opposition to the NRC's action is far more extensive than just Idaho. The respondents are supported by:\n        *   A multi-state coalition: **\"State of Utah and Six Other States\"** have filed a brief. This transforms the federalism argument from a single state's grievance into a coordinated challenge from a significant bloc of states, dramatically increasing the political and constitutional weight of the claim that the executive branch is overstepping its authority.\n        *   Bipartisan political opposition: A brief from Texas's U.S. Senators **Ted Cruz and John Cornyn** and a bipartisan group of House members shows that opposition within Texas is strong and crosses party lines, signaling to the Court that this is a core state sovereignty issue, not a partisan dispute.\n        *   Diverse ideological and local support: Briefs from the **Pacific Legal Foundation** (a libertarian group focused on limiting government power), **Beyond Nuclear, Inc.** (an anti-nuclear advocacy group), and the **City of Fort Worth** (a local government likely concerned with transport risks) demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the opposition. This broad coalition reinforces the respondents' Major Questions Doctrine argument by showing that the NRC's decision has vast political, economic, and safety implications that affect a wide range of stakeholders, suggesting it requires clearer congressional authorization.\n\n3.  **Resolution of Strategic Uncertainty & Overall Synthesis:** The amicus filings have clarified the battle lines for the substantive question. It is now the federal government and the nuclear industry versus a large coalition of states, bipartisan federal legislators from Texas, and a spectrum of advocacy groups.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** My overall prediction remains a slight lean in favor of the petitioners, but this is based almost entirely on the strength of their procedural argument. The contentiousness and high stakes of the substantive question may make the clean procedural reversal even more attractive to the Court. However, my belief about the outcome *if the Court reaches the merits* has shifted further in favor of the respondents. The sheer number of states and the bipartisan nature of the political opposition provide a powerful federalism and separation-of-powers narrative that will resonate strongly with several justices. The substantive question is no longer a toss-up or even a slight lean; it is now a major clash where the respondents appear to have assembled a more compelling and constitutionally significant coalition.",

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  Respondents \nhave no substantive response, but instead just com-\nplain that such a critique is \u201chyperbole.\u201d  Fasken Br. \n47; Texas Br. 23.  It\u2019s not\u2014it is spot on. \nFinally with regard to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra \nvires doctrine, respondents give short shrift to the du-\nbious origins of that doctrine even in the Fifth Circuit \nitself, as well as to the compelling weight of uniform \ncontrary authority.  See ISP Br. 20-22; NRC Br. 23-25. \nThose factors and authorities further confirm that the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s stated basis for hearing the petitions of \nTexas and Fasken was error. \nIII. The Atomic Energy Act Authorizes the NRC \nto License the Temporary Storage of Spent \nNuclear Fuel Away from a Reactor Site \nA. The Atomic Energy Act\u2019s provisions re-\ngarding the constituent radioactive ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel authorize the \nNRC to regulate spent nuclear fuel. \nIn its decision, the Fifth Circuit accepted the oft-\nrecited (and accurate) proposition that \u201c[s]pecial nu-\nclear material, source material, and byproduct mate-\nrial are constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,\u201d \nand then proceeded to base its statutory analysis upon \nAEA provisions addressing those constituent materi-\nals.  ISP App. 22a (citing Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 F.3d \n536, 538 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Respondents, however, \n\n11 \nhave decided to take a different tack: their AEA argu-\nments now are largely based on the fact that the term \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d was not separately defined in the \noriginal AEA, but was instead added in 1988 as part of \nan unrelated overhaul of the Price Anderson Act.  \nFasken Br. 24 (\u201cIndeed, Congress did not amend the \nAEA to add \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 as a defined term until \n1988.\u201d (citing Price Anderson Amendments Act \u00a7 4(b), \n102 Stat. 1069)); Texas Br. 25-26.5\nRespondents\u2019 arguments run headlong into Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & \nDev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983).  That case was all \nabout \u201cspent fuel,\u201d id. at 194, and, more particularly, \nthe metes and bounds of how much Congress had oc-\ncupied the field regarding the storage of spent fuel in \nthe AEA, for preemption purposes.  The Court based \nits decision on its analysis of the then-current version \nof the AEA, including the provisions regarding the con-\nstituent elements of spent fuel.  Id. at 207.  The Court \nalso highlighted that \u201cthe NRC has promulgated de-\ntailed regulations governing storage and disposal \naway from the reactor.\u201d  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 217 \n5 Fasken makes much of the fact that a subsequent regu-\nlatory definition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d includes \u201cother radioac-\ntive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d Fasken Br. 26-27 \n(emphasis omitted) (citing Final Rule, Licensing Requirements \nfor the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Stor-\nage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,700-01 (Nov. 12, 1980); \n10 C.F.R. 72.3).  That reference merely recognizes the existence \nof control rod elements and the like\u2014the packaging that holds a \nnuclear fuel assembly together\u2014which become irradiated with \nuse.  See, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 961.11, Appendix E, Section B.2.  More-\nover, materials \u201cmade radioactive by exposure to the radiation in-\ncident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d are, in fact, \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(1). \n\n12 \n(citing 10 C.F.R. Part 72).  The addition of a separate \ndefinition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d on which respond-\nents now place such heavy reliance, had not yet oc-\ncurred\u2014that was still some five years into the future.  \nAnd the recently enacted Nuclear Waste Policy Act did \nnot affect the preemption analysis.  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. \nat 219.   \nWhile the Court ultimately held that the chal-\nlenged state statute addressed economic matters re-\nserved to the states and was therefore not preempted, \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning offered definitive guidance on \nthe scope of the AEA.  The Court made clear that Con-\ngress had \u201coccupied the entire field of nuclear safety \nconcerns,\u201d and the NRC, given the already-existing \nstatutory and regulatory landscape under the AEA, \nhad exercised its authority \u201cto authorize the storage of \nspent fuel.\u201d  461 U.S. at 212, 218.  Indeed, a key prem-\nise of the Court\u2019s holding was that although the federal \ngovernment was responsible to develop and license \ntechnology for \u201cnuclear waste disposal,\u201d the state stat-\nute had not attempted \u201cto enter this field  * * *  occu-\npied by the federal government.\u201d  Id. at 219.  The main \narguments propounded by respondents regarding the \nAEA in this case, therefore, cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas.6\n6 Texas posits an analogy about erroneously concluding \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration can regulate water, be-\ncause it can regulate hydrogen-fueled planes with oxygen equip-\nment.  Texas Br. 38.  That misses the mark.  The more apt anal-\nogy would be one section of a statute criminalizing the possession \nof heroin, and another the possession of cocaine.  No one could \nseriously argue that merely mixing the two drugs together takes \none completely outside of the law.  Yet, that is the essential posi-\ntion of respondents here. \n\n13 \nB. Respondents are unable to proffer any \nplausible interpretation of statutory text \nto support what they say the law is. \nRespondents\u2019 definitional arguments reveal an-\nother fundamental flaw in their efforts to defend the \nresult of the Fifth Circuit: there is no sensible inter-\npretation of the statutes that leads to what respond-\nents contend the law to be.  Texas asserts that the \nNRC \u201ccannot license possession of spent nuclear fuel at \nall.\u201d  Texas Br. 40.  Similarly, Fasken asserts that \u201c[n]o \nAEA provision grants NRC express authority to issue \na license for storing spent fuel.\u201d  Fasken Br. 24.  But, \nat the same time, Texas admits that \u201cno one disputes \nthat storage facilities onsite are permissible; they \nmust be.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  Well, what statutory provi-\nsion provides that \u201cpermission\u201d?  Respondents do not \nsay. \nThe necessary flipside of respondents\u2019 arguments \nalso reveals their error.  If, as respondents contend, \nthe provisions of the AEA addressing the constituent \ncomponents do not authorize the NRC to issue a li-\ncense for the possession and storage of \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d then the AEA also cannot prohibit the possession \nand storage of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014you cannot have \none without the other.7  We would be in a state of na-\nture: the unavoidable implication of respondents\u2019 ar-\nguments is that ISP did not even need a license from \nthe NRC, and could have just constructed the facility \non its own.  It is hard to imagine a scenario more inim-\nical to what Congress expressly identified as the core \n7 The prohibitions upon possession without a license are \nat 42 U.S.C. 2077(a) (special nuclear material), 2092 (source ma-\nterial) and 2111(a) (byproduct material). \n\n14 \npurposes of the AEA.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), (b); \n2012(a); 2013(d).  The statute should be interpreted in \na manner that harmonizes those provisions, not cre-\nates such elemental conflicts.  E.g., Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts (\u201cReading Law\u201d) 181-182 (2012). \nC. Respondents\u2019 ejusdem generis-type inter-\npretations of the AEA are erroneous. \nNeither respondent tries to defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretive analysis of the AEA.  The court be-\nlow held that the only permissible licenses with re-\nspect to special nuclear and source material were for \n\u201ccertain types of research and development,\u201d ISP App. \n22a, based upon 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(1) and (2) and \n2093(a)(1) and (2).  The Fifth Circuit inexplicably \nfailed to account for subsection (a)(3) of both statutory \nsections, and failed to give any meaning to subsection \n(a)(4).  And with regard to byproduct material, the \nFifth Circuit misconstrued an inapplicable provision \n(42 U.S.C. 2111(b)) based upon internet-derived con-\nclusions involving not byproduct, but special nuclear, \nmaterial.  ISP App. 23a; see ISP Br. 37. \nRespondents, however, do try to construct post-hoc\nejusdem generis-type defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s re-\nsult, at least with respect to special nuclear and source \nmaterial. Fasken Br. 29-31; Texas Br. 26-28, 40-43.  \nThose efforts fail.   \nFirst, respondents cannot identify a supportable \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d that fits their needs.  That, alone, \nprecludes the ejusdem generis-type arguments of re-\nspondents.  E.g., Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. \n214, 225 (2008); Reading Law 209 (\u201c\u2018the enumeration \nof the specific items is so heterogeneous as to disclose \n\n15 \nno common genus.\u2019 With this type of wording, the \ncanon does not apply.\u201d (quoting Lord Macmillan, Law \nand Other Things 166 (1938)).  The specifically enu-\nmerated potential uses here include research and de-\nvelopment related to atomic energy ((2073(a)(1), \n2093(a)(1)), research or development related to medi-\ncal therapy or medical therapy itself ((2073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2)), and for \u201cuse in a license\u201d for certain isotope \nproduction facilities, and in nuclear power plants.  42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3).  Respondents have come \nup with an argued common attribute of \u201cproductive \nuse,\u201d which they say excludes temporary storage of the \nmaterials, even at reactor sites.  Fasken Br. 30; Texas \nBr. 28.  That, however, is a made-up restriction with-\nout any textual, historical, or other support, and is fur-\nther belied by the admission that \u201csome form of tem-\nporary, onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel inheres in \nthe use of nuclear fuel.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  If there is any \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d here (and ISP does not agree that \nthere is), the fact that the enumerated items include \nnuclear power plants would mean that regulation of \nradioactive materials that \u201cinhere\u201d to operation of \nsuch plants would fit comfortably within any reasona-\nble postulated commonality. \nSecond, whether or not one labels Sections \n2073(a)(4) and 2093(a)(4) as \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions, \nthose terms indisputably have to be given some mean-\ning.  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 596, 607-608 (2010); \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  Respondents\u2019 con-\nstructs fail to do so, and the better interpretation is to \nconclude that the provisions encompass the licensing \nof temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel at away-\nfrom-reactors sites.   \n\n16 \nIt is also important to give meaning to what Con-\ngress actually said about the duties of the NRC, which \nis that it was required to \u201cestablish by rule, regulation, \nor order, such standards and instructions to govern the \npossession and use of special nuclear material, source \nmaterial, and byproduct material, as the Commission \nmay deem necessary or desirable to promote the com-\nmon defense and security or to protect health or to \nminimize danger to life or property,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), consistent with the \u201cdevelopment, use, and \ncontrol of atomic energy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a),8 and \nwithout any locational limitation.  The restrictive con-\ntentions of respondents are irreconcilable with Con-\ngress\u2019s clear commands. \nIn short, respondents cannot defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s construction of the AEA, nor reconcile their ar-\nguments with Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 217, nor defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from Bullcreek, 359 F.3d \nat 541, and Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. \nNielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. 2004).  See \nalso, Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 964 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Which is perhaps why they have, \nnow, pivoted to relying primarily upon the NWPA for \ntheir merits-based arguments. \n8 These provisions are not, as Texas claims, mere empty \n\u201cpolicy statements\u201d that can be ignored for these purposes. Texas \nBr. 37-38, 41 (citing Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U.S. 28 (2019)).  Ra-\nther, they are commands and delegations that do not conflict or \noverride any operative language from the statute and quite inten-\ntionally leave the agency with flexibility to regulate.  This Court \nhas recognized that such provisions should be applied as written.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 & n.6 (2024).   \n\n17 \nIV. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not For-\nbid the NRC from Licensing Private Parties\u2019 \nTemporary Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nAway from a Reactor Site. \nRespondents \nfundamentally \nmisconstrue \nthe \nNWPA.  They erroneously contend that it is the \nNWPA, rather than the AEA, that must provide the \n\u201cstatutory authority to license ISP\u2019s private, offsite \nstorage.\u201d  Fasken Br. 17; Texas Br. 29-31.  That is just \nnot so.  E.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121 (NWPA \n\u201cgoverns the establishment of a federal repository for \npermanent storage [i.e., disposal], not temporary stor-\nage by private parties.\u201d).  It is true enough that peti-\ntioners \u201cdo not contend the NWPA authorizes ISP\u2019s li-\ncense\u201d (Fasken Br. 20), but that is because no one ever \nthought that the NWPA was enacted to do so.  And it \nwasn\u2019t, as confirmed by the text, structure, and legis-\nlative history of that law. \nRegarding the text: the Fifth Circuit held that the \nNWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the ISP license, ISP App. 30a, \nbut cited no statutory provision that says that.  Nor do \nrespondents.  There is none.  Fasken contends that 42 \nU.S.C. 10155(h) \u201cspecifically forbids\u201d private offsite \nstorage facilities (Fasken Br. 19), but that provision \ndoes not \u201cforbid\u201d anything at all.9  Rather, the provi-\nsion says \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d\u2014meaning the \nNWPA\u2014\u201cshall be construed to * * * authorize\u201d private \n9 42 U.S.C. 10155(h): \u201cApplication * * * Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, nothing in this chapter shall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or Federal \nuse, purchase, lease or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian power nuclear reactor \nand not owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d \n\n18 \nstorage facilities.  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  In \nother words, the provision limits the scope of the \nNWPA.  But the NWPA is not, and never has been, the \nsource of the NRC\u2019s licensing authority at issue here.  \nRespondents\u2019 position cannot be squared with the stat-\nute\u2019s words\u2014it would make no sense for Congress to \nsay that the law did nothing to \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cre-\nquire\u201d an activity if (as respondents argue) that activ-\nity was already altogether banned.  Respondents can \npoint to no statutory text whatsoever to support their \nmain substantive position. \nRegarding the structure: The overall purpose of the \nNWPA was to establish the federal government\u2019s re-\nsponsibilities for the permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Subpart A set forth a plan for a permanent \nrepository.  42 U.S.C. 10131-10145.  Subpart B deals \nwith an interim storage program by the federal govern-\nment, pending permanent disposal.  42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157.  That was a limited program, designed to help \nutilities manage spent nuclear fuel while waiting for a \npermanent disposal site, and\u2014significantly\u2014it ex-\npired by its terms in 1990.  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).  That \nis, there were a number of conditions and processes as-\nsociated with the program, including a requirement \nthat any utility desiring to participate execute a con-\ntract with the federal government \u201cno later than Jan-\nuary 1, 1990.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).   \nRespondents chiefly rely upon provisions within \nthat Subpart B.  Texas Br. 29-31; Fasken Br. 18 (citing \n42 U.S.C. 10152, 10153, 10154).  Importantly, how-\never, all of those provisions concerned the limited fed-\neral interim storage program in Subpart B, and there-\nfore can be properly understood only as \u201cpreconditions \n\n19 \non private generators for obtaining federal interim \nstorage.\u201d  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  It is plainly \nwrong for respondents to argue that those now-expired\nportions of Subpart B are, instead, the only potential \nsource of the NRC\u2019s current authority to license a pri-\nvate party\u2019s possession of spent nuclear fuel at all, an-\nywhere.  E.g., Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 299 (9th \nCir. 1991) (\u201cThe Act\u2019s restrictive language [in Subpart \nB] limits the requirements to the specific set of reme-\ndial storage agreements authorized by the Act itself.\u201d). \nRegarding the legislative history:  First, and im-\nportantly, the legislative history conclusively confirms \nthat Congress was fully aware that the AEA had been \ninterpreted and applied by the NRC to authorize off-\nsite storage of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  \nE.g., S. Rep. No. 97-282, at 44 (1981); see Bullcreek, \n359 F.3d at 542; In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, \nCLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, 400 (Dec. 18, 2002) (\u201cMem-\nbers of Congress clearly were well aware that \u2018other \nprovisions of law\u2019 authorized private [away-from-reac-\ntor] storage facilities, as the existence, and fate, of \nsuch facilities was discussed in congressional commit-\ntee debates.\u201d), & n.35, n.44, n.45 (citations omitted).10\nCongress, of course, is presumed to know the state of \nthe law when it enacts legislation, e.g., Edelman v. \nLynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 117-118 (2002), and \nhere that knowledge is unquestionable.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that the meaning of the AEA should be in-\nformed by the subsequent NWPA (Texas Br. 28) is fair \n10 In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, 56 N.R.C. at 399-\n410, cites and summarizes the voluminous relevant legislative \nhistory in a far more comprehensive manner than space will allow \nfor here. \n\n20 \nenough as a general proposition, but that proposition \ncuts squarely against respondents in this case.   \nSecond, with regard to the federal interim storage \nprogram invoked by respondents, the legislative his-\ntory reveals efforts to balance competing concerns \nabout the nature and scope of such a program. See \nS. Rep. No. 97-282 (1981); H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, pt. 1 \n(1982); 128 Cong. Rec. 28,032 (1982).  Sec-\ntion 10155(h), on which respondents heavily rely, went \nthrough drafts and debates which confirm that its ul-\ntimate role was to ensure that DOE would not take \nover private facilities to fulfill its NWPA responsibili-\nties, and that also make clear that utilities would not \nhave to exhaust potential off-site storage options to \ngain access to the federal interim storage program at \nSubpart B (which had been a requirement in some \nearly drafts).11  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 543.  Signif-\nicantly, however, \u201c[n]othing in those reports and de-\nbates suggests that Congress intended to prohibit pri-\nvate use of private away-from-reactor facilities.\u201d  Ibid.\nAlthough they avoided or disavowed it below,12 it \nis apparent that respondents\u2019 real argument is that \n11 See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, at 20 (1982), reprinted \nin part in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3792 (H.R. 3809, \u00a7 133(b)(1)(D)), re-\nported out of the House Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs on \nApril 27, 1982; Nuclear Waste Disposal Policy: Hearing Before the \nSubcomm. on Energy Conservation and Power of the House \nComm. on Energy and Commerce on H.R. 1993, H.R. 2881, H.R. \n3809, and H.R. 5016, 97th Cong. 2-3 (1982) (reference to \u201ctenta-\ntive agreement\u201d requiring generators to exhaust private offsite \nstorage as options in order to access federal interim storage). \n12 21-60743 State Pets. C.A. Br. at 24 (whether NWPA im-\npliedly repealed the NRC\u2019s AEA authority is the \u201cwrong ques-\ntion\u201d). \n\n21 \nthe NWPA silently repealed existing AEA authority, \nby implication.  Texas Br. 28, 43; Fasken Br. 21-23.  \nRespondents have not come close to clearing that high \nhurdle in this case.  E.g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 549 (1974).  The preexisting NRC authority under \nthe AEA to license private parties to store spent nu-\nclear fuel away from existing reactor sites was not \nmerely \u201cimplied,\u201d as Fasken argues.  Fasken Br. 22 \n(citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988)).  Rather, that AEA authority was demonstra-\nbly and indisputably known to Congress when it \npassed the NWPA, and formally enshrined in the Code \nof Federal Regulations after extensive notice-and com-\nment processes (which Texas contends \u201cprompted \nalarm,\u201d Texas Br. 3).  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542-\n543.  And, as explained above, there is no conflict \nwhatsoever, much less any \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d \n(Fasken Br. 22 (citation omitted)) between the AEA \nand NWPA with regard to the NRC\u2019s authority to li-\ncense private parties to temporarily possess spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Respondents\u2019 case for repeal by implication \nfalls woefully short. \nFinally, both respondents invoke West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  Fasken Br. 32-33; Texas Br. \n31, 35.  As petitioners have explained, however, the \n\u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine has no applicability to this \ncase.

Id. at 34. \n\n22 \nwheelhouse.\u201d Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 518 \n(2023) (Barrett, J., concurring).

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My belief state has been substantially updated by observing two new amicus briefs filed in support of the respondents by (1) the Permian Basin Petroleum Association and New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, and (2) the States of New Mexico and Michigan. This new information dramatically alters my assessment of the procedural question, transforming it from a likely \"off-ramp\" for the petitioners into a highly contested battleground with sophisticated arguments on both sides. It also adds new dimensions to the substantive question by introducing new economic stakeholders and detailing concrete harms.\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief that this was the petitioners' strongest path to victory has been significantly weakened. The new amicus briefs provide the first detailed, substantive counter-arguments I have observed on this issue.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' core argument remains that the Hobbs Act's \"party aggrieved\" language requires formal participation in the agency proceeding, a requirement Texas did not meet. This textual argument, supported by precedent like *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.*, is still a primary focus.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Doctrinal Defense of *Ultra Vires*):** The Permian Basin brief provides a robust historical and doctrinal defense of the Fifth Circuit's *ultra vires* exception. It argues the doctrine is not mere \"judge-made dicta\" but is rooted in pre-APA principles of equity and codified in the Administrative Procedure Act's provision for judicial review for a \"legal wrong\" (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702). Citing cases like *Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. United States* (1919), the brief argues that the Hobbs Act supplemented, rather than abrogated, these traditional avenues for challenging agency action in excess of authority. This provides a strong historical and structural counter-narrative to the petitioners' textualism.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Alternative Interpretations of \"Party Aggrieved\"):** The briefs introduce two critical alternative readings. First, that \"party\" in the Hobbs Act context simply means \"petitioner\"\u2014the entity filing for review in court. Second, and more powerfully, they argue that the NRC's own procedural rules create an \"impenetrable thicket\" designed to make formal intervention nearly impossible. This reframes the issue: if the Court accepts the government's narrow definition of \"party\" while the agency itself controls access to party status through prohibitive regulations, the NRC could effectively immunize its most consequential decisions from any judicial review. This argument about agency self-insulation is a powerful appeal to the judiciary's role in checking the administrative state and could resonate strongly with the current Court.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Non-Jurisdictional Nature):** The Permian Basin brief also argues that the \"party aggrieved\" requirement is a non-jurisdictional claim-processing rule, not a rigid jurisdictional bar. Citing recent Supreme Court precedent like *Harrow v. DOD*, it suggests that failure to meet the requirement could be excused in equity, especially if the agency wrongfully denied participation. This provides the Court with another, more flexible path to reach the merits.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief in the strength of the respondents' case on the merits has been further reinforced.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The fundamental dispute remains the petitioners' claim of broad licensing power under the AEA versus the respondents' argument that the NWPA's comprehensive scheme for a single, permanent repository implicitly precludes the NRC's action. The broad coalition of states and political figures opposing the license remains a key signal of the federalism and separation-of-powers stakes.\n    *   **Updated Belief (New Economic Stakeholders):** The observation of the amicus brief from the **Permian Basin Petroleum Association** and the **New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau** is highly significant. It reveals that opposition is not limited to state governments and anti-nuclear advocates, but now includes major regional economic interests\u2014oil, gas, and agriculture\u2014who view the facility as a direct threat to their property and business operations (e.g., by threatening freshwater aquifers). This adds a powerful new layer to the Major Questions Doctrine argument, demonstrating that the NRC's decision has vast economic consequences across multiple sectors, far exceeding the scope of the nuclear industry.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Concrete Harms and State Burdens):** The New Mexico and Michigan brief provides a specific, detailed list of harms and burdens that states would face, including the risks of aging storage canisters leaking, the threat of terrorism, the creation of *de facto* permanent dumps without consent, and the imposition of unfunded emergency response burdens. This adds tangible, real-world weight to the more abstract constitutional arguments about federalism, making the respondents' case more concrete and compelling.\n\n3.  **Resolution of Strategic Uncertainty & Overall Synthesis:** The new observations have fundamentally changed my view of the case's likely trajectory.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** The procedural question is no longer a clean win for the petitioners; it is now a complex administrative law problem where the respondents have multiple, plausible counter-arguments. The narrative that the NRC is using its own procedural rules to evade judicial review is particularly potent and ties the procedural and substantive issues together. My overall prediction has shifted from a slight lean for the petitioners (based on the procedural off-ramp) to a genuine toss-up. In fact, my belief is now that the respondents have a slight edge. The combination of a powerful federalism/separation-of-powers argument on the merits, supported by an exceptionally broad coalition (states, bipartisan legislators, industry competitors like oil/gas, and ideological groups), and now coupled with strong counter-arguments on the procedural question, creates a formidable case for affirming the Fifth Circuit. The Court may be highly skeptical of an agency action that appears to be a major policy decision made while simultaneously manipulating procedural rules to avoid accountability.",

However, the petitioners are a coalition of the private entity (ISP) and the federal government (NRC/USA). The arguments and framing presented by the U.S. Solicitor General are exceptionally influential with the Court. To complete my understanding of the petitioners' final rebuttal, I must now locate and analyze the reply brief filed by the federal petitioners. This will allow me to see if the government's arguments align with, differ from, or add to ISP's, providing a more complete picture of the case presented to the Court.

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the reply brief for petitioner Interim Storage Partners, LLC (ISP) has provided a significant counterweight to the respondents' and amici's arguments, substantially rehabilitating the petitioners' case on both the procedural and substantive questions. My belief state, which had shifted to favor the respondents, is now moving back towards the petitioners, as they have offered powerful, text-based, and precedent-grounded rebuttals.\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief that this issue had become a \"highly contested battleground\" is now updated. The petitioners have landed formidable counter-punches that restore this as their likely strongest path to victory.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The textual dispute over the meaning of \"party aggrieved\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344 remains the central procedural issue.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Reassertion of Textualism and Precedent):** ISP's brief forcefully rebuts the respondents' attempt to broaden the definition of \"party.\" It hammers the simple textual distinction Congress made by using \"party aggrieved\" instead of \"person aggrieved\" (as in the APA) or \"participant aggrieved\" (the respondents' preferred reading). Crucially, ISP frames this as a long-settled, multi-circuit consensus, citing then-Judge Scalia's opinion in *Simmons v. ICC* to lend historical and jurisprudential weight to their interpretation. This directly counters the narrative that the petitioners' reading is a mere formality.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Reframing from \"Agency Obstruction\" to \"Litigant Choice\"):** This is a critical shift in the narrative. Where respondents and their amici painted a picture of the NRC creating an \"impenetrable thicket\" to evade review, ISP counters that a \"full, fair, and well-established pathway to full judicial review\" existed. ISP argues that Texas *intentionally eschewed* this route for \"strategic reasons,\" while Fasken *did* use the proper channels for other claims and received full judicial review in the D.C. Circuit (which it lost). This reframes the issue from one of agency self-insulation to one of litigant error or forum shopping, a narrative that is likely to be far less sympathetic to the Court.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Direct Attack on the *Ultra Vires* Exception):** ISP directly attacks the Fifth Circuit's *ultra vires* doctrine, which the respondents' amici had defended. ISP characterizes it as a \"long-dormant outlier doctrine, originally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and unworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by every other circuit.\" Most importantly, ISP argues it is inapplicable here by citing *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.* for the principle that such extraordinary jurisdiction is unavailable when an adequate statutory path for review exists\u2014which the Hobbs Act provides. This directly undermines the historical and doctrinal props for the Fifth Circuit's decision.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief in the strength of the respondents' case on the merits is now tempered by ISP's focused, textualist counter-arguments.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The core conflict between the AEA's broad licensing authority and the NWPA's specific scheme for a permanent federal repository remains. The political significance of the broad coalition opposing the license is unchanged.\n    *   **Updated Belief (NWPA as Non-Prohibitory):** ISP's primary substantive argument is a classic textualist move: they challenge respondents to \"identif[y] any statutory text\" in the NWPA that *forbids* the NRC from licensing private interim storage. This reframes the entire debate. Instead of the NWPA implicitly repealing or occupying the field of the AEA, ISP argues the NWPA simply governs the federal government's separate obligation to build a permanent repository, leaving the NRC's pre-existing AEA authority over private actors intact.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Affirmative AEA Authority and Precedent):** ISP asserts that its interpretation is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in *Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.* and that the AEA's provisions on constituent radioactive materials provide a clear basis for its authority. By arguing that the Fifth Circuit's decision is at odds with \"multiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth Circuit,\" ISP paints the lower court as a rogue actor creating a circuit split.\n\n3.  **Resolution of Strategic Uncertainty & Overall Synthesis:** This observation has reversed the momentum I previously detected. The petitioners' reply brief effectively dismantles the narrative of agency overreach and obstruction, recasting it as a case of litigant error and a circuit court departing from established text, precedent, and inter-circuit consensus.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** My prediction has shifted from a slight lean for the respondents back to a slight lean for the **petitioners**. The procedural question, which had seemed complicated, now appears much cleaner and more favorable to the petitioners. The argument that Texas simply failed to follow the rules is straightforward and avoids the complex doctrinal questions of the *ultra vires* exception. A court inclined towards procedural regularity and textualism has a clear path to reverse on these grounds alone. The petitioners have successfully framed the case as a choice between upholding a clear statutory scheme (*Simmons*, *MCorp*) versus endorsing an \"outlier\" and \"unworkable\" judicial exception to benefit a litigant who failed to use the proper channels. This is a powerful framing for seeking reversal.",

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.

Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac.

With respect to each and every \none of them, the Fifth Circuit stands alone.   \nAs a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit should \nnever have entertained the petitions of Texas and \nFasken at all.  Respondents primarily seek to defend \nthe exercise of jurisdiction by reference to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s dicta that jurisdiction could be supported un-\nder the Hobbs Act.  Not so, for multiple reasons.  Per-\nhaps most fundamentally, the actual Hobbs Act says \n\u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Not, as respond-\nents would have it, \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved.  Texas Br. \n12 (arguing for \u201creading the word \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018par-\nticipant\u2019\u200a\u201d); Fasken Br. 38 (arguing that the \u201cstatutory \nrequirement\u201d is \u201cparticipation\u201d).  Even by 1983, appli-\ncation of the statutory \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement \nenjoyed \u201cpresumptive validity conferred by a decade of \nacceptance in this and other circuits,\u201d Simmons v. ICC, \n716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.), and that \nsettled validity had only increased over the ensuing \ntwo-plus decades of uniform applications by the courts \nof appeals.  Until the Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary, and in-\ncorrect, dicta in this case. \nIn the Hobbs Act, Texas and Fasken had available \nto them a full, fair, and well-established pathway to \nfull judicial review for all of the claims they attempted \nto assert at the Fifth Circuit, but they intentionally es-\nchewed that route, apparently for strategic reasons.  \nThat fact distinguishes these circumstances from \nevery one of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d authorities \nupon which respondents rely.  That fact also reveals \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d \n\n2 \njurisdiction in this case for what it was: judicial over-\nreach based upon a long-dormant outlier doctrine, \noriginally based upon dubious dicta, arbitrary and un-\nworkable in practice, and persuasively rejected by \nevery other circuit court that has ever looked at it.  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s exercise of so-called \u201cultra vires\u201d juris-\ndiction should be reversed. \nOn the issue of whether the NRC had authority to \ndo what it did here, respondents\u2019 construction of the \nAtomic Energy Act cannot be reconciled with this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State En-\nergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 \n(1983).  Respondents\u2019 arguments also violate multiple \nelemental principles of statutory interpretation, lead \nto obviously incorrect results, and are at odds with \nmultiple well-reasoned authorities outside of the Fifth \nCircuit.  \nRespondents\u2019 invocation of the Nuclear Waste Pol-\nicy Act (\u201cNWPA\u201d) fares no better.  They still have not \nidentified any statutory text to support the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding that the NWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the li-\ncensing of temporary possession of spent nuclear fuel \nby a private party at an away-from-reactor site.  ISP \nApp. 30a.  Respondents fundamentally misconstrue \nthe text, structure, and purposes of the NWPA, and, \nagain, fail to justify the departure that they urge from \nwell-reasoned and uniform contrary precedent outside \nof the Fifth Circuit.   \nFor all of these reasons, the judgment of the Fifth \nCircuit should be reversed, and the Fifth Circuit \nshould be directed to dismiss or deny the petitions. \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nNeither Texas Nor Fasken Was a \u201cParty Ag-\ngrieved\u201d Under the Hobbs Act \nThe language used by Congress in the Hobbs Act \ncontrols: it says \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344 (em-\nphasis supplied).  Not \u201cparticipant\u201d aggrieved, contra\nTexas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 38, and not \u201cperson\u201d ag-\ngrieved, as in the Administrative Procedure Act \npassed just four years prior.  5 U.S.C. 702.  Congress\u2019s \n\u201capparently intentional\u201d reference to a \u201cparty\u201d in the \nHobbs Act must be given meaning, as then-Judge \nScalia noted decades ago, and effectively means what \n\u201cparty\u201d means in \u201cappeals from district court deci-\nsions.\u201d  See Simmons v. ICC, 716 F.2d 40, 43 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); see also In re Chi., Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pac. \nR.R., 799 F.2d 317, 335 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, \nJ.).  Respondents\u2019 contrary view lacks textual or prec-\nedential support.  See Texas Br. 10; Fasken Br. 40-41.   \nWithout exception and for decades now, case after \ncase has held that, when Congress vested courts of ap-\npeals with jurisdiction to entertain challenges to cer-\ntain agency actions in the Hobbs Act, challengers who \nfailed to \u201cproperly intervene[\u200a] in the underlying NRC \nproceeding * * * are not \u2018part[ies] aggrieved,\u2019\u201d and \ntherefore may not seek judicial review under the \nHobbs Act.  Ohio Nuclear Free Network v. NRC, 53 \nF.4th 236, 239 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Gage v. Atomic \nEnergy Comm\u2019n, 479 F.2d 1214, 1217-1218 (D.C. Cir. \n1973); Packard Elevator v. ICC, 808 F.2d 654, 656 (8th \nCir. 1986); State ex rel. Balderas v. NRC, 59 F.4th \n\n4 \n1112, 1116-1119 (10th Cir. 2023).1  In most of those \ncases, the petitioners argued that they had sufficiently \nparticipated to make them \u201cparties\u201d (by, for example, \nsubmitting letters to NRC staff, Ohio Nuclear Free \nNetwork, 53 F.4th at 239)\u2014just as Texas and Fasken \nargue here.  To no avail.  And those cases were exactly \nright.  Unlike the Fifth Circuit\u2019s dicta in this case, the \nuniform contrary authority correctly applies the clear \nstatutory language of the Hobbs Act.2\nThis consistently applied interpretation is not at \nall undercut by the unremarkable observation that \nwhat is required to become a \u201cparty\u201d can vary depend-\ning on whether the agency proceeding is a rulemaking \nor an adjudication.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, 819 \nF.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That is merely ap-\nplying the words of the statute to the facts of the par-\nticular agency action at issue.  Respondents, on the \nother hand, want to upend settled law with a categor-\nical judge-made rule that ignores factual variations \n1 The single passing reference by this Court to \u201can ag-\ngrieved party\u201d in connection with a discussion of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 146 (1993), \nupon which Texas heavily relies (Texas Br. 10, 18), but which \nFasken does not cite, does not suggest the contrary.  Darby had \nnothing to do with Hobbs Act jurisdiction, but, instead, involved \nwhat the parties to that case agreed to be a \u201cjudicially created \ndoctrine of exhaustion.\u201d  509 U.S. at 138.   \n2 The judicial intervention provision in the Hobbs Act at \n28 U.S.C. 2348 further supports this conclusion, as ISP and the \nNRC explained, ISP Br. 25-26, NRC Br. 19-20, and as the Elev-\nenth Circuit held in Alabama Power Co. v. FCC, 311 F.3d 1357, \n1366 (11th Cir. 2002).  That provision draws a clear distinction \nbetween a \u201cparty\u201d to an agency proceeding (who may intervene in \na court proceeding as of right) and others whose interests are af-\nfected (who may only intervene with leave).  That underscores the \nsignificance of the use of \u201cparty\u201d aggrieved in Section 2344. \n\n5 \nand applies an undefined lowest common denominator \nin all circumstances, Texas Br. 12, Fasken Br. 41, but \nthere is no justification for such a departure.  Indeed, \nTexas imagines hypothetical difficulties and confusion \nif the Hobbs Act \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d requirement was to \nbe applied differently for a rulemaking and an adjudi-\ncation.  Texas Br. 15-16.  The legal principles as de-\nscribed by Texas, however, have in fact been the set-\ntled law in this country for many decades, and nothing \nlike the dire consequences portrayed by Texas have \ncome to pass.   \nWhat respondents (and several of the amici) really \nseem to be complaining about is that they do not like \nthe NRC\u2019s longstanding adjudicatory and intervention \nrules, and they even go so far as to contend that those \nrules \u201cpreclude appellate review.\u201d  Fasken Br. 41, 38-\n39; Texas Br. 12-13, 18-19.  Not so, at all.   \nFirst, and to be crystal clear: the straightforward \napplication of the NRC\u2019s adjudicatory hearing rules \nand the Hobbs Act does not somehow \u201cclose the court-\nhouse door\u201d to anyone.  The Hobbs Act indisputably al-\nlows judicial review, for \u201cparties aggrieved.\u201d  Texas \ncould have attempted to become a \u201cparty,\u201d as the reg-\nulations expressly provide, and as many other states \nhave routinely done in the past. See 10 C.F.R. 2.309(h); \ne.g., N.J. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Prot. v. NRC, 561 F.3d 132, 135 \n(3d Cir. 2009) (New Jersey).  But Texas chose not to.  \nFasken did try to become a party for other, separate, \nclaims, and actually had its day in court on those as-\nsertions, but lost.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich. v. NRC, No. 21-\n1048, 2023 WL 395030, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 25, 2023). \nSecond, respondents never challenged the legality \nof the NRC intervention regulations below.  They \n\n6 \ncertainly could have attempted to do so\u2014such chal-\nlenges have been made in the past.  E.g., Blue Ridge \nEnv\u2019t Def. League v. NRC, 716 F.3d 183, 196 (D.C. Cir. \n2013).  But the validity of those regulations is not pre-\nsented in this case.  This Court should not cast aside \nthe Hobbs Act merely because respondents, now, com-\nplain that complying with the NRC\u2019s hearing regula-\ntions would have been too onerous or \u201cfutile\u201d had they \ntried to invoke them.  Texas Br. 20.  E.g., F. Hoffman-\nLa Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 175 \n(2004) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals, however, did not ad-\ndress this argument * * *, and, for that reason, neither \nshall we.\u201d).3\nFinally with respect to the Hobbs Act, Fasken ar-\ngues that, because it \u201crequested a hearing\u201d with re-\nspect to certain of its claims, it is a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d \nfor all purposes under the Hobbs Act, including for its \nFifth Circuit petition.  Fasken Br. 37, 42.  That is not \ncorrect.  In the NRC adjudicatory proceedings, Fasken \nattempted to assert a contention regarding treatment \nof emergency response costs in the NEPA documenta-\ntion, and to reopen the evidentiary record based upon \nalleged NEPA deficiencies regarding transportation \nroutes.  The NRC denied party status, Fasken \n3 This case does not involve anything like the circum-\nstances in PDR Network, LLC v. Carlton & Harris Chiropractic, \nInc., 588 U.S. 1 (2019), the concurring opinion to which Fasken \n(but not Texas) invokes many times.  Fasken Br. 38, 42, 44.  \nThere, the question was whether a defendant in an enforcement \naction was somehow precluded from arguing that the agency\u2019s in-\nterpretation was wrong, because of the potential existence of prior \nHobbs Act review.  PDR Network, 588 U.S. at 27 (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  PDR Network was all about \u201cen-\nforcement actions,\u201d and had nothing to do with the \u201cparty ag-\ngrieved\u201d requirement of the Hobbs Act. \n\n7 \nappealed to the D.C. Circuit, and the D.C. Circuit af-\nfirmed.  Don\u2019t Waste Mich., 2023 WL 395030, at *3.  \nFasken did not seek review of that D.C. Circuit deci-\nsion by this Court.   \nYet Fasken now argues that its prior lack of suc-\ncess at the NRC opened up a second avenue to proceed \nwith its current claims before the Fifth Circuit as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Fasken Br. 37.  \nFasken argued the opposite below, contending that its \nclaims at the Fifth Circuit were \u201cdifferent\u201d and not the \nsubject of its attempted intervention at the NRC.4\nPutting \naside \nFasken\u2019s \nflip-flopping, \nhowever, \nFasken\u2019s argument fails because an appeal from a de-\nnial of intervention would allow the putative interve-\nnor to challenge only that denial and to seek reopening \nof the proceeding\u2014it does not provide carte blanche to \nchallenge, for any reason whatsoever, the underlying \nmerits determination of the adjudication, to which the \nintervenor was never a \u201cparty.\u201d  E.g., Alaska v. FERC,\n980 F.2d 761, 763 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cHaving failed to \nachieve the status of a party to the litigation, the pu-\ntative intervenor could not later seek review of the fi-\nnal judgment on the merits.\u201d); S. C. Loveland Co. v. \nUnited States, 534 F.2d 958, 963-964 (D.C. Cir. 1976) \n(requiring re-opening); Nat\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\u2019n\nv. FERC, 6 F.4th 1044, 1049 & n.4 (9th Cir. 2021) (ex-\nercising jurisdiction over petition brought by non-\nparty petitioner because petitioner is \u201cconsidered a \nparty for the limited purpose of reviewing the agency\u2019s \nbasis for denying party status\u201d (citation omitted)).  In \nshort, Fasken\u2019s actions at the NRC (which it appealed \n4 21-60743 Fasken C.A. Resp. in Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss \nor Transfer the Pet. for Rev. at 4. \n\n8 \nto the D.C. Circuit) cannot support its petition at the \nFifth Circuit. \nII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Exercise of Jurisdiction \nPursuant to Its \u201cUltra Vires\u201d Exception to \nthe Hobbs Act Was Error. \nTo repeat: neither respondent suffered from a \n\u201clack of access to courts,\u201d Texas Br. 17, nor did the \nagency do anything to \u201cshield its order from judicial \nreview.\u201d  Fasken Br. 16.  Texas could have attempted \nto intervene as a party and thereby secure meaningful \njudicial review, but it chose not to.  Fasken did receive \nfull judicial review by the D.C. Circuit of the claims \nthat it attempted to pursue in a proper manner, and it \ncertainly could have done so with the other claims that \nit tried to press at the Fifth Circuit.  There is no reason \nin the world that Texas and Fasken could not have \navailed themselves of the well-known, long-estab-\nlished route to meaningful judicial review provided by \nthe Hobbs Act.  But they didn\u2019t. \nThat fact renders all of the purported \u201cultra vires\u201d \nauthorities upon which respondents now rely (Fasken \nBr. 43-46, Texas Br. 21-23) inapplicable to this case.  \nIndeed, Texas admits as much, characterizing the \ncases it cites as being where \u201c[n]o statute provided a \ncause of action.\u201d  Texas Br. 22.  In those cases, courts \nwere addressing congressional or agency action that \nwas argued to completely preclude any meaningful ju-\ndicial review at all.  E.g., Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. \n184, 188 (1958); see also, e.g., Abbott Lab\u2019ys v. Gard-\nner, 387 U.S. 136, 139 (1967) (decision below held that \n\u201creview of these regulations was unauthorized\u201d); \nDeVillier v. Texas, 601 U.S. 285, 293 (2024) (reversing \nnon-statutory exercise of jurisdiction where the \n\n9 \nplaintiff had an available statutory \u201ccause of action\u201d \nfor compensation that it did not exercise); Knick v. \nTownship of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 201 (2019) (non-stat-\nutory equitable relief unavailable because of availabil-\nity of an alternative statutory \u201cadequate provision\u201d for \nobtaining relief, i.e., the Tucker Act); Edward Hines \nYellow Pine Trs. v. United States, 263 U.S. 143 (1923) \n(pre-Hobbs Act case against ICC); Skinner & Eddy \nCorp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (1919) (same); \nFed. Express Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th \n756, 763-764 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying Kyne et al.\nwhere the parties agreed that \u201cno alternative proce-\ndure for review of FedEx\u2019s claim exists,\u201d per 50 U.S.C. \n4821(a)). \nThat is\u2014emphatically\u2014not this case, as even \nJudge Jones essentially conceded in the opinion sup-\nporting denial of en banc review.  ISP App. 43a n.6 (cit-\ning Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., \nInc., 502 U.S. 32, 43-44 (1991)).  This case, instead, in-\nvolved the Fifth Circuit asserting judge-made author-\nity as an atextual supplement to what Congress care-\nfully prescribed in the Hobbs Act.  No case by this \nCourt, or outside of the Fifth Circuit, supports that.  \nThis Court\u2019s decision in MCorp makes that clear, by \ndeclining to apply Kyne and Abbott Laboratories be-\ncause of an adequate alternative opportunity for judi-\ncial review.  502 U.S. at 43-44.   \nTo make matters worse, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s parallel \nreview scheme for purportedly \u201cultra vires\u201d action is \narbitrary and unworkable.  In this very case, the Fifth \nCircuit deemed some of respondents\u2019 Administrative \nProcedure Act claims to be \u201cultra vires,\u201d but others \nwere not.  ISP App. 20a-21a; ISP Br. 22-23; NRC Br. \n\n10 \n22-23.  One of the most persuasive critiques of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s \u201cultra vires\u201d doctrine is that any clever \nlitigant can frame almost any argument of agency er-\nror as the agency exceeding its lawful authority\u2014it is, \nas Judge Easterbrook observed for the Seventh Cir-\ncuit, merely a \u201csynonym for \u2018wrong.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chi., Milwaukee, \nSt. Paul & Pac. R.R., 799 F.2d at 335.  Respondents \nhave no substantive response, but instead just com-\nplain that such a critique is \u201chyperbole.\u201d  Fasken Br. \n47; Texas Br. 23.  It\u2019s not\u2014it is spot on. \nFinally with regard to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra \nvires doctrine, respondents give short shrift to the du-\nbious origins of that doctrine even in the Fifth Circuit \nitself, as well as to the compelling weight of uniform \ncontrary authority.  See ISP Br. 20-22; NRC Br. 23-25. \nThose factors and authorities further confirm that the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s stated basis for hearing the petitions of \nTexas and Fasken was error. \nIII. The Atomic Energy Act Authorizes the NRC \nto License the Temporary Storage of Spent \nNuclear Fuel Away from a Reactor Site \nA. The Atomic Energy Act\u2019s provisions re-\ngarding the constituent radioactive ele-\nments of spent nuclear fuel authorize the \nNRC to regulate spent nuclear fuel. \nIn its decision, the Fifth Circuit accepted the oft-\nrecited (and accurate) proposition that \u201c[s]pecial nu-\nclear material, source material, and byproduct mate-\nrial are constituent materials of spent nuclear fuel,\u201d \nand then proceeded to base its statutory analysis upon \nAEA provisions addressing those constituent materi-\nals.  ISP App. 22a (citing Bullcreek v. NRC, 359 F.3d \n536, 538 (D.C. Cir. 2004)).  Respondents, however, \n\n11 \nhave decided to take a different tack: their AEA argu-\nments now are largely based on the fact that the term \n\u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d was not separately defined in the \noriginal AEA, but was instead added in 1988 as part of \nan unrelated overhaul of the Price Anderson Act.  \nFasken Br. 24 (\u201cIndeed, Congress did not amend the \nAEA to add \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 as a defined term until \n1988.\u201d (citing Price Anderson Amendments Act \u00a7 4(b), \n102 Stat. 1069)); Texas Br. 25-26.5\nRespondents\u2019 arguments run headlong into Pac. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & \nDev. Comm\u2019n, 461 U.S. 190 (1983).  That case was all \nabout \u201cspent fuel,\u201d id. at 194, and, more particularly, \nthe metes and bounds of how much Congress had oc-\ncupied the field regarding the storage of spent fuel in \nthe AEA, for preemption purposes.  The Court based \nits decision on its analysis of the then-current version \nof the AEA, including the provisions regarding the con-\nstituent elements of spent fuel.  Id. at 207.  The Court \nalso highlighted that \u201cthe NRC has promulgated de-\ntailed regulations governing storage and disposal \naway from the reactor.\u201d  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. at 217 \n5 Fasken makes much of the fact that a subsequent regu-\nlatory definition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d includes \u201cother radioac-\ntive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d Fasken Br. 26-27 \n(emphasis omitted) (citing Final Rule, Licensing Requirements \nfor the Storage of Spent Fuel in an Independent Fuel Spent Stor-\nage Installation, 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,700-01 (Nov. 12, 1980); \n10 C.F.R. 72.3).  That reference merely recognizes the existence \nof control rod elements and the like\u2014the packaging that holds a \nnuclear fuel assembly together\u2014which become irradiated with \nuse.  See, e.g., 10 C.F.R. 961.11, Appendix E, Section B.2.  More-\nover, materials \u201cmade radioactive by exposure to the radiation in-\ncident to the process of producing or utilizing special nuclear ma-\nterial\u201d are, in fact, \u201cbyproduct material.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2014(e)(1). \n\n12 \n(citing 10 C.F.R. Part 72).  The addition of a separate \ndefinition of \u201cspent nuclear fuel,\u201d on which respond-\nents now place such heavy reliance, had not yet oc-\ncurred\u2014that was still some five years into the future.  \nAnd the recently enacted Nuclear Waste Policy Act did \nnot affect the preemption analysis.  Pac. Gas, 461 U.S. \nat 219.   \nWhile the Court ultimately held that the chal-\nlenged state statute addressed economic matters re-\nserved to the states and was therefore not preempted, \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning offered definitive guidance on \nthe scope of the AEA.  The Court made clear that Con-\ngress had \u201coccupied the entire field of nuclear safety \nconcerns,\u201d and the NRC, given the already-existing \nstatutory and regulatory landscape under the AEA, \nhad exercised its authority \u201cto authorize the storage of \nspent fuel.\u201d  461 U.S. at 212, 218.  Indeed, a key prem-\nise of the Court\u2019s holding was that although the federal \ngovernment was responsible to develop and license \ntechnology for \u201cnuclear waste disposal,\u201d the state stat-\nute had not attempted \u201cto enter this field  * * *  occu-\npied by the federal government.\u201d  Id. at 219.  The main \narguments propounded by respondents regarding the \nAEA in this case, therefore, cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Pacific Gas.6\n6 Texas posits an analogy about erroneously concluding \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration can regulate water, be-\ncause it can regulate hydrogen-fueled planes with oxygen equip-\nment.  Texas Br. 38.  That misses the mark.  The more apt anal-\nogy would be one section of a statute criminalizing the possession \nof heroin, and another the possession of cocaine.  No one could \nseriously argue that merely mixing the two drugs together takes \none completely outside of the law.  Yet, that is the essential posi-\ntion of respondents here. \n\n13 \nB. Respondents are unable to proffer any \nplausible interpretation of statutory text \nto support what they say the law is. \nRespondents\u2019 definitional arguments reveal an-\nother fundamental flaw in their efforts to defend the \nresult of the Fifth Circuit: there is no sensible inter-\npretation of the statutes that leads to what respond-\nents contend the law to be.  Texas asserts that the \nNRC \u201ccannot license possession of spent nuclear fuel at \nall.\u201d  Texas Br. 40.  Similarly, Fasken asserts that \u201c[n]o \nAEA provision grants NRC express authority to issue \na license for storing spent fuel.\u201d  Fasken Br. 24.  But, \nat the same time, Texas admits that \u201cno one disputes \nthat storage facilities onsite are permissible; they \nmust be.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  Well, what statutory provi-\nsion provides that \u201cpermission\u201d?  Respondents do not \nsay. \nThe necessary flipside of respondents\u2019 arguments \nalso reveals their error.  If, as respondents contend, \nthe provisions of the AEA addressing the constituent \ncomponents do not authorize the NRC to issue a li-\ncense for the possession and storage of \u201cspent nuclear \nfuel,\u201d then the AEA also cannot prohibit the possession \nand storage of \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d\u2014you cannot have \none without the other.7  We would be in a state of na-\nture: the unavoidable implication of respondents\u2019 ar-\nguments is that ISP did not even need a license from \nthe NRC, and could have just constructed the facility \non its own.  It is hard to imagine a scenario more inim-\nical to what Congress expressly identified as the core \n7 The prohibitions upon possession without a license are \nat 42 U.S.C. 2077(a) (special nuclear material), 2092 (source ma-\nterial) and 2111(a) (byproduct material). \n\n14 \npurposes of the AEA.  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 2011(a), (b); \n2012(a); 2013(d).  The statute should be interpreted in \na manner that harmonizes those provisions, not cre-\nates such elemental conflicts.  E.g., Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts (\u201cReading Law\u201d) 181-182 (2012). \nC. Respondents\u2019 ejusdem generis-type inter-\npretations of the AEA are erroneous. \nNeither respondent tries to defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s interpretive analysis of the AEA.  The court be-\nlow held that the only permissible licenses with re-\nspect to special nuclear and source material were for \n\u201ccertain types of research and development,\u201d ISP App. \n22a, based upon 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(1) and (2) and \n2093(a)(1) and (2).  The Fifth Circuit inexplicably \nfailed to account for subsection (a)(3) of both statutory \nsections, and failed to give any meaning to subsection \n(a)(4).  And with regard to byproduct material, the \nFifth Circuit misconstrued an inapplicable provision \n(42 U.S.C. 2111(b)) based upon internet-derived con-\nclusions involving not byproduct, but special nuclear, \nmaterial.  ISP App. 23a; see ISP Br. 37. \nRespondents, however, do try to construct post-hoc\nejusdem generis-type defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s re-\nsult, at least with respect to special nuclear and source \nmaterial. Fasken Br. 29-31; Texas Br. 26-28, 40-43.  \nThose efforts fail.   \nFirst, respondents cannot identify a supportable \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d that fits their needs.  That, alone, \nprecludes the ejusdem generis-type arguments of re-\nspondents.  E.g., Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. \n214, 225 (2008); Reading Law 209 (\u201c\u2018the enumeration \nof the specific items is so heterogeneous as to disclose \n\n15 \nno common genus.\u2019 With this type of wording, the \ncanon does not apply.\u201d (quoting Lord Macmillan, Law \nand Other Things 166 (1938)).  The specifically enu-\nmerated potential uses here include research and de-\nvelopment related to atomic energy ((2073(a)(1), \n2093(a)(1)), research or development related to medi-\ncal therapy or medical therapy itself ((2073(a)(2), \n2093(a)(2)), and for \u201cuse in a license\u201d for certain isotope \nproduction facilities, and in nuclear power plants.  42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(3), 2093(a)(3).  Respondents have come \nup with an argued common attribute of \u201cproductive \nuse,\u201d which they say excludes temporary storage of the \nmaterials, even at reactor sites.  Fasken Br. 30; Texas \nBr. 28.  That, however, is a made-up restriction with-\nout any textual, historical, or other support, and is fur-\nther belied by the admission that \u201csome form of tem-\nporary, onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel inheres in \nthe use of nuclear fuel.\u201d  Texas Br. 36.  If there is any \n\u201ccommon attribute\u201d here (and ISP does not agree that \nthere is), the fact that the enumerated items include \nnuclear power plants would mean that regulation of \nradioactive materials that \u201cinhere\u201d to operation of \nsuch plants would fit comfortably within any reasona-\nble postulated commonality. \nSecond, whether or not one labels Sections \n2073(a)(4) and 2093(a)(4) as \u201ccatch-all\u201d provisions, \nthose terms indisputably have to be given some mean-\ning.  Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 596, 607-608 (2010); \nBabbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities for a \nGreat Or., 515 U.S. 687, 702 (1995).  Respondents\u2019 con-\nstructs fail to do so, and the better interpretation is to \nconclude that the provisions encompass the licensing \nof temporary storage of spent nuclear fuel at away-\nfrom-reactors sites.   \n\n16 \nIt is also important to give meaning to what Con-\ngress actually said about the duties of the NRC, which \nis that it was required to \u201cestablish by rule, regulation, \nor order, such standards and instructions to govern the \npossession and use of special nuclear material, source \nmaterial, and byproduct material, as the Commission \nmay deem necessary or desirable to promote the com-\nmon defense and security or to protect health or to \nminimize danger to life or property,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n2201(b), consistent with the \u201cdevelopment, use, and \ncontrol of atomic energy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2011(a),8 and \nwithout any locational limitation.  The restrictive con-\ntentions of respondents are irreconcilable with Con-\ngress\u2019s clear commands. \nIn short, respondents cannot defend the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s construction of the AEA, nor reconcile their ar-\nguments with Pacific Gas, 461 U.S. at 217, nor defend \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s departure from Bullcreek, 359 F.3d \nat 541, and Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. \nNielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1232 (10th Cir. 2004).  See \nalso, Beyond Nuclear, Inc. v. NRC, 113 F.4th 956, 964 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Which is perhaps why they have, \nnow, pivoted to relying primarily upon the NWPA for \ntheir merits-based arguments. \n8 These provisions are not, as Texas claims, mere empty \n\u201cpolicy statements\u201d that can be ignored for these purposes. Texas \nBr. 37-38, 41 (citing Sturgeon v. Frost, 587 U.S. 28 (2019)).  Ra-\nther, they are commands and delegations that do not conflict or \noverride any operative language from the statute and quite inten-\ntionally leave the agency with flexibility to regulate.  This Court \nhas recognized that such provisions should be applied as written.  \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 & n.6 (2024).   \n\n17 \nIV. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act Does Not For-\nbid the NRC from Licensing Private Parties\u2019 \nTemporary Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nAway from a Reactor Site. \nRespondents \nfundamentally \nmisconstrue \nthe \nNWPA.  They erroneously contend that it is the \nNWPA, rather than the AEA, that must provide the \n\u201cstatutory authority to license ISP\u2019s private, offsite \nstorage.\u201d  Fasken Br. 17; Texas Br. 29-31.  That is just \nnot so.  E.g., Balderas, 59 F.4th at 1115, 1121 (NWPA \n\u201cgoverns the establishment of a federal repository for \npermanent storage [i.e., disposal], not temporary stor-\nage by private parties.\u201d).  It is true enough that peti-\ntioners \u201cdo not contend the NWPA authorizes ISP\u2019s li-\ncense\u201d (Fasken Br. 20), but that is because no one ever \nthought that the NWPA was enacted to do so.  And it \nwasn\u2019t, as confirmed by the text, structure, and legis-\nlative history of that law. \nRegarding the text: the Fifth Circuit held that the \nNWPA \u201cdoesn\u2019t permit\u201d the ISP license, ISP App. 30a, \nbut cited no statutory provision that says that.  Nor do \nrespondents.  There is none.  Fasken contends that 42 \nU.S.C. 10155(h) \u201cspecifically forbids\u201d private offsite \nstorage facilities (Fasken Br. 19), but that provision \ndoes not \u201cforbid\u201d anything at all.9  Rather, the provi-\nsion says \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d\u2014meaning the \nNWPA\u2014\u201cshall be construed to * * * authorize\u201d private \n9 42 U.S.C. 10155(h): \u201cApplication * * * Notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, nothing in this chapter shall be con-\nstrued to encourage, authorize, or require the private or Federal \nuse, purchase, lease or other acquisition of any storage facility \nlocated away from the site of any civilian power nuclear reactor \nand not owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d \n\n18 \nstorage facilities.  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  In \nother words, the provision limits the scope of the \nNWPA.  But the NWPA is not, and never has been, the \nsource of the NRC\u2019s licensing authority at issue here.  \nRespondents\u2019 position cannot be squared with the stat-\nute\u2019s words\u2014it would make no sense for Congress to \nsay that the law did nothing to \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201cre-\nquire\u201d an activity if (as respondents argue) that activ-\nity was already altogether banned.  Respondents can \npoint to no statutory text whatsoever to support their \nmain substantive position. \nRegarding the structure: The overall purpose of the \nNWPA was to establish the federal government\u2019s re-\nsponsibilities for the permanent disposal of spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Subpart A set forth a plan for a permanent \nrepository.  42 U.S.C. 10131-10145.  Subpart B deals \nwith an interim storage program by the federal govern-\nment, pending permanent disposal.  42 U.S.C. 10151-\n10157.  That was a limited program, designed to help \nutilities manage spent nuclear fuel while waiting for a \npermanent disposal site, and\u2014significantly\u2014it ex-\npired by its terms in 1990.  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).  That \nis, there were a number of conditions and processes as-\nsociated with the program, including a requirement \nthat any utility desiring to participate execute a con-\ntract with the federal government \u201cno later than Jan-\nuary 1, 1990.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10156(a)(1).   \nRespondents chiefly rely upon provisions within \nthat Subpart B.  Texas Br. 29-31; Fasken Br. 18 (citing \n42 U.S.C. 10152, 10153, 10154).  Importantly, how-\never, all of those provisions concerned the limited fed-\neral interim storage program in Subpart B, and there-\nfore can be properly understood only as \u201cpreconditions \n\n19 \non private generators for obtaining federal interim \nstorage.\u201d  Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542.  It is plainly \nwrong for respondents to argue that those now-expired\nportions of Subpart B are, instead, the only potential \nsource of the NRC\u2019s current authority to license a pri-\nvate party\u2019s possession of spent nuclear fuel at all, an-\nywhere.  E.g., Idaho v. DOE, 945 F.2d 295, 299 (9th \nCir. 1991) (\u201cThe Act\u2019s restrictive language [in Subpart \nB] limits the requirements to the specific set of reme-\ndial storage agreements authorized by the Act itself.\u201d). \nRegarding the legislative history:  First, and im-\nportantly, the legislative history conclusively confirms \nthat Congress was fully aware that the AEA had been \ninterpreted and applied by the NRC to authorize off-\nsite storage of spent nuclear fuel by private parties.  \nE.g., S. Rep. No. 97-282, at 44 (1981); see Bullcreek, \n359 F.3d at 542; In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, \nCLI-02-29, 56 N.R.C. 390, 400 (Dec. 18, 2002) (\u201cMem-\nbers of Congress clearly were well aware that \u2018other \nprovisions of law\u2019 authorized private [away-from-reac-\ntor] storage facilities, as the existence, and fate, of \nsuch facilities was discussed in congressional commit-\ntee debates.\u201d), & n.35, n.44, n.45 (citations omitted).10\nCongress, of course, is presumed to know the state of \nthe law when it enacts legislation, e.g., Edelman v. \nLynchburg Coll., 535 U.S. 106, 117-118 (2002), and \nhere that knowledge is unquestionable.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontention that the meaning of the AEA should be in-\nformed by the subsequent NWPA (Texas Br. 28) is fair \n10 In the Matter of Private Fuel Storage, 56 N.R.C. at 399-\n410, cites and summarizes the voluminous relevant legislative \nhistory in a far more comprehensive manner than space will allow \nfor here. \n\n20 \nenough as a general proposition, but that proposition \ncuts squarely against respondents in this case.   \nSecond, with regard to the federal interim storage \nprogram invoked by respondents, the legislative his-\ntory reveals efforts to balance competing concerns \nabout the nature and scope of such a program. See \nS. Rep. No. 97-282 (1981); H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, pt. 1 \n(1982); 128 Cong. Rec. 28,032 (1982).  Sec-\ntion 10155(h), on which respondents heavily rely, went \nthrough drafts and debates which confirm that its ul-\ntimate role was to ensure that DOE would not take \nover private facilities to fulfill its NWPA responsibili-\nties, and that also make clear that utilities would not \nhave to exhaust potential off-site storage options to \ngain access to the federal interim storage program at \nSubpart B (which had been a requirement in some \nearly drafts).11  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 543.  Signif-\nicantly, however, \u201c[n]othing in those reports and de-\nbates suggests that Congress intended to prohibit pri-\nvate use of private away-from-reactor facilities.\u201d  Ibid.\nAlthough they avoided or disavowed it below,12 it \nis apparent that respondents\u2019 real argument is that \n11 See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-491, at 20 (1982), reprinted \nin part in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3792 (H.R. 3809, \u00a7 133(b)(1)(D)), re-\nported out of the House Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs on \nApril 27, 1982; Nuclear Waste Disposal Policy: Hearing Before the \nSubcomm. on Energy Conservation and Power of the House \nComm. on Energy and Commerce on H.R. 1993, H.R. 2881, H.R. \n3809, and H.R. 5016, 97th Cong. 2-3 (1982) (reference to \u201ctenta-\ntive agreement\u201d requiring generators to exhaust private offsite \nstorage as options in order to access federal interim storage). \n12 21-60743 State Pets. C.A. Br. at 24 (whether NWPA im-\npliedly repealed the NRC\u2019s AEA authority is the \u201cwrong ques-\ntion\u201d). \n\n21 \nthe NWPA silently repealed existing AEA authority, \nby implication.  Texas Br. 28, 43; Fasken Br. 21-23.  \nRespondents have not come close to clearing that high \nhurdle in this case.  E.g., Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 549 (1974).  The preexisting NRC authority under \nthe AEA to license private parties to store spent nu-\nclear fuel away from existing reactor sites was not \nmerely \u201cimplied,\u201d as Fasken argues.  Fasken Br. 22 \n(citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988)).  Rather, that AEA authority was demonstra-\nbly and indisputably known to Congress when it \npassed the NWPA, and formally enshrined in the Code \nof Federal Regulations after extensive notice-and com-\nment processes (which Texas contends \u201cprompted \nalarm,\u201d Texas Br. 3).  See Bullcreek, 359 F.3d at 542-\n543.  And, as explained above, there is no conflict \nwhatsoever, much less any \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d \n(Fasken Br. 22 (citation omitted)) between the AEA \nand NWPA with regard to the NRC\u2019s authority to li-\ncense private parties to temporarily possess spent nu-\nclear fuel.  Respondents\u2019 case for repeal by implication \nfalls woefully short. \nFinally, both respondents invoke West Virginia v. \nEPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022).  Fasken Br. 32-33; Texas Br. \n31, 35.  As petitioners have explained, however, the \n\u201cmajor questions\u201d doctrine has no applicability to this \ncase.  ISP Br. 38-39; NRC Br. 38-39.13  In regulating \nthe possession of nuclear materials from a safety per-\nspective, the NRC is clearly not acting \u201coutside its \n13 Nor is Texas\u2019s effort to invoke the \u201cno-elephants-in-\nmouseholes\u201d doctrine availing, Texas Br. 32, for reasons that in-\nclude the above-described fact that the NRC\u2019s preexisting imple-\nmentation of the AEA does nothing to \u201cbypass Congress\u2019s scheme\u201d \nas set forth in the NWPA.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal 'THINK' action, reflecting on the current state of my analysis and identifying the next critical piece of evidence to examine: the reply brief from the federal petitioners (NRC/USA). This observation did not contain new external information, facts, or arguments regarding the case itself. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) about how the Supreme Court will rule remain stable, consolidating the significant shift caused by the previous observation of the private petitioner's (ISP) reply brief.\n\nMy current belief state, which awaits the federal government's final arguments, is as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief is that the petitioners have successfully reframed this issue as their strongest path to victory, moving it from a \"contested battleground\" to a more straightforward question of procedural compliance and textual interpretation.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The central dispute remains the textual interpretation of \"party aggrieved\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344, contrasting it with the broader \"person aggrieved\" standard in the Administrative Procedure Act.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Consolidated):** The petitioners' argument, bolstered by ISP's reply brief, is that there is a long-standing, multi-circuit consensus on this narrow interpretation, powerfully supported by then-Judge Scalia's opinion in *Simmons v. ICC*. This precedent lends significant historical and jurisprudential weight to the petitioners' position.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Consolidated):** The narrative has decisively shifted from one of agency obstruction to one of litigant choice or error. The petitioners argue that Texas and Fasken had a clear, established path for judicial review, which they either chose not to use for strategic reasons (Texas) or used successfully for other claims (Fasken in the D.C. Circuit). This framing is likely to be compelling to a court that values procedural regularity and disfavors forum shopping.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Consolidated):** The Fifth Circuit's reliance on an *ultra vires* exception has been severely undermined. The petitioners have characterized this as a \"long-dormant outlier doctrine\" and, more importantly, argued it is inapplicable under the Supreme Court's precedent in *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.*, which holds that such extraordinary jurisdiction is unavailable when an adequate statutory review path exists.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief in the strength of the respondents' substantive case has been significantly tempered. The petitioners have mounted a formidable textualist defense of the NRC's authority.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The fundamental tension between the Atomic Energy Act's (AEA) broad licensing authority and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act's (NWPA) specific scheme for a permanent federal repository remains the core of the substantive debate. The political weight of the opposition to the license is also an unchanged contextual factor.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Consolidated):** The petitioners' key counter-argument is a direct textual challenge: the NWPA contains no language that explicitly or implicitly *prohibits* the NRC from licensing private interim storage. Their argument is that the NWPA governs the federal government's distinct obligations regarding a permanent repository, leaving the NRC's pre-existing, independent authority under the AEA to license private actors fully intact. This reframes the NWPA not as a repeal or preemption of the AEA, but as a parallel statutory scheme.\n    *   **Updated Belief (Consolidated):** The petitioners assert that their interpretation is consistent with Supreme Court precedent (*Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.*) and that the Fifth Circuit's decision creates a circuit split, positioning the lower court as an outlier.\n\n3.  **Overall Synthesis & Prediction Posture:** The momentum has reversed from favoring the respondents to favoring the petitioners. The petitioners have successfully framed the case as a choice between upholding clear statutory text and procedural rules versus endorsing a judicially created, outlier exception to benefit litigants who failed to follow the prescribed process.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** My prediction leans towards the **petitioners**. The procedural question now appears to be a clean, text-and-precedent-based off-ramp for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit without needing to resolve the more politically charged substantive question. A ruling based on the idea that Texas simply failed to follow the rules is a classic move for a court inclined towards judicial restraint and procedural formalism. I am now awaiting the federal government's reply brief to see if it reinforces, expands upon, or diverges from this powerful framing established by ISP.",

The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njudge-made ultra vires exception to that requirement \ncontravenes the Hobbs Act\u2019s text and background  \nadministrative-law principles.  Respondents argue that \nthey were in fact \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d and thus entitled \nto seek review under the Hobbs Act\u2019s terms.  28 U.S.C. \n2344.  But because none of the respondents intervened \n\n2 \n \nin the agency licensing adjudication, no respondent can \nproperly claim \u201cparty\u201d status here. \nRespondents\u2019 defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s merits \nholding fare no better.  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \n42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., generally bars possession of spent \nnuclear fuel, except as permitted by Nuclear Regula-\ntory Commission (Commission) licenses.  That Act au-\nthorizes the Commission to license private storage of \nspent fuel both at and away from the sites of nuclear \nreactors.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Policy \nAct), 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq., did not restrict or displace \nthat licensing authority, but instead confirmed the le-\ngality of the Commission\u2019s approach. \nRespondents\u2019 contrary merits arguments misappre-\nhend both statutes by underreading the Atomic Energy \nAct and overreading the Policy Act.  Further, respond-\nents\u2019 arguments risk dire practical consequences.  Taken \nto its logical conclusion, respondents\u2019 position threatens \nto deprive the Commission of authority to license the \nprivate storage of spent nuclear fuel in any location.  \nThat would grind the operations of nuclear reactors to \na halt.  Reactor operations automatically generate spent \nfuel; those operations cannot proceed if there is no-\nwhere to store that spent fuel.   \nA. Respondents Did Not Satisfy The Hobbs Act\u2019s Require-\nments For Seeking Judicial Review \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to decide whether re-\nspondents were \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \n2344, see Gov\u2019t Br. 26-27; contra Fasken Br. 13-14, 43, \ninstead allowing respondents\u2019 claims to proceed based \non a judge-made ultra vires exception to the party- \naggrieved limitation.  Respondents defend the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s atextual ultra vires exception and also argue \n\n3 \n \nthat they were parties to the Commission licensing ad-\njudication.  Both rationales lack merit.   \n1. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra vires exception is baseless \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra vires exception disregards \nthe Hobbs Act\u2019s plain text, is untethered to the norms \nthat govern litigation in court, and would require courts \nto draw highly malleable distinctions.  Gov\u2019t Br. 20-23.   \n \na. Respondents describe ultra vires review as a \n\u201cpreexisting mode[] of review\u201d that the Hobbs Act \u201cdo[es] \nnot bar.\u201d  Fasken Br. 44; see id. at 43-48; Texas Br. 21-\n24.  But, when examining statutory schemes that au-\nthorize \u201creview in a court of appeals following the \nagency\u2019s own review process,\u201d this Court has often held \nspecialized review mechanisms to be exclusive, \u201cdi-\nvest[ing] district courts of their ordinary jurisdiction \nover the covered cases.\u201d  Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 \nU.S. 175, 185 (2023).  The Court has applied that princi-\nple to the Hobbs Act, holding that litigants cannot evade \nthe Act\u2019s limits on court of appeals review by asking a \ndistrict court to enjoin purportedly ultra vires agency \naction.  FCC v. ITT World Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, \n468-469 (1984). \n \nTo be sure, \u201ca statutory review scheme of that kind \ndoes not necessarily extend to every claim concerning \nagency action.\u201d  Axon, 598 U.S. at 185; see Thunder Ba-\nsin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994).  Here, how-\never, the factors that Axon identified as relevant sup-\nport the exclusivity of Hobbs Act review.  Treating the \nHobbs Act scheme as exclusive would not foreclose ef-\nfective judicial review, Axon, 598 U.S. at 191; respond-\nents challenge a specific Commission decision (the \ngrant of a license to Interim Storage Partners (ISP)) \nrather than the constitutionality of the agency\u2019s struc-\nture or decision-making process, id. at 192-193; and the \n\n4 \n \nquestion presented here (whether the Commission has \nstatutory authority to license offsite storage of spent \nfuel) is squarely within the agency\u2019s expertise, id. at \n194.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 25.  Indeed, respondents\u2019 merits \nbriefs do not cite either Axon or Thunder Basin. \nIn any event, respondents did not invoke a district \ncourt\u2019s general federal-question jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. 1331, but instead filed petitions for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 24-26.  There is no basis for \nviewing that approach as a \u201cpreexisting mode[] of re-\nview,\u201d Fasken Br. 44, that operates independently of \nthe Hobbs Act.  Congress has given courts of appeals \nmore limited jurisdiction than district courts, and the \napplicable statute here limits court of appeals review to \n\u201cpart[ies] aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344. \nb. Respondents rely in part (Fasken Br. 45; Texas \nBr. 22) on this Court\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 \nU.S. 184 (1958).  But Kyne is a narrow decision that does \nnot apply where those with \u201cstatutory rights\u201d\u2014here, \nparties to Commission proceedings\u2014have a right to re-\nview under the Hobbs Act, including of claims that agency \naction exceeds statutory authority.  Board of Governors \nof the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. \n32, 43 (1991); see Gov\u2019t Br. 24-25.  And even where Kyne \napplies, that decision contemplates district-court review.  \nSee 358 U.S. at 186-187; Gov\u2019t Br. 24; Fasken Br. 45 (de-\nscribing Kyne as holding that \u201cfederal district courts have \njurisdiction\u201d under specified circumstances).   \nContrary to Fasken\u2019s suggestion, the government\u2019s \nposition does not imply that \u201cno court ha[s] the power \nto review\u201d the Commission\u2019s orders.  Br. 46 (emphasis \nomitted).  Any \u201cparty\u201d to a Commission licensing proceed-\ning who is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Commission\u2019s final deci-\nsion may seek review in a court of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \n\n5 \n \n2344.  Here, however, Texas never requested admission \nas a party.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 9, 27.  And while Fasken sought \nto intervene in the agency adjudication, the Commission \ndenied that request, and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s affirmance \nof that denial prevented Fasken from qualifying as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the Commission\u2019s ultimate licens-\ning decision.  See id. at 10, 27.  \n2.  Respondents are not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the \nHobbs Act \nRespondents primarily argue that they are in fact \n\u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Those argu-\nments lack merit and are inconsistent with the conclu-\nsions of every court of appeals that has actually ad-\ndressed that question.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 16-20, 26-30. \na. The Commission\u2019s adjudication of an application \nfor a nuclear materials license is similar to district-court \nlitigation between two parties.  The purpose of the \nagency proceeding is not to prescribe rules that will ap-\nply to regulated entities generally, but to determine \nwhether a particular entity should be allowed to engage \nin specified conduct that the Atomic Energy Act would \notherwise prohibit.   \nBecause intervention is the usual means by which a \nnon-party to an adjudication becomes a party, no re-\nspondent here was a \u201cparty\u201d under any traditional un-\nderstanding of that term.  Gov\u2019t Br. 16-20, 27.  Respond-\nents primarily argue (Fasken Br. 39-41; Texas Br. 9-12, \n15-16) that their participation in the licensing proceed-\nings was sufficient to make them \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d \nunder the Hobbs Act.  That argument suffers from nu-\nmerous flaws.  \nFirst, respondents argue that the dictionary defini-\ntions on which the government relies (Gov\u2019t Br. 17)\u2014\nwhich define \u201cparty\u201d according to its \u201cprecise meaning \n\n6 \n \nin legal parlance\u201d as \u201che or they by or against whom a \nsuit is brought,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1278 (4th ed. \n1951) (capitalization omitted)\u2014are inapplicable here \nbecause \u201ca licensing proceeding affects a wide range of \ninterested parties.\u201d  Fasken Br. 40; see Texas Br. 9-10.  \nBut judicial rulings likewise may affect the interests of \npersons other than the original parties to a suit.  The \nrules that govern intervention in court (see, e.g., Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24) recognize that fact, while providing mecha-\nnisms through which interested non-parties may seek \nparty status.  Intervention serves the same purpose and \nhas the same legal effect in Commission licensing adju-\ndications.   \nSecond, this Court\u2019s decisions underscore that \u201cparty\u201d \nas used with reference to adjudication is a term of art \nthat generally requires participation as a litigant in a \nproceeding.  Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  Contrary to Texas\u2019s con-\ntention (Br. 10, 17-18), this Court\u2019s passing use of the \nterm \u201caggrieved party,\u201d Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. \n137, 146 (1993), as a shorthand description of the per-\nsons who may seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 702 \ndoes not suggest that the Court views the terms \u201cper-\nson\u201d and \u201cparty\u201d as interchangeable.  Texas\u2019s reliance \n(Br. 18) on Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. \n871, 882-883 (1990), is also misplaced:  That decision ad-\ndressed what it means for a \u201cperson\u201d to be \u201cadversely \naffected or aggrieved by agency action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 702, \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 \net seq.  And while respondents invoke this Court\u2019s re-\ncent decision in Truck Insurance Exchange v. Kaiser \nGypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268 (2024), they ignore that deci-\nsion\u2019s reference to \u201cone or the other of the two sides in \nan action or affair\u201d as one definition of \u201cparty,\u201d id. at \n278 (brackets and citation omitted)\u2014a definition that \n\n7 \n \nhas particular salience in the adjudication context.   \nCompare Fasken Br. 39 and Texas Br. 17 with Gov\u2019t Br. \n18.   \nThird, Texas contends (Br. 10, 15-16, 18-19) that, be-\ncause some courts of appeals have held that submitting \na comment in an informal rulemaking suffices to confer \nparty status under the Hobbs Act, Texas\u2019s comments on \nthe draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) con-\ncerning ISP\u2019s license application likewise sufficed here.  \nBut the courts of appeals have recognized that, under \nthe Hobbs Act, \u201c[t]he degree of participation necessary \nto achieve party status varies\u201d depending on the nature \nof the agency proceeding.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, \n819 F.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see Gov\u2019t Br. 28.  \nBecause the Hobbs Act applies to a wide range of \nagency actions, it is unsurprising that what triggers \n\u201cparty\u201d status in one context may be inadequate in an-\nother. \nFinally, Texas asserts (Br. 15-16) that defining \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d to mean \u201cparticipant\u201d will avoid confusion \nregarding who is a party to a particular agency proceed-\ning.  But Texas identifies no instance of such confusion, \neven though numerous courts of appeals have adopted \nthe government\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Pet. 28-29.  Texas also claims that \u201c[r]eading the \nword \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018participant\u2019\u200a\u201d would \u201c\u200a\u2018ensure that \nthe agency had the opportunity to consider the is-\nsue[s]\u2019\u200a\u201d that will be subject to appellate review.  Br. 12 \n(citation omitted).  But respondents do not limit their \nparticipation-based conception of \u201cparty\u201d status to cir-\ncumstances where a participant apprises the agency of \nthe specific arguments it intends to assert in court.   \n\n8 \n \nIndeed, in this case, neither Fasken\u2019s intervention \nmotions nor Texas\u2019s comments questioned the Commis-\nsion\u2019s statutory authority to license temporary offsite \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel.  See In re Interim Storage \nPartners LLC, 93 N.R.C. 244, 247-251 (2021); In re In-\nterim Storage Partners LLC, 92 N.R.C. 463, 469-478 \n(2020); J.A. 115-122, 201-208, 215-220.  Texas neverthe-\nless argues that its comments on a draft EIS\u2014which \nwere entirely unrelated to the Commission\u2019s statutory \nauthority to license offsite storage\u2014permitted the State \nto contest that statutory authority in the Fifth Circuit.  \nThat argument is inconsistent both with Section 2344\u2019s \ntext and with the practical objective of \u201censur[ing] that \nthe agency had the opportunity to consider the issue \nthat petitioners are concerned with.\u201d  Texas Br. 12 (ci-\ntation omitted).    \nb. Respondents\u2019 arguments attacking the Commis-\nsion\u2019s intervention requirements fare no better.  Fasken \nasserts (Br. 38, 41-42) that the Commission\u2019s interven-\ntion rules unlawfully restrict access to judicial review.  \nBut respondents offer no basis for disputing that \nproperly tailored intervention rules would be an appro-\npriate means of determining party status in an adjudi-\ncation.   \nThe Commission\u2019s intervention rules themselves are \nsubject to judicial review, yet Fasken has never chal-\nlenged them.  Gov\u2019t Br. 30.  The D.C. Circuit considered \nand rejected Fasken\u2019s argument that it should have \nbeen admitted as a party, see id. at 10, 27, and Fasken \ncannot collaterally attack that holding in its current \nchallenge to ISP\u2019s license.  And because Fasken sought \nto intervene to raise arguments different from its cur-\n\n9 \n \nrent statutory challenge, the D.C. Circuit had no occa-\nsion to consider the application of the intervention rules \nto Fasken\u2019s challenge.   \nTexas does not challenge the Commission\u2019s interven-\ntion rules, but contends (Br. 14, 20) that compliance \nwith those rules is unnecessary to obtain party status.  \nBut the Hobbs Act requires persons that would appeal \nan adverse Commission licensing decision to first be-\ncome \u201cparties\u201d to the agency proceedings.  Under the \nplain meaning of the term, Texas did not become a party \nby submitting comments on the draft EIS, just as a non-\nparty to litigation would not become a party by filing \ncomments on a case docket.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 27-28.1 \nc. Respondents\u2019 reliance on other Hobbs Act and \nAtomic Energy Act provisions is likewise misplaced.  \nTexas argues (Br. 10-11, 13, 18) that a person can be-\ncome a party under the Hobbs Act without formally seek-\ning party status.  But the Atomic Energy Act clearly pre-\nscribes the mechanism for a person to become a party \nto a Commission licensing proceeding:  \u201c[U]pon the re-\nquest of any person whose interest may be affected by \nthe proceeding,\u201d \u201cthe Commission shall grant a hear-\ning\u201d \u201cand shall admit any such person as a party to such \nproceeding.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  And, contrary to \nTexas\u2019s suggestion (Br. 13), there is nothing anomalous \n \n1 Texas asserts (Br. 19) that, under the government\u2019s approach, \nan agency could limit a person\u2019s ability to seek judicial review by \nimposing onerous formatting requirements on documents.  That is \nnot so; such a requirement could be challenged as arbitrary and ca-\npricious or an abuse of discretion.  And because respondents have \nnot challenged the Commission\u2019s intervention rules, this case does \nnot implicate any question concerning the prerequisites an agency \nmay impose for obtaining party status.   \n\n10 \n \nabout the prospect that agency-specific statutes may es-\ntablish prerequisites for obtaining Hobbs Act \u201cparty\u201d \nstatus in particular agency proceedings.   \nRespondents suggest (Fasken Br. 39; Texas Br. 11) \nthat the Hobbs Act provision that addresses interven-\ntion in the courts of appeals, 28 U.S.C. 2348, supports \ntheir expansive reading of \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  But Sec-\ntion 2348 distinguishes between \u201cpart[ies] in interest in \nthe proceeding before the agency\u201d and other persons \n\u201cwhose interests are affected by the order of the agency.\u201d  \nIbid.; see Gov\u2019t Br. 19.  If an actual party to the ISP li-\ncensing adjudication had sought judicial review of the \nCommission\u2019s decision, respondents\u2019 \u201cinterests\u201d in the \noutcome might well have been sufficient to support in-\ntervention in the judicial proceedings under Section \n2348.  But because respondents were non-parties to the \nadjudication, Section 2344 did not authorize them to \npursue their own petitions for review.   \nd. Respondents\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit.   \nVarious arguments advanced by Texas (Br. 12-17) \nreflect the assumption that the Hobbs Act\u2019s party- \naggrieved requirement is jurisdictional.  The govern-\nment has historically argued that the party-aggrieved \nrequirement is jurisdictional but has not had occasion \nto reconsider that position after this Court\u2019s decision \nlast Term in Harrow v. Department of Defense, 601 U.S. \n480 (2024).  For purposes of this case, however, nothing \nof substance turns on whether the Act\u2019s party-aggrieved \nlimitation is a jurisdictional requirement or a manda-\ntory claims-processing rule.  Cf. Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638-639 (2016) (rejecting an \u201c\u200a\u2018extra-textual\u2019\u200a\u201d ex-\nception to a statutory exhaustion requirement and em-\nphasizing that when \u201cCongress sets the rules,\u201d courts \n\n11 \n \nhave a role in creating exceptions \u201conly if Congress \nwants them to\u201d) (citation omitted). \nFasken asserts (Br. 11, 37) that it is a party ag-\ngrieved under the Hobbs Act because the Commission\u2019s \nAtomic Safety and Licensing Board concluded that \nFasken had statutory \u201cstanding\u201d due to its \u201cproximity \nto the proposed facility.\u201d  In re Interim Storage Part-\nners LLC, 90 N.R.C. 31, 52 (2019), aff\u200a\u2019d, 92 N.R.C. 463 \n(2020).  But while the agency\u2019s determination as to stand-\ning suggests that Fasken was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the grant \nof ISP\u2019s license, it has no bearing on the distinct ques-\ntion whether Fasken was a \u201cparty\u201d to the Commission \nproceedings.  28 U.S.C. 2344; see Gov\u2019t Br. 27.   \nTexas briefly invokes (Br. 12) the presumption of ju-\ndicial review and argues (Br. 14-15) that the Commis-\nsion has impermissibly created an exhaustion require-\nment.  The presumption that agency action is judicially \nreviewable cannot override the Hobbs Act\u2019s plain text, \nwhich authorizes court of appeals review of specified \nagency actions, but only at the behest of \u201cparties\u201d to the \nagency proceedings.  And the Commission has not cre-\nated an exhaustion requirement; the party-aggrieved \nlimitation appears in the Hobbs Act\u2019s text.  See Gov\u2019t \nBr. 26. \nB. Congress Has Authorized The Commission To License \nTemporary Offsite Storage Of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nThe Atomic Energy Act authorized the Commission \nto license temporary offsite storage of spent nuclear \nfuel.  The Policy Act did not disturb that authority, but \ninstead manifested Congress\u2019s approval of the Commis-\nsion\u2019s prior materials-licensing practices.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontrary arguments reflect serious misunderstandings \nof the text and context of both statutes.   \n\n12 \n \n1.

The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njudge-made ultra vires exception to that requirement \ncontravenes the Hobbs Act\u2019s text and background  \nadministrative-law principles.  Respondents argue that \nthey were in fact \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d and thus entitled \nto seek review under the Hobbs Act\u2019s terms.  28 U.S.C. \n2344.  But because none of the respondents intervened \n\n2 \n \nin the agency licensing adjudication, no respondent can \nproperly claim \u201cparty\u201d status here. \nRespondents\u2019 defenses of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s merits \nholding fare no better.  The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, \n42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq., generally bars possession of spent \nnuclear fuel, except as permitted by Nuclear Regula-\ntory Commission (Commission) licenses.  That Act au-\nthorizes the Commission to license private storage of \nspent fuel both at and away from the sites of nuclear \nreactors.  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Policy \nAct), 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq., did not restrict or displace \nthat licensing authority, but instead confirmed the le-\ngality of the Commission\u2019s approach. \nRespondents\u2019 contrary merits arguments misappre-\nhend both statutes by underreading the Atomic Energy \nAct and overreading the Policy Act.  Further, respond-\nents\u2019 arguments risk dire practical consequences.  Taken \nto its logical conclusion, respondents\u2019 position threatens \nto deprive the Commission of authority to license the \nprivate storage of spent nuclear fuel in any location.  \nThat would grind the operations of nuclear reactors to \na halt.  Reactor operations automatically generate spent \nfuel; those operations cannot proceed if there is no-\nwhere to store that spent fuel.   \nA. Respondents Did Not Satisfy The Hobbs Act\u2019s Require-\nments For Seeking Judicial Review \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to decide whether re-\nspondents were \u201cpart[ies] aggrieved\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \n2344, see Gov\u2019t Br. 26-27; contra Fasken Br. 13-14, 43, \ninstead allowing respondents\u2019 claims to proceed based \non a judge-made ultra vires exception to the party- \naggrieved limitation.  Respondents defend the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s atextual ultra vires exception and also argue \n\n3 \n \nthat they were parties to the Commission licensing ad-\njudication.  Both rationales lack merit.   \n1. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra vires exception is baseless \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultra vires exception disregards \nthe Hobbs Act\u2019s plain text, is untethered to the norms \nthat govern litigation in court, and would require courts \nto draw highly malleable distinctions.  Gov\u2019t Br. 20-23.   \n \na. Respondents describe ultra vires review as a \n\u201cpreexisting mode[] of review\u201d that the Hobbs Act \u201cdo[es] \nnot bar.\u201d  Fasken Br. 44; see id. at 43-48; Texas Br. 21-\n24.  But, when examining statutory schemes that au-\nthorize \u201creview in a court of appeals following the \nagency\u2019s own review process,\u201d this Court has often held \nspecialized review mechanisms to be exclusive, \u201cdi-\nvest[ing] district courts of their ordinary jurisdiction \nover the covered cases.\u201d  Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC, 598 \nU.S. 175, 185 (2023).  The Court has applied that princi-\nple to the Hobbs Act, holding that litigants cannot evade \nthe Act\u2019s limits on court of appeals review by asking a \ndistrict court to enjoin purportedly ultra vires agency \naction.  FCC v. ITT World Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, \n468-469 (1984). \n \nTo be sure, \u201ca statutory review scheme of that kind \ndoes not necessarily extend to every claim concerning \nagency action.\u201d  Axon, 598 U.S. at 185; see Thunder Ba-\nsin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994).  Here, how-\never, the factors that Axon identified as relevant sup-\nport the exclusivity of Hobbs Act review.  Treating the \nHobbs Act scheme as exclusive would not foreclose ef-\nfective judicial review, Axon, 598 U.S. at 191; respond-\nents challenge a specific Commission decision (the \ngrant of a license to Interim Storage Partners (ISP)) \nrather than the constitutionality of the agency\u2019s struc-\nture or decision-making process, id. at 192-193; and the \n\n4 \n \nquestion presented here (whether the Commission has \nstatutory authority to license offsite storage of spent \nfuel) is squarely within the agency\u2019s expertise, id. at \n194.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 25.  Indeed, respondents\u2019 merits \nbriefs do not cite either Axon or Thunder Basin. \nIn any event, respondents did not invoke a district \ncourt\u2019s general federal-question jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. 1331, but instead filed petitions for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 24-26.  There is no basis for \nviewing that approach as a \u201cpreexisting mode[] of re-\nview,\u201d Fasken Br. 44, that operates independently of \nthe Hobbs Act.  Congress has given courts of appeals \nmore limited jurisdiction than district courts, and the \napplicable statute here limits court of appeals review to \n\u201cpart[ies] aggrieved.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344. \nb. Respondents rely in part (Fasken Br. 45; Texas \nBr. 22) on this Court\u2019s decision in Leedom v. Kyne, 358 \nU.S. 184 (1958).  But Kyne is a narrow decision that does \nnot apply where those with \u201cstatutory rights\u201d\u2014here, \nparties to Commission proceedings\u2014have a right to re-\nview under the Hobbs Act, including of claims that agency \naction exceeds statutory authority.  Board of Governors \nof the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. \n32, 43 (1991); see Gov\u2019t Br. 24-25.  And even where Kyne \napplies, that decision contemplates district-court review.  \nSee 358 U.S. at 186-187; Gov\u2019t Br. 24; Fasken Br. 45 (de-\nscribing Kyne as holding that \u201cfederal district courts have \njurisdiction\u201d under specified circumstances).   \nContrary to Fasken\u2019s suggestion, the government\u2019s \nposition does not imply that \u201cno court ha[s] the power \nto review\u201d the Commission\u2019s orders.  Br. 46 (emphasis \nomitted).  Any \u201cparty\u201d to a Commission licensing proceed-\ning who is \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Commission\u2019s final deci-\nsion may seek review in a court of appeals.  28 U.S.C. \n\n5 \n \n2344.  Here, however, Texas never requested admission \nas a party.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 9, 27.  And while Fasken sought \nto intervene in the agency adjudication, the Commission \ndenied that request, and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s affirmance \nof that denial prevented Fasken from qualifying as a \n\u201cparty aggrieved\u201d by the Commission\u2019s ultimate licens-\ning decision.  See id. at 10, 27.  \n2.  Respondents are not \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the \nHobbs Act \nRespondents primarily argue that they are in fact \n\u201cparties aggrieved\u201d under the Hobbs Act.  Those argu-\nments lack merit and are inconsistent with the conclu-\nsions of every court of appeals that has actually ad-\ndressed that question.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 16-20, 26-30. \na. The Commission\u2019s adjudication of an application \nfor a nuclear materials license is similar to district-court \nlitigation between two parties.  The purpose of the \nagency proceeding is not to prescribe rules that will ap-\nply to regulated entities generally, but to determine \nwhether a particular entity should be allowed to engage \nin specified conduct that the Atomic Energy Act would \notherwise prohibit.   \nBecause intervention is the usual means by which a \nnon-party to an adjudication becomes a party, no re-\nspondent here was a \u201cparty\u201d under any traditional un-\nderstanding of that term.  Gov\u2019t Br. 16-20, 27.  Respond-\nents primarily argue (Fasken Br. 39-41; Texas Br. 9-12, \n15-16) that their participation in the licensing proceed-\nings was sufficient to make them \u201cparties aggrieved\u201d \nunder the Hobbs Act.  That argument suffers from nu-\nmerous flaws.  \nFirst, respondents argue that the dictionary defini-\ntions on which the government relies (Gov\u2019t Br. 17)\u2014\nwhich define \u201cparty\u201d according to its \u201cprecise meaning \n\n6 \n \nin legal parlance\u201d as \u201che or they by or against whom a \nsuit is brought,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1278 (4th ed. \n1951) (capitalization omitted)\u2014are inapplicable here \nbecause \u201ca licensing proceeding affects a wide range of \ninterested parties.\u201d  Fasken Br. 40; see Texas Br. 9-10.  \nBut judicial rulings likewise may affect the interests of \npersons other than the original parties to a suit.  The \nrules that govern intervention in court (see, e.g., Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24) recognize that fact, while providing mecha-\nnisms through which interested non-parties may seek \nparty status.  Intervention serves the same purpose and \nhas the same legal effect in Commission licensing adju-\ndications.   \nSecond, this Court\u2019s decisions underscore that \u201cparty\u201d \nas used with reference to adjudication is a term of art \nthat generally requires participation as a litigant in a \nproceeding.  Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  Contrary to Texas\u2019s con-\ntention (Br. 10, 17-18), this Court\u2019s passing use of the \nterm \u201caggrieved party,\u201d Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. \n137, 146 (1993), as a shorthand description of the per-\nsons who may seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 702 \ndoes not suggest that the Court views the terms \u201cper-\nson\u201d and \u201cparty\u201d as interchangeable.  Texas\u2019s reliance \n(Br. 18) on Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. \n871, 882-883 (1990), is also misplaced:  That decision ad-\ndressed what it means for a \u201cperson\u201d to be \u201cadversely \naffected or aggrieved by agency action,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 702, \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 \net seq.  And while respondents invoke this Court\u2019s re-\ncent decision in Truck Insurance Exchange v. Kaiser \nGypsum Co., 602 U.S. 268 (2024), they ignore that deci-\nsion\u2019s reference to \u201cone or the other of the two sides in \nan action or affair\u201d as one definition of \u201cparty,\u201d id. at \n278 (brackets and citation omitted)\u2014a definition that \n\n7 \n \nhas particular salience in the adjudication context.   \nCompare Fasken Br. 39 and Texas Br. 17 with Gov\u2019t Br. \n18.   \nThird, Texas contends (Br. 10, 15-16, 18-19) that, be-\ncause some courts of appeals have held that submitting \na comment in an informal rulemaking suffices to confer \nparty status under the Hobbs Act, Texas\u2019s comments on \nthe draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) con-\ncerning ISP\u2019s license application likewise sufficed here.  \nBut the courts of appeals have recognized that, under \nthe Hobbs Act, \u201c[t]he degree of participation necessary \nto achieve party status varies\u201d depending on the nature \nof the agency proceeding.  Water Transp. Ass\u2019n v. ICC, \n819 F.2d 1189, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see Gov\u2019t Br. 28.  \nBecause the Hobbs Act applies to a wide range of \nagency actions, it is unsurprising that what triggers \n\u201cparty\u201d status in one context may be inadequate in an-\nother. \nFinally, Texas asserts (Br. 15-16) that defining \u201cparty \naggrieved\u201d to mean \u201cparticipant\u201d will avoid confusion \nregarding who is a party to a particular agency proceed-\ning.  But Texas identifies no instance of such confusion, \neven though numerous courts of appeals have adopted \nthe government\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Pet. 28-29.  Texas also claims that \u201c[r]eading the \nword \u2018party\u2019 to mean \u2018participant\u2019\u200a\u201d would \u201c\u200a\u2018ensure that \nthe agency had the opportunity to consider the is-\nsue[s]\u2019\u200a\u201d that will be subject to appellate review.  Br. 12 \n(citation omitted).  But respondents do not limit their \nparticipation-based conception of \u201cparty\u201d status to cir-\ncumstances where a participant apprises the agency of \nthe specific arguments it intends to assert in court.   \n\n8 \n \nIndeed, in this case, neither Fasken\u2019s intervention \nmotions nor Texas\u2019s comments questioned the Commis-\nsion\u2019s statutory authority to license temporary offsite \nstorage of spent nuclear fuel.  See In re Interim Storage \nPartners LLC, 93 N.R.C. 244, 247-251 (2021); In re In-\nterim Storage Partners LLC, 92 N.R.C. 463, 469-478 \n(2020); J.A. 115-122, 201-208, 215-220.  Texas neverthe-\nless argues that its comments on a draft EIS\u2014which \nwere entirely unrelated to the Commission\u2019s statutory \nauthority to license offsite storage\u2014permitted the State \nto contest that statutory authority in the Fifth Circuit.  \nThat argument is inconsistent both with Section 2344\u2019s \ntext and with the practical objective of \u201censur[ing] that \nthe agency had the opportunity to consider the issue \nthat petitioners are concerned with.\u201d  Texas Br. 12 (ci-\ntation omitted).    \nb. Respondents\u2019 arguments attacking the Commis-\nsion\u2019s intervention requirements fare no better.  Fasken \nasserts (Br. 38, 41-42) that the Commission\u2019s interven-\ntion rules unlawfully restrict access to judicial review.  \nBut respondents offer no basis for disputing that \nproperly tailored intervention rules would be an appro-\npriate means of determining party status in an adjudi-\ncation.   \nThe Commission\u2019s intervention rules themselves are \nsubject to judicial review, yet Fasken has never chal-\nlenged them.  Gov\u2019t Br. 30.  The D.C. Circuit considered \nand rejected Fasken\u2019s argument that it should have \nbeen admitted as a party, see id. at 10, 27, and Fasken \ncannot collaterally attack that holding in its current \nchallenge to ISP\u2019s license.  And because Fasken sought \nto intervene to raise arguments different from its cur-\n\n9 \n \nrent statutory challenge, the D.C. Circuit had no occa-\nsion to consider the application of the intervention rules \nto Fasken\u2019s challenge.   \nTexas does not challenge the Commission\u2019s interven-\ntion rules, but contends (Br. 14, 20) that compliance \nwith those rules is unnecessary to obtain party status.  \nBut the Hobbs Act requires persons that would appeal \nan adverse Commission licensing decision to first be-\ncome \u201cparties\u201d to the agency proceedings.  Under the \nplain meaning of the term, Texas did not become a party \nby submitting comments on the draft EIS, just as a non-\nparty to litigation would not become a party by filing \ncomments on a case docket.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 27-28.1 \nc. Respondents\u2019 reliance on other Hobbs Act and \nAtomic Energy Act provisions is likewise misplaced.  \nTexas argues (Br. 10-11, 13, 18) that a person can be-\ncome a party under the Hobbs Act without formally seek-\ning party status.  But the Atomic Energy Act clearly pre-\nscribes the mechanism for a person to become a party \nto a Commission licensing proceeding:  \u201c[U]pon the re-\nquest of any person whose interest may be affected by \nthe proceeding,\u201d \u201cthe Commission shall grant a hear-\ning\u201d \u201cand shall admit any such person as a party to such \nproceeding.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2239(a)(1)(A).  And, contrary to \nTexas\u2019s suggestion (Br. 13), there is nothing anomalous \n \n1 Texas asserts (Br. 19) that, under the government\u2019s approach, \nan agency could limit a person\u2019s ability to seek judicial review by \nimposing onerous formatting requirements on documents.  That is \nnot so; such a requirement could be challenged as arbitrary and ca-\npricious or an abuse of discretion.  And because respondents have \nnot challenged the Commission\u2019s intervention rules, this case does \nnot implicate any question concerning the prerequisites an agency \nmay impose for obtaining party status.   \n\n10 \n \nabout the prospect that agency-specific statutes may es-\ntablish prerequisites for obtaining Hobbs Act \u201cparty\u201d \nstatus in particular agency proceedings.   \nRespondents suggest (Fasken Br. 39; Texas Br. 11) \nthat the Hobbs Act provision that addresses interven-\ntion in the courts of appeals, 28 U.S.C. 2348, supports \ntheir expansive reading of \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d  But Sec-\ntion 2348 distinguishes between \u201cpart[ies] in interest in \nthe proceeding before the agency\u201d and other persons \n\u201cwhose interests are affected by the order of the agency.\u201d  \nIbid.; see Gov\u2019t Br. 19.  If an actual party to the ISP li-\ncensing adjudication had sought judicial review of the \nCommission\u2019s decision, respondents\u2019 \u201cinterests\u201d in the \noutcome might well have been sufficient to support in-\ntervention in the judicial proceedings under Section \n2348.  But because respondents were non-parties to the \nadjudication, Section 2344 did not authorize them to \npursue their own petitions for review.   \nd. Respondents\u2019 remaining arguments lack merit.   \nVarious arguments advanced by Texas (Br. 12-17) \nreflect the assumption that the Hobbs Act\u2019s party- \naggrieved requirement is jurisdictional.  The govern-\nment has historically argued that the party-aggrieved \nrequirement is jurisdictional but has not had occasion \nto reconsider that position after this Court\u2019s decision \nlast Term in Harrow v. Department of Defense, 601 U.S. \n480 (2024).  For purposes of this case, however, nothing \nof substance turns on whether the Act\u2019s party-aggrieved \nlimitation is a jurisdictional requirement or a manda-\ntory claims-processing rule.  Cf. Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638-639 (2016) (rejecting an \u201c\u200a\u2018extra-textual\u2019\u200a\u201d ex-\nception to a statutory exhaustion requirement and em-\nphasizing that when \u201cCongress sets the rules,\u201d courts \n\n11 \n \nhave a role in creating exceptions \u201conly if Congress \nwants them to\u201d) (citation omitted). \nFasken asserts (Br. 11, 37) that it is a party ag-\ngrieved under the Hobbs Act because the Commission\u2019s \nAtomic Safety and Licensing Board concluded that \nFasken had statutory \u201cstanding\u201d due to its \u201cproximity \nto the proposed facility.\u201d  In re Interim Storage Part-\nners LLC, 90 N.R.C. 31, 52 (2019), aff\u200a\u2019d, 92 N.R.C. 463 \n(2020).  But while the agency\u2019s determination as to stand-\ning suggests that Fasken was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the grant \nof ISP\u2019s license, it has no bearing on the distinct ques-\ntion whether Fasken was a \u201cparty\u201d to the Commission \nproceedings.  28 U.S.C. 2344; see Gov\u2019t Br. 27.   \nTexas briefly invokes (Br. 12) the presumption of ju-\ndicial review and argues (Br. 14-15) that the Commis-\nsion has impermissibly created an exhaustion require-\nment.  The presumption that agency action is judicially \nreviewable cannot override the Hobbs Act\u2019s plain text, \nwhich authorizes court of appeals review of specified \nagency actions, but only at the behest of \u201cparties\u201d to the \nagency proceedings.  And the Commission has not cre-\nated an exhaustion requirement; the party-aggrieved \nlimitation appears in the Hobbs Act\u2019s text.  See Gov\u2019t \nBr. 26. \nB. Congress Has Authorized The Commission To License \nTemporary Offsite Storage Of Spent Nuclear Fuel \nThe Atomic Energy Act authorized the Commission \nto license temporary offsite storage of spent nuclear \nfuel.  The Policy Act did not disturb that authority, but \ninstead manifested Congress\u2019s approval of the Commis-\nsion\u2019s prior materials-licensing practices.  Respondents\u2019 \ncontrary arguments reflect serious misunderstandings \nof the text and context of both statutes.   \n\n12 \n \n1.  The Atomic Energy Act authorizes the Commission \nto license temporary offsite storage of spent fuel \nThree Atomic Energy Act provisions authorize the \nCommission to issue licenses to possess the components \nof spent nuclear fuel for purposes, including interim \nstorage, that relate to generating nuclear power.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 31-42.  The Act does not impose any geo-\ngraphic restrictions on such storage.  In arguing that \nthe Commission lacks authority to license offsite stor-\nage of spent fuel, respondents misread the statutory \ntext and sidestep the disruptive practical implications \nof their arguments.   \na. Respondents primarily rely (Fasken Br. 24-29; \nTexas Br. 25-26, 38-40) on an argument the Fifth Circuit \ndid not accept:  that because the Atomic Energy Act re-\nfers to licenses to possess source material, special nu-\nclear material, and byproduct material, the Commission \nmay not license the possession of spent nuclear fuel.  \nBut as explained (Gov\u2019t Br. 3, 41-42) and as the Fifth \nCircuit recognized (Pet. App. 21a), spent nuclear fuel \nconsists of source, special nuclear, and byproduct mate-\nrial.  Indeed, the applicable definitions make clear that \nthose three materials are the relevant and regulated \n\u201cconstituent\u201d components of spent fuel.  See 10 C.F.R. \n72.3 (\u201cSpent fuel means fuel that has been withdrawn \nfrom a nuclear reactor following irradiation, has under-\ngone at least one year\u2019s decay since being used as a \nsource of energy in a power reactor, and has not been \nchemically separated into its constituent elements by \nreprocessing\u201d and \u201cincludes the special nuclear mate-\nrial, byproduct material, source material, and other ra-\ndioactive materials associated with fuel assemblies.\u201d) \n(emphasis omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. 2014(ee); 42 \nU.S.C. 10101(23) (\u201cThe term \u2018spent nuclear fuel\u2019 means \n\n13 \n \nfuel that has been withdrawn from a nuclear reactor fol-\nlowing irradiation, the constituent elements of which \nhave not been separated by reprocessing.\u201d).   \nRespondents argue (Fasken Br. 27; Texas Br. 39) \nthat, because spent nuclear fuel includes some materi-\nals in addition to source, special nuclear, and byproduct \nmaterial, a license to possess those three materials can-\nnot permit possession of spent fuel.  But the point of a \nCommission license is to authorize conduct that the \nAtomic Energy Act would otherwise prohibit.  See Gov\u2019t \nBr. 2, 31-32.  Because the Act does not generally ban \npossession of the additional spent-fuel components, their \npossession does not require a Commission license.  A li-\ncense to possess source, special nuclear, and byproduct \nmaterial is therefore sufficient to make the licensee\u2019s \npossession of spent fuel lawful.  And the Commission \ncan issue a single license authorizing the possession of \nall three regulated constituent materials.  See 42 U.S.C. \n2201(h).2  \nRespondents\u2019 argument\u2014which no court has adopted \n\u2014also has highly disruptive practical implications.  \nThat argument logically suggests that the Atomic En-\nergy Act does not authorize the Commission to license \n \n2 Fasken observes (Br. 27) that a later-enacted statutory provi-\nsion refers separately to \u201cspent nuclear fuel\u201d and to each of spent \nfuel\u2019s three regulated constituent parts.  See 42 U.S.C. 2210i(b).  But \nthat later-enacted provision requires that, when specified materials \nare \u201ctransferred or received in the United States by any party pur-\nsuant to an import or export license,\u201d those materials must be \u201cac-\ncompanied by a manifest describing the type and amount of materi-\nals being transferred or received.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2210i(a).  Because \nspent fuel is a substance different from any one of its constituent \nparts, it makes sense to refer to the different substances separately \nfor purposes of the requirement that \u201cthe type and amount of\u200a\u201d \ntransferred materials be accurately described.  Ibid. \n\n14 \n \nstorage of spent fuel at any location.  See Fasken Br. 24 \n(asserting that \u201c[n]o [Atomic Energy Act] provision \ngrants [the Commission] express authority to issue a li-\ncense for storing spent fuel\u201d).  As explained (Gov\u2019t Br. \n2-3), moreover, the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s licensing pro-\nvisions create exceptions to the Act\u2019s general ban on \npossession of source, special nuclear, and byproduct \nmaterial.  If (as respondents contend) the Commission\u2019s \nauthority to license possession of those constituent \nparts does not include authority to license possession of \nspent nuclear fuel itself, there is no evident reason to \nread the background prohibitions on unlicensed pos-\nsession of the constituent parts as banning possession \nof spent fuel.  Respondents disregard the practical im-\nplications of their theory.   \nb. Respondents argue that the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s \nmaterials-licensing provisions authorize licenses only \nfor an \u201cactive, productive use\u201d and that the interim stor-\nage ISP seeks to provide is not such a use.  Fasken Br. \n30; see id. at 29-32; Texas Br. 27-28.  Respondents char-\nacterize the permissible uses enumerated in the Act\u2019s \nlicensing provisions as active and productive.  But each \nof the relevant statutory provisions contains a catchall \nthat is not limited in that manner.  Those provisions au-\nthorize the Commission to grant licenses for the posses-\nsion or transfer of (1) special nuclear material \u201cfor such \nother uses as the Commission determines to be appro-\npriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 2073(a)(4); (2) source material \u201cfor any other use \napproved by the Commission as an aid to science or in-\ndustry,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(4); and (3) byproduct mate-\nrial for \u201cother useful applications as may be developed,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 2111(a). \n\n15 \n \nStorage of spent nuclear fuel is \u201cappropriate to carry \nout the purposes of\u200a\u201d the Act (which include licensing \nnuclear power plants), 42 U.S.C. 2073(a)(4), and is \u201can \naid\u201d to \u201cscience or industry,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 2093(a)(4), be-\ncause it is a practical necessity in order for nuclear \npower plants to operate.  And contrary to Fasken\u2019s sug-\ngestion (Br. 30), storage is a \u201cuseful application[]\u201d of \nspent fuel, 42 U.S.C. 2111(a), because storage is essen-\ntial to the production of nuclear power.  Limiting the \nCommission\u2019s licensing authority to \u201cactive, productive \nuse[s],\u201d Fasken Br. 30, would also call into question the \nCommission\u2019s longstanding authority to license the \nstorage of other nuclear materials\u2014such as mill tail-\nings, which are a type of byproduct material.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 2014(e)(2); 10 C.F.R. Pt. 40, App. A. \nHere again, respondents\u2019 arguments logically imply \nthat, although the Atomic Energy Act created a com-\nprehensive scheme for the regulation of nuclear mate-\nrial and authorized the licensing of nuclear power \nplants, the Act did not provide for storage of spent nu-\nclear fuel anywhere.  Texas asserts (Br. 46) that the \nAtomic Energy Act \u201cpermits onsite storage of spent \nfuel because some amount of storage is inherent in the \nlicense of use.\u201d  But Texas identifies no statutory basis \nfor licensing interim storage if, as it elsewhere argues \n(Br. 26-28), the provisions governing special nuclear, \nsource, and byproduct material do not confer such li-\ncensing authority. \nFasken, by contrast, acknowledges the broad impli-\ncation of its argument, asserting (Br. 29) that the gov-\nernment has failed to \u201cshow that storage (in any loca-\ntion) satisfies\u201d the requirements of the three Atomic \nEnergy Act licensing provisions discussed above.  \nFasken claims (Br. 34) that the purported absence of \n\n16 \n \nany Atomic Energy Act provision authorizing materials \nlicenses for interim storage of spent fuel is unproblem-\natic because the Policy Act now confers such authority.  \nAs we explain below, that argument reflects a misun-\nderstanding of the relationship between the two stat-\nutes.  The Policy Act confirmed Congress\u2019s understand-\ning that the Commission had preexisting authority to \nlicense private onsite storage, but it did not confer  \nany such authority.  Indeed, the approach to private  \ninterim storage that Congress took in the Policy Act\u2014 \nexpressing the intent that such storage would continue, \nwithout enacting any new authorization for the issuance \nof materials licenses to effectuate that intent\u2014makes \nsense only if Congress understood the Atomic Energy \nAct to confer the necessary licensing authority.  See pp. \n19-21, infra. \nc. The Commission\u2019s longstanding view, reflected in \npublished agency regulations that were promulgated in \n1980 and have remained in effect since that time, is that \nthe Atomic Energy Act authorizes the agency to license \nboth onsite and offsite storage of spent nuclear fuel.  \nGov\u2019t Br. 38-39.  Contrary to Fasken\u2019s suggestion (Br. \n4, 35), the Commission has historically grounded that \nauthority in the provisions of the Act discussed above.  \nSee 45 Fed. Reg. 74,693, 74,699 (Nov. 12, 1980); Gov\u2019t \nBr. 4.   \nRespondents suggest (Fasken Br. 35-36; Texas Br. \n46-47) that the Commission\u2019s longstanding view of its \nlicensing authority is due little weight because the Com-\nmission has infrequently licensed temporary offsite \nstorage.  But the Commission has exercised such au-\nthority both to license possession of spent nuclear fuel \nat facilities where no nuclear reactor has ever existed, \n\n17 \n \nand to renew licenses for storage at the sites of decom-\nmissioned reactors that no longer have facilities li-\ncenses.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 5-6.  The relative infrequency with \nwhich the Commission has licensed offsite storage does \nnot suggest that the agency has doubted the legality of \nthat practice, or that the Commission\u2019s assertion of such \nauthority has previously gone unnoticed.3 \n2.  The Policy Act did not disturb the Commission\u2019s  \nauthority under the Atomic Energy Act to license \ntemporary offsite storage of spent fuel \nCongress was aware in 1982 that the Commission \nhad interpreted the Atomic Energy Act to authorize li-\ncenses for offsite storage, and that the agency had \nadopted regulations to that effect.  The Policy Act did not \nwithdraw or displace that authority, nor did it amend or \notherwise restrict the application of the three Atomic \nEnergy Act provisions\u2014Sections 2073(a), 2093(a), and \n2111(a)\u2014that authorize the Commission to license \noffsite storage of spent fuel.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 4-5, 42-45.  \nRespondents\u2019 contrary arguments misunderstand the \nrelationship between the two statutes.   \na. Relying principally on 42 U.S.C. 10151-10155, \nFasken depicts (Br. 17-21) the Policy Act as a compre-\nhensive, standalone licensing regime.  Based on those \nprovisions\u2019 repeated references to (1) storage of spent \n \n3 To the extent respondents assert (Fasken Br. 8-11; Texas Br. 1, \n5) that it would be unsafe to store spent nuclear fuel at ISP\u2019s facility \nor to transport it to the facility, such claims are outside the scope of \nthe question presented and lack a sound factual basis.  When adju-\ndicating ISP\u2019s request for a materials license, the Commission con-\nsidered whether ISP\u2019s facility could safely store spent fuel and con-\ncluded that it could, and the agency thoroughly evaluated any \nthreats to health and safety that transportation of fuel to the facility \nwas likely to pose.  See J.A. 80, 87, 93, 276, 286, 290; Gov\u2019t Br. 10. \n\n18 \n \nnuclear fuel at the site of a nuclear reactor and (2) \noffsite storage in a federally owned facility, Fasken in-\nfers that those are the only permissible options for tem-\nporary storage of spent fuel.  That inference is unsound.     \nSection 10151 sets forth Congress\u2019s \u201c[f\u200a]indings and \npurposes\u201d in enacting the Policy Act.  42 U.S.C. 10151.  \nThat provision neither conferred new powers on the Com-\nmission nor restricted the authority the agency previ-\nously possessed.  Section 10152 directs various federal \nofficials to \u201cencourage and expedite the effective use of \navailable storage, and necessary additional storage, at \nthe site of each civilian nuclear power reactor,\u201d while \nidentifying various factors those officials should con-\nsider.  42 U.S.C. 10152.  That provision likewise neither \nexpanded nor contracted the Commission\u2019s preexisting \npowers.  Section 10153 directed the Commission to \u201ces-\ntablish procedures for the licensing of any technology \napproved by the Commission under section 10198(a) of \nthis title for use at the site of any civilian nuclear power \nreactor.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10153 (footnote omitted).  Section \n10153 did not grant any new materials-licensing author-\nity, but rather instructed the Commission to use its \npreexisting Atomic Energy Act authority to establish \nprocedures enabling power plant owners to more effi-\nciently obtain permission for spent-fuel storage.4  \nSection 10154 imposes certain procedural require-\nments for Commission hearings on specified types of \nonsite-storage license applications.  By making those \n \n4 In 1990, in accordance with that directive, the Commission au-\nthorized issuance of general licenses, see 42 U.S.C. 2077, 2092, 2111, \nto store spent fuel using Commission-approved storage systems.  \nSee 55 Fed. Reg. 29,181 (July 18, 1990) (adding 10 C.F.R. Pt. 72, \nSubpts. K and L). \n\n19 \n \nrequirements applicable to \u201cCommission hearing[s] un-\nder section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 \nU.S.C. 2239),\u201d Congress made clear its understanding \nthat the Atomic Energy Act would continue to govern \nthe issuance of storage licenses.  42 U.S.C. 10154(a).  And \nSection 10155 applies specifically to spent-fuel storage \ncapacity provided by the Department of Energy (DOE).  \n42 U.S.C. 10155(a)(1). \nRespondents cite (Fasken Br. 6; Texas Br. 30) Sec-\ntion 10155(h)\u2019s statement that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any \nother provision of law, nothing in\u201d the Policy Act \u201cshall \nbe construed to encourage, authorize, or require the \nprivate or Federal use, purchase, lease, or other acqui-\nsition of any storage facility located away from the site \nof any civilian nuclear power reactor and not owned by \nthe Federal Government on January 7, 1983.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n10155(h).  But that provision simply made clear that the \nPolicy Act did not independently encourage or require \nprivate offsite storage.  It did not purport to limit the \nCommission\u2019s preexisting licensing authority under the \nAtomic Energy Act. \nb. Far from establishing a comprehensive, stand-\nalone regulatory or permitting regime, the Policy Act \ndepends fundamentally on the continued application of \npreexisting law.  The Policy Act contains no provision \nthat either (1) prohibits the unlicensed possession of \nspent nuclear fuel or any of its components, or (2) au-\nthorizes the Commission to issue materials licenses for \nthose substances.  Those subjects continue to be gov-\nerned by the Atomic Energy Act, which does not limit \nthe permissible locations for storage of spent fuel.5  The \n \n5 Indeed, contrary to Fasken\u2019s assertion (Br. 23), the Atomic En-\nergy Act\u2019s licensing requirements apply even to the Commission\u2019s \n \n\n20 \n \nPolicy Act provisions on which respondents rely thus \nbuild upon, rather than displace, the Atomic Energy \nAct\u2019s regulatory and licensing scheme.  And while vari-\nous Policy Act provisions refer favorably to the devel-\nopment and use of onsite storage capacity, nothing in \nthat Act restricts the Commission\u2019s preexisting author-\nity to license offsite storage as well. \nFasken asserts that allowing the Commission to li-\ncense private offsite storage would contravene the Pol-\nicy Act by \u201cdiscourag[ing] creating new onsite storage \ncapacity.\u201d  Br. 20 (emphasis omitted).  That argument \nis both legally and factually unsound.  The Policy Act \ndoes not require that onsite storage must be pursued at \nall costs.  Rather, it states that owners and operators of \nnuclear power reactors should \u201cmaximiz[e], to the ex-\ntent practical, the effective use of existing storage facil-\nities at the site of each civilian nuclear power reactor\u201d \nand should \u201cadd[] new onsite storage capacity in a \ntimely manner where practical.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 10151(a)(1) \n(emphases added).  The Commission\u2019s licensing of pri-\nvate offsite storage where onsite storage is impractical \nis consistent with those provisions.  And as a factual \nmatter, although the Commission has asserted the au-\nthority to license private offsite storage since the early \n1970s, most spent fuel is stored at the sites of nuclear \n \nlicensing of a permanent repository.  The relevant Policy Act provi-\nsion (which Fasken quotes only in part, see ibid.) requires the Com-\nmission to \u201cconsider an application for a construction authorization \nfor all or part of a repository in accordance with the laws applicable \nto such applications\u201d\u2014i.e., the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s licensing  \nprovisions.  42 U.S.C. 10134(d) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. \n10141(b)(1)(A)(i) (providing that \u201clicenses to receive and possess \nspent nuclear fuel\u201d in the federal repository will be governed by \nrules promulgated \u201cunder the Atomic Energy Act\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nreactors, see Gov\u2019t Br. 6, and the Commission consid-\nered alternative storage options before issuing ISP\u2019s li-\ncense, J.A. 293-294. \nc. The Policy Act findings described above, 42 U.S.C. \n10151(a)(1), \nunambiguously \nexpressed \nCongress\u2019s \nawareness of existing private storage facilities and its \nexpectation that such storage would continue.  Yet Con-\ngress did not include in the Policy Act any new authori-\nzation for Commission materials licensing of private in-\nterim storage, as Congress presumably would have done \nif it had viewed the Atomic Energy Act\u2019s licensing pro-\nvisions as inadequate. \nGiven Congress\u2019s expressed intent that private in-\nterim storage of spent nuclear fuel would continue, the \nPolicy Act\u2019s failure to address materials licensing of \nsuch storage would have made no sense if Congress had \nunderstood the preexisting legal regime as authorizing \nlicenses only for \u201cactive, productive use\u201d of regulated \nmaterials, Fasken Br. 30, or as applying only to specific \nconstituents of spent fuel rather than to spent fuel it-\nself.  See pp. 12-16, supra.  By expressing its approval \nof then-existing storage practices, without enacting any \nnew statutory basis for those practices to continue, Con-\ngress effectively ratified the Commission\u2019s assertion of \nauthority under the Atomic Energy Act to license pri-\nvate interim storage of spent fuel.  And while the rele-\nvant Policy Act findings specifically reference onsite \nstorage, the Atomic Energy Act provisions that govern \nmaterials licenses impose no geographic limitations on \nthe storage of regulated materials. \nd. The Policy Act identifies a permanent federal re-\npository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel as Congress\u2019s \nlong-term objective, while recognizing the need for tem-\nporary storage capacity until a repository is created.  \n\n22 \n \nAlthough Texas blames (Br. 1-2, 4-5, 33) the Commis-\nsion and DOE for failing to build a permanent reposi-\ntory at Yucca Mountain, Congress has declined for \nmore than a decade to appropriate additional funds for \nthat site.  Gov\u2019t Br. 47-48. \nIn any event, issues regarding the status of a perma-\nnent repository for spent fuel disposal are not relevant \nto the question presented here, which concerns the lo-\ncations where spent fuel may be temporarily stored.  \nAnd, contrary to Texas\u2019s claim (Br. 6, 29), ISP\u2019s facility \ncannot become a de facto permanent repository.  The \nCommission has not licensed ISP\u2019s facility for perma-\nnent storage; the agency has recognized that it cannot \nindefinitely renew licenses to store spent fuel at such \ntemporary facilities, see Waste Confidence Directorate, \nOffice of Nuclear Material Safety & Safeguards, U.S. \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Generic Environ-\nmental Impact Statement for Continued Storage of \nSpent Nuclear Fuel\u2014Final Report, NUREG-2157, Vol. \n1, at 4-2 (Sept. 2014); and Texas\u2019s suggestion that the \nfacility will someday become a permanent repository is \nentirely speculative.6  \n \n6 Texas asserts (Br. 31) that the State was \u201csupposed to enjoy \nstatutory protections\u201d under the Policy Act, and that \u201cthe Commis-\nsion ignored those requirements.\u201d  But the requirements that Texas \ninvokes are triggered only when the government takes specified ac-\ntions under the Policy Act, such as providing federal storage or dis-\nposal facilities for spent nuclear fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. 10136, 10155(d), \n10156(e), 10166, 10169.  No statutory provision gives States veto \npower over the Commission\u2019s decisions regarding private tempo-\nrary storage of spent fuel, either at or away from a nuclear reactor \nsite. \n\n23 \n \n3. The major questions doctrine is inapplicable  \nRespondents\u2019 position would extend the major ques-\ntions doctrine far beyond all current bounds.  See Gov\u2019t \nBr. 48-49.  Respondents claim that the major questions \ndoctrine applies here because the Commission is exer-\ncising power it derived from three \u201cancillary\u201d provi-\nsions of the Atomic Energy Act.  Texas Br. 33; see \nFasken Br. 33.  But those materials-licensing provisions \nare central to the Act\u2019s system of (1) generally prohib-\niting the possession of spent nuclear fuel\u2019s primary con-\nstituent parts, while (2) authorizing possession to the \nextent permitted by Commission licenses. \nRespondents argue that the major questions doctrine \napplies here because the Commission \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d its \nauthority to license private offsite storage of spent fuel \n\u201cin a long-extant statute.\u201d  Fasken Br. 33 (citation omit-\nted); see Texas Br. 33.  But the Commission has as-\nserted authority to license private offsite storage since \nthe early 1970s, and it first exercised that authority in \n1982.  Gov\u2019t Br. 38-39.  Fasken notes (Br. 33) that the \nCommission did not promulgate its regulations ad-\ndressing offsite storage until 1980\u201426 years after Con-\ngress enacted the Atomic Energy Act.  Until shortly be-\nfore that date, however, it was generally assumed that \nspent fuel would be reprocessed and that onsite storage \nwould be sufficient.  Gov\u2019t Br. 3-4.  The Commission\u2019s \npromulgation of offsite-storage regulations in 1980 re-\nflected a reasonable response to changed factual cir-\ncumstances, not a change in the agency\u2019s view of the \ngoverning law.   \n \n \n \n\n24 \n \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was the result of a search for the federal petitioners' (NRC/USA) reply brief. However, the search returned the reply brief for the private petitioner, Interim Storage Partners (ISP), a document whose contents have already been analyzed and incorporated into my beliefs. Consequently, this observation provides no new substantive information, facts, or arguments regarding the case. My task-level beliefs (\u03b8) about the likely Supreme Court ruling remain unchanged, solidifying the state established after analyzing ISP's powerful reply brief. I am still awaiting the federal government's reply brief to complete my pre-argument analysis.\n\nMy current, stable belief state is as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief remains firm that the petitioners have successfully positioned the procedural question as their most likely path to victory. This issue has been transformed from a complex jurisdictional fight into a straightforward matter of procedural compliance and textualism.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The central dispute is the textual interpretation of \"party aggrieved\" in the Hobbs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344). The petitioners' argument, now consolidated, is that this term requires formal participation in the agency proceeding, a narrower standard than the Administrative Procedure Act's \"person aggrieved.\"\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' position is buttressed by what they present as a decades-long, multi-circuit consensus, most powerfully articulated by then-Judge Scalia in *Simmons v. ICC*. This precedent lends significant historical and jurisprudential weight to their argument, making the Fifth Circuit's position appear as a significant outlier.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The narrative has been decisively reframed. The issue is no longer about an agency potentially shielding itself from review, but about litigants (Texas and Fasken) who had a clear, established path to judicial review and either chose not to use it (Texas) or used it for other claims in a different court (Fasken). This framing, which suggests strategic error or forum shopping, is likely to resonate with a Court that prioritizes procedural regularity.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The Fifth Circuit's reliance on an *ultra vires* exception has been severely weakened. The petitioners have successfully argued that this is an outlier doctrine that is inapplicable under the Supreme Court's precedent in *Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.*, which holds that such extraordinary jurisdiction is unavailable when an adequate statutory review path exists.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief that the petitioners have a formidable textualist defense of the NRC's authority is unchanged. The respondents' case on the merits appears significantly weaker in light of the petitioners' counter-arguments.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The core substantive tension remains between the Atomic Energy Act's (AEA) broad grant of licensing authority and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act's (NWPA) specific, but arguably separate, scheme for a permanent federal repository.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' most potent argument is a direct textual one: the NWPA contains no language that explicitly or implicitly *prohibits* or *repeals* the NRC's pre-existing, independent authority under the AEA to license private actors for interim storage. They argue the NWPA governs the federal government's distinct obligations, leaving the NRC's authority over private licensing untouched. This reframes the NWPA not as a limitation on the AEA, but as a parallel statutory scheme.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners have effectively positioned the Fifth Circuit's decision as an outlier that creates a circuit split and runs contrary to the spirit of Supreme Court precedent like *Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.*\n\n3.  **Overall Synthesis & Prediction Posture:** The momentum remains decisively with the petitioners. The case has been framed as a choice between upholding clear statutory text and procedural rules versus endorsing a judicially created exception to aid litigants who failed to follow the prescribed process.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** My prediction continues to lean strongly towards the **petitioners**. The procedural question provides a clean, text-and-precedent-based \"off-ramp\" for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit without needing to resolve the more politically contentious substantive question. A ruling based on the idea that Texas and Fasken simply failed to follow the rules is a classic move for a court inclined towards judicial restraint and procedural formalism. My analysis is now contingent on seeing the federal government's reply brief to confirm if it aligns with, expands upon, or diverges from the powerful framing established by ISP.",

The arguments presented by the United States are in near-perfect alignment with those of the private petitioner (Interim Storage Partners), creating a unified and formidable front. My prior belief that the petitioners have framed this case for a favorable ruling is now bolstered by new, specific factual details and legal arguments.\n\nMy updated task-level beliefs (\u03b8) are as follows:\n\n1.  **On the Procedural Question (Hobbs Act Standing):** My belief that the procedural question is the petitioners' strongest path to victory is now solidified. The federal government's brief adds critical details that make the respondents' position appear not just procedurally flawed, but factually and equitably weak.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The core of the dispute remains the textualist interpretation of \"party aggrieved\" in the Hobbs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344), which petitioners argue requires formal intervention in an adjudicatory proceeding, a standard distinct from the APA's \"person aggrieved.\"\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The petitioners' reliance on a long-standing, multi-circuit consensus, epitomized by then-Judge Scalia's opinion in *Simmons v. ICC*, remains a cornerstone of their argument, framing the Fifth Circuit's ruling as a stark outlier.\n    *   **Reinforced Belief:** The narrative of procedural forfeiture is now even more compelling. The federal brief confirms that the respondents had a clear statutory path to become parties under the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2239(a)(1)(A)) by requesting a hearing, but failed to use it. The government also sharpens the textual argument by pointing to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2348, which distinguishes between \"parties in interest\" who can petition for review and other \"persons whose interests are affected\" who may only intervene in an existing court case.\n    *   **New, Critical Information:** The most impactful new information is the revelation that **neither Texas nor Fasken raised the issue of the NRC's statutory authority during the agency proceedings.** Their comments and motions focused on other matters (e.g., environmental impact). This fact devastates the respondents' claim that they put the agency on notice. It transforms their failure from a simple procedural misstep into a complete failure to exhaust or preserve the very legal argument they later brought to the Fifth Circuit. This makes a reversal on procedural grounds exceptionally clean for the Supreme Court.\n    *   **Reinforced Belief:** The attack on the Fifth Circuit's *ultra vires* exception is strengthened by direct citations to *Axon Enter., Inc. v. FTC* and a reaffirmation that *MCorp Fin., Inc.* forecloses such exceptions when a statutory review scheme exists.\n\n2.  **On the Substantive Question (AEA and NWPA Authority):** My belief in the strength of the petitioners' textualist defense of the NRC's authority is also reinforced, and a significant new practical argument has been introduced.\n    *   **Stable Belief:** The central substantive argument remains that the Atomic Energy Act's (AEA) broad grant of licensing authority was never explicitly or implicitly repealed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA). The petitioners maintain that the NWPA created a parallel, but separate, scheme governing the *federal government's* obligations for a permanent repository, leaving the NRC's authority over *private* interim storage intact.\n    *   **New, Critical Information:** The federal government introduces a powerful \"parade of horribles\" argument: accepting the respondents' position would logically call into question the NRC's authority to license *any* private storage of spent fuel, including at reactor sites. This, they argue, **\"would grind the operations of nuclear reactors to a halt,\"** as there would be nowhere to legally store the spent fuel they generate. This practical, national-interest argument provides a compelling, non-textual reason for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit.\n    *   **Belief Clarified:** The federal brief explicitly includes a section arguing that the **Major Questions Doctrine is inapplicable**. This confirms that the petitioners are proactively neutralizing a potential line of attack from the Court's conservative wing, rather than waiting to address it defensively.\n\n3.  **Overall Synthesis & Prediction Posture:** The arrival of the federal government's reply brief completes the picture and shows the petitioners' arguments to be fully aligned, comprehensive, and strategically sound. The momentum is now overwhelmingly in their favor.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** My prediction leans even more strongly towards a **reversal of the Fifth Circuit**. The procedural \"off-ramp\" is now wider and better paved than ever, thanks to the new evidence that respondents failed to raise the substantive issue at the agency level. A ruling on this basis would align with the Court's preference for procedural regularity and judicial restraint, allowing it to correct the lower court without delving into the politically charged merits of nuclear waste policy. The powerful new practical argument about shutting down the nuclear industry provides a strong backstop, making a ruling for the respondents on the merits seem highly improbable due to its disruptive consequences.",
