    "facts_of_the_case": "The Surface Transportation Board (STB) granted a petition from the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition to construct and operate an 80-mile railway in Utah\u2019s Uinta Basin. The railway\u2019s primary purpose would be to transport waxy crude oil from the basin to the national rail network. The STB conducted an environmental review process, including the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Board issued a final decision in December 2021, authorizing the construction and operation of the railway subject to environmental mitigation conditions.\n\nIn its environmental analysis, the STB considered various impacts of the railway\u2019s construction and operation within the project area, including effects on water resources, air quality, special status species, land use, and local economies. However, the Board declined to analyze certain \u201cdownline impacts\u201d\u2014effects from increased train traffic on existing rail lines beyond the new railway. The STB also omitted analysis of other potential environmental effects, such as increased crude oil refining impacts on Gulf Coast communities, upline impacts of increased drilling in the Uinta Basin, and downline effects of potential oil spills along the Colorado River. Finally, the Board did not disclose the potential effects of the project on historic sites or structures along the Union Pacific line in Eagle County. The Board justified these omissions by arguing that minimal increases in train traffic on existing lines were unlikely to cause significant impacts, and that some effects were beyond the scope of its regulatory authority.\n\nEagle County asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the Board\u2019s orders, and the granted the petitions in part, denied them in part, and vacated the underlying order.",

It correctly identifies the core legal issue (scope of NEPA review), the key concept ('proximate cause'), and the most crucial initial document (Petition for a Writ of Certiorari). This planning dramatically reduces uncertainty about how to proceed, making subsequent information-gathering actions far more efficient and targeted. It's a crucial step in moving from zero knowledge to a structured investigation.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): The strategy outlined is a highly generalizable and effective blueprint for SCOTUS case prediction. The sequence of (1) understanding the petitioner's framing via the cert petition, (2) understanding the respondent's position, (3) researching precedent, and (4) considering judicial philosophy is a canonical approach to legal analysis. Codifying this as an initial step provides immense value for future, similar tasks, making it a strong example of effective design.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action is highly valuable because it establishes a robust and efficient plan for the current task while simultaneously demonstrating a reusable, expert-level strategy for the general problem of SCOTUS prediction.",

I know the general legal question but lack the specific arguments, legal precedents, and statutory interpretations that the petitioners (the party that brought the case to the Court) are using. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the foundational document that lays out this entire framework. It is the document that convinced the Court to take the case in the first place. Analyzing it will cause a massive update to my beliefs, moving from a general understanding of the conflict to a specific, granular knowledge of the petitioner's legal theory. This directly addresses the primary identified information gap and is the single most valuable piece of information to acquire at this stage for predicting the outcome.\n\n**Design EIG (0.8):** This action has high value for refining my general prediction strategy. It strongly confirms the hypothesis that the first step in analyzing any SCOTUS case should be to read the cert petition. This document frames the questions, presents the core arguments that will be debated throughout the merits stage, and reveals the strategic choices made by the petitioners. Successfully using this action to build a foundational understanding validates a critical step in an optimal information-gathering sequence. It teaches the model that to predict the end of the story (the judgment), you must first understand the beginning (why the Court took the case).\n\n**Joint EIG (1.75):** The action is nearly perfect for the current state. It provides a huge amount of task-specific information while also strongly validating a core principle of the overall prediction methodology. The resulting score is very high, reflecting the action's critical importance.",

My beliefs have been updated to include the following key parameters of the case:\n\n*   **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is the required scope of an agency's environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Supreme Court will decide whether an agency must study environmental impacts beyond the direct, or \"proximate,\" effects of the specific action over which it has regulatory authority.\n*   **Key Legal Concept:** The case hinges on the application of the common-law concept of \"proximate cause\" to the statutory requirements of NEPA. The dispute is over how far down the causal chain of effects an agency is required to look.\n*   **Factual & Procedural Context:** The Surface Transportation Board (STB) approved an 80-mile railway in Utah. In its NEPA review, the STB analyzed local impacts but declined to analyze \"downline\" effects (e.g., increased rail traffic elsewhere, potential oil spills, impacts of oil refining) and \"upline\" effects (e.g., increased oil drilling). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled against the STB, finding its review was improperly narrow, and vacated the approval. The petitioners are asking the Supreme Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit's decision.\n*   **Identified Information Gap:** My understanding is still preliminary. I have identified the core conflict but do not yet know the specific legal precedents, statutory arguments, or policy considerations that the petitioners will use to argue for a narrower interpretation of NEPA. The next logical step is to analyze the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to understand the foundation of the petitioner's case, which will be a primary signal for predicting the Court's ultimate ruling.",

It will reveal their precise framing of the legal question, the precedents they rely on, and their core statutory and constitutional arguments. This information is essential for mapping the case onto the known jurisprudences of the individual Justices and moving from a general understanding to a specific, evidence-based prediction. Without it, my belief state cannot be meaningfully updated.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because this action tests a core, repeatable strategy: using specific metadata filters (`proceeding_title`) to efficiently locate foundational case documents. Its success validates this as a primary heuristic for starting any case analysis. Its failure would provide equally valuable information about the limitations of my search tools or database, forcing me to develop alternative strategies for acquiring primary source material.

A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 74a-189a, 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Board\u2019s response to the comments did not dis-\ncuss particular refineries in other locations, such as the \nTexas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts and Puget Sound, to \nwhich oil from the Basin might ultimately be shipped.  \nBut the environmental impact statement acknowledged \nthe possibility of increased refining in those areas.  J.A. \n477-482.  The Board determined in the statement that \nmuch of the oil would likely be transported to \u201cmarkets \nin other regions of the United States,\u201d J.A. 477, and to \nthe Gulf Coast and Puget Sound areas in particular, J.A. \n478, but the Board observed that \u201c[t]he final destina-\ntions of the trains would depend on the ability and will-\ningness of refineries in other markets to receive rail \ncars carrying Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil \nin their refineries.\u201d J.A. 477.  Still, the Board prepared \nestimates of how much potential oil development in the \nUinta Basin might increase transportation of oil to the \nGulf Coast and Puget Sound.  J.A. 481-482.   \nd. Ultimately, the Board\u2019s final decision authorized \nconstruction and operation of the proposed railroad \nline.  Pet. App. 74a-123a.  The Board\u2019s final decision re-\nviewed the environmental effects described in the final \nenvironmental impact statement at length.  See id. at \n83a-117a.   \nIn addressing the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development, the Board reaf-\nfirmed its prior analysis.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The \nBoard explained that it had \u201cestimated aggregate emis-\nsions from potential future oil and gas development \n\n12 \n \nbased on the best available information regarding emis-\nsions from oil and gas production in the Basin.\u201d  Id. at \n106a.  It further acknowledged that, \u201c[t]o the extent \nthat\u201d crude oil transported on the line \u201cwould be com-\nbusted to produce energy, emissions from the combus-\ntion of the fuels would produce\u201d greenhouse gasses, \nwhich could represent \u201cup to approximately 0.8% of na-\ntionwide\u201d emissions and 0.1% of global emissions.  Ibid.  \nBut the Board found that \u201cthe actual volumes of crude \noil that would move over the Line would depend on var-\nious independent variables and influences, including \ngeneral domestic and global economic conditions, com-\nmodity pricing, the strategic and capital investment de-\ncisions of oil producers, and future market demand for \ncrude oil from the Basin,  * * *  among other factors.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nThe Board rejected the contention that it had given \ninsufficient consideration to the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil production and refining.  Pet. App. \n107a.  The Board reiterated that it \u201chas no authority or \njurisdiction over development of oil and gas in the Basin \nnor any authority to control or mitigate the impacts of \nany such development.\u201d  Id. at 108a.  And it repeated \nthat \u201c[o]il and gas development that may occur follow-\ning authorization of [the new railroad line] would entail \nmany separate and independent projects that have not \nyet been proposed or planned and that could occur on \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land and could range in \nscale from a single vertical oil well to a large lease.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIn the end, the Board recognized that the new rail-\nroad line was \u201clikely to produce unavoidable environ-\nmental impacts,\u201d but it found that it could impose \u201cex-\ntensive mitigation conditions\u201d to \u201cminimize those im-\n\n13 \n \npacts to the extent practicable.\u201d  Pet. App. 118a-119a.  \nIt also determined that \u201cconstruction and operation of\u201d \nthe new line would \u201chave substantial transportation and \neconomic benefits\u201d that outweighed the environmental \nconcerns.  Id. at 119a.   \n4. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations (collectively, the \u201cnon-federal re-\nspondents\u201d) filed petitions for review of the Board\u2019s de-\ncision that were consolidated into a single proceeding \nbefore the court of appeals.  See Pet. App. 9a, 13a.  The \ncourt granted the petitions in part and denied them in \npart.  Id. at 1a-71a.   \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals held that the \nBoard\u2019s environmental impact statement improperly \nexcluded further analysis of the upstream environmen-\ntal effects of increased oil production in the Basin and \nthe localized downstream effects of ultimately pro-\ncessing some of that oil in refineries in Texas and Loui-\nsiana.  Pet. App. 28a-37a.  The court first rejected the \nargument that the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis was invalid \nbecause the Board classified the upstream and down-\nstream consequences of oil and gas development as \u201ccu-\nmulative\u201d rather than \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  Id. at 28a-29a.  \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[e]ven if the Board errone-\nously characterized the impacts,\u201d the challengers had \n\u201cidentif[ied] no way in which this decision materially af-\nfected the Board\u2019s analysis under NEPA.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard had both \u201cacknowledged the impact of increased \noil extraction in the Basin and explained [that] \u2018[t]he im-\npacts and the analysis of those impacts would be the \nsame no matter which label [it] used.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a (quot-\ning id. at 108a & n.15 (Final Exemption Decision)) (first \nset of brackets in original).  The court therefore con-\ncluded that the purported misclassification of the ef-\n\n14 \n \nfects could not \u201cbe said \u2018to undermine informed public \ncomment and informed decisionmaking.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a-\n30a (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals agreed, however, with the non-\nfederal respondents\u2019 argument that the Board had \nfailed to justify the absence of further analysis of the \nalleged upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development in the environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court concluded that the \nBoard\u2019s limited discussion of those harms could not be \njustified either on the ground that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences were not \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable,\u201d or on the ground that the Board lacked the \nstatutory authority to prevent those consequences.  Id. \nat 30a-31a (citation omitted).    \nAs to reasonable foreseeability, the court of appeals \nheld that the agency could not rely on its \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nin the Basin and the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the \n[oil]\u2019\u200a\u201d after it was transported over the proposed line \nand entered onto existing lines.  Pet. App. 32a (citation \nomitted; brackets in original).  The court stated that, \nwhile \u201cgreat \u2018deference [is] owed to [the Board\u2019s] tech-\nnical judgments,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Board had \u201cfail[ed] to adequately \nexplain why it could not employ \u2018some degree of fore-\ncasting\u2019 to identify the aforementioned upstream and \ndownstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a (citation omitted; first \nand second set of brackets in original).  \nThe court of appeals then rejected the contention \nthat, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public Citizen, su-\npra, the Board was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because of the Board\u2019s view that it \u201clack[ed] \nauthority to prevent, control, or mitigate those develop-\n\n15 \n \nments.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.  The court reasoned that the \nBoard had the authority to prevent those effects be-\ncause the Board has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the \nconstruction and operation of the railway, including au-\nthority to deny the exemption petition if the environ-\nmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its trans-\nportation benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c), \n10901(b)).  The court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis \nauthorized to license railroad construction and opera-\ntion based on the \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019 \nwhich encompasses reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based on \nthat analysis, the court decided that \u201cthe Board\u2019s argu-\nment that it need not consider effects it cannot prevent\u201d \nwas \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals found a number of other flaws \nin the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including a failure to \ntake a hard look at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline of the 85 miles of new line, Pet. App. 40a-42a, \nthe risk and impacts of wildfires downline caused by \nsparks from the operation of additional trains, id. at \n42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s impacts on water resources \ndownline on the Colorado River, id. at 46a-47a.  The \ncourt rejected or declined to reach multiple other chal-\nlenges under NEPA and the National Historic Preser-\nvation Act.  Id. at 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  And \nthe court found that there were flaws in the biological \nopinion that the Fish and Wildlife Service had provided \nin connection with the project under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemp-\ntion decision under the Interstate Commerce Act, id. at \n57a-69a.  Petitioners did not seek review of those other \nissues.  \n\n16 \n \nBased on the errors the court of appeals found in the \nNEPA analysis and the biological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] \nto conduct a reasoned application\u201d of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and the Board\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the \n[railway\u2019s] uncertain financial viability and the full po-\ntential for environmental harm against the transporta-\ntion benefits,\u201d the court vacated the Board\u2019s exemption \norder as arbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated \nthe environmental impact statement and biological \nopinion.  Pet. App. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n5. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied.  Pet. App. 72a-73a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA did not require the Board to undertake addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development in determining \nwhether to authorize the construction and operation of \nthe proposed railroad line in this case.  The court of ap-\npeals\u2019 contrary decision on that issue should be re-\nversed. \nA. \u201cNEPA declares a broad national commitment to \nprotecting and promoting environmental quality.\u201d  Rob-\nertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, \n348 (1989).  But it is \u201cwell settled that NEPA itself does \nnot mandate particular results.\u201d  Id. at 350.  Rather, the \nstatute realizes its environmental policy goals\u2014i.e., \n\u201cencourag[ing] productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] efforts \nwhich will prevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment,\u201d and \u201cenrich[ing] the understanding of the eco-\nlogical systems and natural resources important to  \nthe Nation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4321\u2014through \u201ca set of \u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u200a\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences,\u201d Robertson, \n\n17 \n \n490 U.S. at 350 (citation omitted).  At the heart of \nNEPA\u2019s procedural mandates is the requirement that \nagencies must prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d analyzing \n\u201cenvironmental effects\u201d before undertaking \u201cmajor \nFederal actions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural mandate is subject to cer-\ntain limits.  Longstanding CEQ regulations, now codi-\nfied in the statute, provide that an agency need only ex-\namine the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects of a pro-\nposed action.  See 2023 Act, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38; \n40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979).  In addition, this Court has \nstressed that NEPA does not rely on a \u201cbut-for\u201d stand-\nard of causation; rather, an agency is only required to \nexamine the effects for which the agency\u2019s action is the \n\u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 769 (2004).  That causal \nlimit permits an agency to exclude from its analysis any \neffects the agency \u201chas no ability to prevent  * * *  due \nto its limited statutory authority over the relevant ac-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 770. \nMoreover, even where an agency\u2019s statutory author-\nity is not so strictly limited, the agency may take ac-\ncount of a variety of context-specific factors in deter-\nmining whether and to what extent the proposed agency \naction is the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of a particular \nharm.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  Thus, an agency \nmay reasonably determine that\u2014based on the scope of \nthe proposed action and the nature and reach of the \nagency\u2019s organic statutes\u2014a harm is so attenuated, \nspeculative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently ma-\nterial to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking that the necessary \ncausal connection is absent or diminished.  Id. at 767.  \nAnd the fact that other governmental entities authorize, \n\n18 \n \nfund, or carry out the specific conduct that gives rise to \nthe environmental issues may likewise inform an agen-\ncy\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship\u201d between its own actions and partic-\nular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).  In these various circumstances, the agency \nmay draw a \u201cmanageable line\u201d that excludes any analy-\nsis of a harm if a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d \nis absent or that minimizes the analysis of a harm where \nthe causal connection is less robust.  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).   \nB. That does not mean that an agency may impose \nartificial restrictions on its NEPA analysis.  An agency \nmay not, for example, exclude consideration of an effect \nmerely because the agency does not directly regulate it \nor because other agencies share regulatory authority in \nthe relevant arena.  Nor may an agency impose arbi-\ntrary bright-line limits based on rigid measures of geo-\ngraphic distance, the timing of an effect, or the number \nof other actors that may contribute to it.  And agencies \ncannot apply the same tort-law standards of proximate \ncause given NEPA\u2019s different purposes and framework.  \nAgencies must instead draw context-specific causal \nlines that accord with \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.   \nC. In this case, the Board drew a reasonable line in \ndeclining to undertake more detailed analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement supporting \nthe authorization of a new railroad line from the Uinta \nBasin.  The Board authorizes railroad construction and \noperation, not the development and use of the commod-\nities that travel over those lines.  Indeed, the Board is \n\n19 \n \nrequired to enforce a common-carrier obligation that \ngenerally prohibits carriers from declining to provide \ntransport based on the nature of the commodity.  And \nother entities, including in some instances other federal \nagencies, have the authority to approve oil and gas de-\nvelopment projects in the Uinta Basin and to regulate \nthe localized effects of refining at the place where oil \nfrom the Basin might ultimately be transported.   \nGiven this statutory framework, the Board explained \nthat the scope of the proposed action was properly char-\nacterized as a decision to permit the construction of a \nnew railroad line providing common carrier service, ra-\nther than a decision to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  The Board also cited many factors that estab-\nlished that the \u201cenvironmental impacts that could po-\ntentially result from potential future oil and gas devel-\nopment projects\u201d were speculative, contingent, and at-\ntenuated from the Board\u2019s proposed action.  J.A. 529.    \nThe Board therefore made a reasonable determina-\ntion not to undertake additional or more detailed analy-\nsis of the upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development.  J.A. 520-529.  Because that de-\ntermination was not arbitrary or capricious, the court of \nappeals erred in setting it aside, and the court\u2019s decision \non this issue should be reversed.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD REASONA-\nBLY LIMITED ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE UPSTREAM \nAND DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF PETITIONERS\u2019 PRO-\nPOSED RAIL LINE \nNEPA embodies a \u201cnational commitment to protect-\ning and promoting environmental quality,\u201d imple-\nmented primarily through a procedural requirement for \nagencies to analyze the significant environmental ef-\n\n20 \n \nfects of their major actions.  Robertson v. Methow Val-\nley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989).  Agencies \nmust adhere to NEPA\u2019s procedural command, but the \nstatutory text, this Court\u2019s precedents, and CEQ\u2019s reg-\nulations all recognize that, in preparing its environmen-\ntal impact statement, an agency has considerable lati-\ntude and may draw manageable, context-specific lines \nthat take into account whether and to what extent \nharms have a reasonably close causal relationship to the \nagency\u2019s action and are sufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to further NEPA\u2019s purposes.  \nThe agency\u2019s factual findings and exercise of its expert \njudgment and discretion in determining the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement may be set aside only \nif they are arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 763 \n(2004); Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. \n360, 375-376 (1989). \nIn determining the scope of their environmental \nanalyses, agencies may not impose categorical or artifi-\ncial limits that exclude information about environmen-\ntal harms that have a reasonably close causal connection \nand would materially assist the agency in its decision-\nmaking or the public in providing meaningful input.  But \nin this case, the Board did not rely on any such arbitrary \nlimits.  Rather, the Board relied on several context- \nspecific factors to conclude that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences of oil and gas development \nwere too attenuated, speculative, contingent, and other-\nwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s decisionmak-\ning to warrant additional consideration in the environ-\nmental impact statement.  The Board\u2019s decision was not \narbitrary and capricious, and the court of appeals erred \nin holding otherwise.   \n\n21 \n \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope of Their Envi-\nronmental Impact Statements \nWhen Congress first enacted NEPA in 1970, it re-\nquired agencies to prepare \u201cdetailed statement[s]\u201d ana-\nlyzing \u201cthe environmental impact of\u200a\u201d a proposed major \nfederal action, as well as (among other things) \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which c[ould not] be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  \u00a7102(c)(i) and \n(ii); 83 Stat. 853 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) and (ii) (1970)).  \nCongress did not define the terms \u201cenvironmental im-\npact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[].\u201d  Ibid.  But this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, longstanding practice, and recent NEPA \namendments establish that agencies need only consider \nthe reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences \nfor which the agency action is a \u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769; see 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C) \n(requiring a \u201cdetailed statement by the responsible of-\nficial on\u2014(i) reasonably foreseeable environmental ef-\nfects of the proposed agency action\u201d).  Moreover, an \nagency\u2019s determination regarding the scope of its envi-\nronmental analysis is necessarily informed by NEPA\u2019s \npurposes and its \u201crule of reason,\u201d as well as the nature \nand scope of the agency\u2019s substantive authority.  And \nthe determination is reviewed under the APA\u2019s defer-\nential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard.   \nUnder those principles, an agency may draw a man-\nageable, context-specific line that differentiates be-\ntween (1) the significant environmental harms for which \nthe agency\u2019s action is the legally relevant cause and \nwhich will inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and the \npublic\u2019s input, and (2) the potential harms that are more \nattenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuf-\nficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking, such \n\n22 \n \nthat their consideration is less likely to serve NEPA\u2019s \npurposes or satisfy its rule of reason.  For harms in the \nlatter category, the reasonably close causal connection \nmay be missing entirely, such that the agency need not \nconsider the harm at all, or the connection may be suf-\nficiently removed that the agency may give the harm \nonly limited consideration. \n1.  NEPA plainly requires that an effect be \u201creason-\nably foreseeable\u201d in order to necessitate inclusion in an \nenvironmental impact statement.  CEQ regulations have \nlong provided that agencies should consider the \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of their pro-\nposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. at 56,004; 40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) \n(2019).  In 2020, CEQ amended its regulations to clarify \nthat \u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d means \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(aa) (2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(ii) (2024) (same).  And in 2023, Congress codified \nthis requirement by amending NEPA to specify that  \nan agency must examine the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see 2023 Act \u00a7321(a)(3)(B), 137 \nStat. 38.   \nNEPA also permits agencies to refrain from analyz-\ning an effect for which the agency\u2019s action is not the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  \nThus, in Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against \nNuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), the Court held \nthat NEPA does not incorporate a standard of \u201c\u200a\u2018but for\u2019 \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 774.  Rather, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmen-\ntal effect\u2019\u200a\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably close causal relationship between a change \n\n23 \n \nin the physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  \nIbid.  The Court reiterated that principle in Public Cit-\nizen, holding that \u201ca \u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is in-\nsufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular \neffect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.\u201d  541 \nU.S. at 767.  And the Court explained that it is neces-\nsary to look at NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies or legisla-\ntive intent in order to draw a manageable line between \nthose causal changes that may make an actor responsi-\nble for an effect and those that do not.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nMetropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).   \nThere is considerable overlap among these princi-\nples.  Reasonable foreseeability plays an important role \nin many statutory causation standards.  See, e.g., CSX \nTransp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 703 (2011) (dis-\ncussing the role of reasonable foreseeability for deter-\nmining causation under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liabil-\nity Act, 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.).  And Congress\u2019s recent \namendments to NEPA confirm that agencies must look \nto whether a consequence is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), in drawing the \u201cmanageable \nline\u201d that Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen con-\ntemplate, Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.3  But the re-\n \n3  The overlap is also reflected in CEQ\u2019s 2022 amendments remov-\ning the term \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d from its NEPA \nregulations.  CEQ had added that term, drawn from the Court\u2019s \nopinions in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, for the first \ntime in 2020 to clarify that agencies may look to the attenuated na-\nture of an effect in determining the appropriate scope of their \nNEPA analyses.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343-43,344.  When CEQ \nsubsequently removed that term from the regulations in 2022, it ex-\nplained that it was not disregarding \u201can agency\u2019s ability to exclude \neffects too attenuated from its actions.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. 23, 453, 23,465 \n(Apr. 20, 2022).  Rather, CEQ indicated that the requirement of a \n \n\n24 \n \nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and causation \nare not identical.  For example, Public Citizen recog-\nnized that, even when an environmental harm is \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d in the abstract or as a factual mat-\nter, id. at 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation \nstandard is not met if the agency \u201chas no ability to pre-\nvent\u201d the harm \u201cdue to its limited statutory authority \nover the relevant actions,\u201d id. at 770.   \nIn Public Citizen, the Court considered whether an \nagency had permissibly excluded certain environmental \neffects from its NEPA analysis based on the agency\u2019s \nlimited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  The case \ninvolved a NEPA challenge to safety regulations for \nMexican trucks that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration (FMCSA) promulgated after the Presi-\ndent decided to lift a moratorium on the entry of Mexi-\ncan trucks.  Id. at 756, 760.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analy-\nsis considered the environmental consequences of the \nroadside inspections of the Mexican trucks required by \nthe agency\u2019s new safety rules.  Id. at 761.  But the anal-\nysis did not consider the consequences of the increased \npresence of Mexican trucks in the United States be-\ncause FMCSA determined that the increased presence \nwas due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the morato-\nrium rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  Ibid.   \nSeveral challengers asserted that limiting the NEPA \nanalysis in that way was improper because the trucks \n \n\u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d was already captured by the \npre-2020 regulation\u2019s longstanding principle of \u201creasonable foresee-\nability,\u201d ibid., and the requirement that effects must be caused by \nthe agency.  Deleting the phrase that had been added by the 2020 \nregulations did not affect the courts\u2019 ability to consider whether \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d between the agency\u2019s \naction and a particular harm in reviewing whether an agency acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to assess that harm.     \n\n25 \n \ncould not enter the United States until the agency \npromulgated its regulations.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 765-766.  In the challengers\u2019 view, that made FMSCA \nthe \u201ccause\u200a\u201d of the entry of Mexican trucks.  Id. at 766.  \nBecause the President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium and \nthe entry of the trucks were also \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble,\u201d the challengers argued that NEPA required the \nagency to consider the environmental consequences of \nthe trucks\u2019 entry.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nThe Court rejected that argument, holding that \nNEPA does not require the \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation\u201d the challengers had proposed.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  Instead, agencies may draw \ncausal lines based on \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in the statute.  Id. at 768.  That \u201c\u200a\u2018rule \nof reason,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Court explained, \u201censures that agencies \ndetermine whether and to what extent to prepare an \n[environmental impact statement] based on the useful-\nness of any new potential information to the deci-\nsionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767.  And the \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d is not satisfied where consideration of a particular \nenvironmental harm would not serve NEPA\u2019s goals of \nproviding information to the agency to assist in its deci-\nsional process and to the public to enable it to offer \nmeaningful input.  Ibid. \nApplying those principles in Public Citizen, the \nCourt held that FMSCA could not be considered the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause\u201d of the increased presence of Mex-\nican trucks and their attendant emissions in the United \nStates.  541 U.S. at 769.  The Court explained that \nFMSCA had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating within \n\n26 \n \nthe United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the \nCourt explained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statu-\ntory mandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize opera-\ntions by a Mexican motor carrier that was \u201cwilling and \nable to comply with\u201d FMCSA\u2019s safety regulations based \non concerns about the trucks\u2019 emissions, and thus to \npreclude the trucks\u2019 entry altogether.  Ibid.  In those \ncircumstances, the Court determined that FMSCA\u2019s ac-\ntions were not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of any in-\ncreased emissions from the trucks, and explained that \nrequiring the agency to consider information about any \nincrease in emissions would not satisfy NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason\u201d or its statutory purposes because the agency \nwas powerless to act on that information.  Id. at 767-769.  \n2.  Public Citizen establishes that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm might be \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d it \nmay still be excluded from an environmental impact \nstatement where the agency lacks the ability to prevent \nthe harm.  In those instances, the requisite \u201ccausal con-\nnection\u201d is missing, and the environmental harm cannot \nbe considered an \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201ceffect\u201d of the agency\u2019s ac-\ntion for purposes of NEPA.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n768.  That is clearly the case where, as in Public Citizen, \nthe governing statutes prohibit the agency from taking \nthe action necessary to stop the relevant harm from oc-\ncurring.  Id. at 769-770.  And it is also the case where \nthe decisions that give rise to the relevant effect are \ncommitted to the exclusive control of another agency.  \nSee Sierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (finding that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission was not required \u201cto address the indirect \neffects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d as part \nof its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new natural \ngas facilities because \u201cthe Department of Energy, not \n\n27 \n \nthe Commission, has sole authority to license the export \nof any natural gas going through the [new] facilities\u201d) \n(emphasis omitted).4  \nBut Public Citizen\u2019s reasoning indicates that an \nagency may also find that the requisite causal connec-\ntion is absent or diminished where the scope of the \nagency action and the nature and requirements of the \ngoverning statutes render a particular harm too atten-\nuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuffi-\nciently material to the agency decision under consider-\nation.  Where an agency makes such a reasonable,  \ncontext-specific determination, the agency is entitled to \n\u201cdraw a manageable line\u201d that excludes any considera-\ntion of harms where a \u201creasonably close causal connec-\ntion\u201d is absent, or that appropriately limits the analysis \nof harms where the causal connection is simply less ro-\nbust.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citations omitted).  \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d are not served by addi-\ntional analysis of a harm that is too attenuated, specu-\nlative, or contingent to influence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking or to provide \u201c\u200a\u2018a springboard\u2019\u200a\u201d for mean-\ningful public comments.  Id. at 768 (citation omitted).  \nAnd it would not \u201csatisfy NEPA\u2019s \u2018rule of reason\u2019 to re-\n \n4  In their certiorari-stage briefing, petitioners asserted (Pet. 24-\n25) that CEQ\u2019s recent amendments to its NEPA regulations have \ninappropriately narrowed the scope of Public Citizen by disregard-\ning the proposition that an agency may exclude environmental ef-\nfects that it has no power to prevent.  In fact, in the preamble to its \n2022 revisions to the NEPA regulations, CEQ merely explained that \nthe Court\u2019s description of the causation issue in Public Citizen was \nnecessarily informed by the particular context of the case, in which \nthe agency was affirmatively barred by statute from acting on the \nbasis of the alleged environmental harm.  CEQ\u2019s discussion was not \nintended to place limits on an agency\u2019s discretion beyond those im-\nposed by the statute itself.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 23,464-23,465.   \n\n28 \n \nquire an agency to\u201d analyze a harm when it has con-\ncluded that the harm is too far afield from the agency\u2019s \naction to make \u201cany new potential information\u201d useful \nto the agency\u2019s \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767, \n769.   \n3.  This Court\u2019s cases regarding the standard of judi-\ncial review of the scope of an environmental impact \nstatement further establish that agencies are afforded \nconsiderable latitude and discretion in determining the \nbounds of their NEPA analyses based on these consid-\nerations.  The Court has repeatedly recognized that an \nagency\u2019s decision about whether and how to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement \u201ccan be set aside only \nupon a showing that it was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.\u2019\u200a\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 763 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n706(2)(A)); see, e.g., Marsh, 490 U.S. at 375.  The Court \nhas also stressed that a reviewing court should not treat \nan agency\u2019s factual determination regarding whether \nan environmental effect requires additional analysis as \na \u201clegal question\u201d subject to searching review.  Marsh, \n490 U.S. at 376.  A \u201ccourt need only decide whether the \nagency decision was \u2018arbitrary and capricious.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at \n375.  And under that standard, a court should not reject \nan agency\u2019s decision unless the agency has made a \n\u201c\u200a\u2018clear error of judgment,\u2019\u200a\u201d even if the court believes \nthat \u201canother decisionmaker might have reached a con-\ntrary result.\u201d  Id. at 385.   \nIn Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390 (1976), for ex-\nample, the Court held that \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbi-\ntrary action,\u201d a reviewing court \u201cmust assume\u201d that the \nagency has \u201cexercised [its] discretion appropriately\u201d in \ndeciding the scope of its environmental impact state-\nment.  Id. at 412.  In considering the environmental im-\n\n29 \n \npacts at issue in that case, including the \u201c[d]iminished \navailability of water, air and water pollution, increases \nin population and industrial densities, and perhaps even \nclimatic changes,\u201d the Court held that the \u201cdetermina-\ntion of the extent and effect of these factors, and partic-\nularly identification of the geographic area within which \nthey may occur, is a task assigned to the special compe-\ntency of the appropriate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 413-414.  The \nCourt therefore recognized that the proper scope of a \nNEPA analysis calls for a context-specific determina-\ntion that depends on the nature of the decision before \nthe agency and its assessment of the facts on the \nground.    \n4. CEQ\u2019s current regulations reinforce the principle \nthat an agency may reasonably determine the scope of \nits NEPA analysis by assessing the extent to which en-\nvironmental harms may be too attenuated, speculative, \nor otherwise insufficiently material to inform the agen-\ncy\u2019s decisionmaking and to assist the public in providing \nmeaningful input into that decisionmaking.  \nCEQ regulations provide that an agency must con-\nsider the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d \nand \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of its actions, and the defini-\ntions of those terms make clear that agencies cannot ar-\nbitrarily limit their analysis based on rigid measures of \ngeographic distance, timing, or the number of other \ncontributors to the effect.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (capitali-\nzation omitted).5  But the regulations also expressly \n \n5  In preparing the environmental impact statement in this case, \nthe Board applied CEQ\u2019s pre-2020 regulations, Pet. App. 26a, which \nare substantially similar to the current regulations.  In 2020, CEQ \namended its regulations to eliminate the distinction among cumula-\ntive, indirect, and direct effects.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343.  But in \n \n\n30 \n \ncontemplate that agencies will engage in a \u201cscoping\u201d \nprocess at the outset of any environmental review to en-\nsure that the agency focuses its attention on the effects \nthat are most important to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking \nwith respect to the project at hand.  See 40 C.F.R. \n1501.3(b), 1501.9(b), 1502.4.  As part of the scoping pro-\ncess, the agency is required to \u201cidentify[] the important \nissues and eliminat[e] from further study unimportant \nissues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues that \u201chave \nbeen covered by prior environmental review(s),\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  Similarly, CEQ\u2019s regulations \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d \nproviding \u201conly brief discussion of other than important \nissues.\u201d  40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b).  And the regulations pro-\nvide that the length of environmental impact statements \n\u201cshould be proportional to potential environmental ef-\nfects and the scope and complexity of the action.\u201d   \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(c). \n*  *  *  *  * \nIn short, NEPA and its implementing regulations, as \nwell as this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents, establish that an \nagency is not required to consider every environmental \nharm that the agency can reasonably foresee.  Rather, \nthe agency may draw a manageable causal line that ex-\ncludes the harms that the agency lacks the statutory au-\nthority to prevent, and that takes account of whether \nand to what extent particular harms are too attenuated, \nspeculative, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to serve NEPA\u2019s purposes and \nsatisfy its rule of reason, given the scope and nature of \nthe agency action and the governing statutes.      \n \n2022, CEQ reestablished those longstanding categories.  See 87 \nFed. Reg. at 23,462-23,463.   \n\n31 \n \nB. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Suggest That An \nAgency May Impose Limits On Its Environmental Anal-\nysis That Do Not Comport With NEPA\u2019s Text Or Under-\nlying Policies \nAlthough NEPA and its implementing regulations \npermit an agency to refrain from analyzing environ-\nmental effects under the principles described above, an \nagency may not impose limits on the scope of its analy-\nsis that conflict with the statutory text or \u201cthe underly-\ning policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent.\u201d  Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.  In their certiorari-stage \nbriefing, petitioners appeared to endorse three such un-\nsupported, extra-textual limits:  (1) that agencies may \nrestrict their analysis to the effects they directly regu-\nlate, rather than relying on the nature of their statutory \nauthority to inform a context-specific inquiry regarding \nthe appropriate scope of the agency\u2019s environmental im-\npact statement; (2) that agencies should base their anal-\nysis of causation on substantive standards from tort \nlaw, rather than treating the \u201c\u200a\u2018familiar doctrine of prox-\nimate cause from tort law\u2019\u200a\u201d as an \u201canalog[y]\u201d and look-\ning to NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and rule of reason in \ndrawing their causal lines, id. at 767 (citation omitted); \nand (3) that agencies may eschew the context-specific \ninquiry NEPA requires in favor of broad and bright-line \nrules based on geography, timing, or the specific num-\nber of contributors to the particular harm.  Each of \nthose arguments lacks merit. \n1. At the certiorari stage, petitioners repeatedly as-\nserted that \u201cagencies need not study environmental ef-\nfects that they do not regulate.\u201d  Pet. 14 (emphasis omit-\nted); see, e.g., Pet. 4, 21.  To the extent petitioners mean \nto suggest that agencies are not required to consider ef-\nfects if they have no statutory power to prevent those \n\n32 \n \neffects, that is nothing more than a restatement of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding.  But if petitioners instead mean \nthat agencies never have to consider environmental ef-\nfects they do not directly regulate\u2014that is, that they \nmay ignore effects they are not expressly charged with \noverseeing under their organic statutes\u2014then petition-\ners\u2019 argument is contradicted by NEPA\u2019s text.   \nNEPA contains an express requirement that agen-\ncies \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments of any \nFederal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special \nexpertise with respect to any environmental impact in-\nvolved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  That provision tells an agency what it \nshould do when the environmental consequences of its \nproposed action implicate another agency\u2019s regulatory \njurisdiction, rather than (or in addition to) its own.  The \nagency preparing the environmental impact statement \nmust \u201cconsult\u201d with the other agency, 42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C), and it may also make the other agency a \u201cco-\noperating agency,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3).  Moreover, if \nthe other agency has analyzed or will analyze the effect, \nthat analysis can be incorporated by reference, thereby \navoiding inefficiencies.  See 40 C.F.R. 1501.2, 1502.4(d)(1).  \nWhat the agency may not do is disregard an effect en-\ntirely based solely on the fact that another agency has \nmore direct \u201cjurisdiction by law\u201d over the effect.  42 \nU.S.C. 4336a(a)(3). \nMoreover, confining agencies\u2019 NEPA obligations to \nthe consideration of environmental effects they already \ndirectly regulate would contravene Congress\u2019s com-\n\n33 \n \nmand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Government\u201d \nshall \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d comply with the ob-\nligation to prepare an environmental impact statement \nin connection with their major actions that have signifi-\ncant environmental effects.  42 U.S.C. 4332 (emphasis \nadded).  If agencies were to exclude environmental ef-\nfects that are not within their direct regulatory jurisdic-\ntion, the many federal agencies that have no direct ju-\nrisdiction over environmental issues under their or-\nganic statutes would have no NEPA obligations at all, \nand the obligations of other agencies would shrink dras-\ntically.  That is the opposite of what Congress required.  \nInterpreting NEPA to permit agencies to ignore any \neffect they do not directly regulate would also render \nthe statute\u2019s procedural commands largely nugatory.  \nNEPA was enacted to ensure that agencies \u201cwill have \navailable, and will carefully consider, detailed infor-\nmation concerning significant environmental impacts.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768 (citation omitted).  If the \nagency already directly regulates the environmental ef-\nfects in question, it does not need NEPA to ensure that \nit has relevant information in front of it.  That cannot be \nwhat Congress intended when it enacted its landmark \nstatute establishing a \u201cnational policy [to] encourage \nproductive and enjoyable harmony between man and \nhis environment,\u201d and to promote better environmental \ndecisionmaking while enriching the understanding of \nthe Nation\u2019s important natural resources.  42 U.S.C. \n4321.6    \n \n6  See Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs, National Environ-\nmental Policy Act of 1969, S. Rep. No. 296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 8 \n(1969) (Senate Report) (noting \u201crising public concern over the man-\nner in which Federal policies and activities have contributed to en-\n \n\n34 \n \n2. a. Petitioners also repeatedly suggest (e.g., Pet. \n4, 16, 23) that NEPA requires the application of the \nsame proximate cause standards from tort law.  Again, \npetitioners are correct to the extent they merely mean \nto assert that NEPA does not require an agency to as-\nsess all effects under a standard of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation \nand instead permits agencies to exclude harms for \nwhich their actions are not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d; \nindeed, that is simply a restatement of the Court\u2019s hold-\nings in Public Citizen.  541 U.S. at 767, 769.  But recog-\nnizing that the agency\u2019s action must be the \u201clegally rel-\nevant cause\u201d of an environmental harm does not equate \nto a holding that NEPA incorporates the same proxi-\nmate cause standards from tort law or require agencies \nto turn to tort law as the basis of analysis.   \nTo the contrary, this Court has expressly rejected \nthe proposition that \u201cany cause-effect relation too at-\ntenuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be \ntoo attenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental im-\npact statement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Thus, while both Metropolitan Edison and Public \nCitizen \u201canalogized\u201d NEPA\u2019s requirement of a \u201creason-\nably close causal relationship\u201d to \u201cthe \u2018familiar doctrine \n \nvironmental decay and degradation,\u201d and citing examples such as \n\u201cthe Santa Barbara oil well blowout,\u201d \u201cthe proliferation of pesticides \nand other chemicals,\u201d \u201cthe indiscriminate siting of  * * *  heavy in-\ndustry,\u201d \u201cthe pollution of the Nation\u2019s rivers, bays, lakes, and estu-\naries,\u201d \u201cthe loss of publicly owned  * * *  open spaces  * * *  to indus-\ntry, commercial users, and developers,\u201d and \u201crising levels of air pol-\nlution.\u201d); see id. at 4 (discussing \u201c[t]he inadequacy of present know-\nledge, policies, and institutions,\u201d as reflected in problems such as \n\u201ccritical air and water pollution problems,\u201d \u201cdiminishing recreational \nopportunity,\u201d \u201crising levels of noise,\u201d \u201can increasingly ugly landscape \ncluttered with billboards, powerlines, and junkyards,\u201d and \u201cmany, \nmany other environmental quality problems\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nof proximate cause from tort law,\u2019\u200a\u201d the comparison was \nintended to illustrate that NEPA causation turns on the \nresponsibility of the federal agency; it was not intended \nto suggest that tort law itself should be used to define \nthe scope of an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation omitted).  Rather, in draw-\ning causal lines in the two cases, the Court looked to the \n\u201cunderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 in-\ntent.\u201d  Id. at 768. \nThat is readily apparent in Public Citizen, where the \nCourt relied on an analysis of NEPA\u2019s purposes and its \n\u201crule of reason\u201d in concluding that the agency did not \nneed to consider the effects of the increased presence of \nMexican trucks in the United States.  541 U.S. 767; see \npp. 24-25, supra.  But it is equally true of Metropolitan \nEdison.  In that case, the Court looked to NEPA\u2019s un-\nderlying purposes to determine whether the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was required to consider the \npsychological harms caused by the fear of nuclear acci-\ndents before authorizing a nuclear power plant to re-\nsume operations.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at \n770-771.  The Court determined that the agency was not \nrequired to consider those harms because NEPA\u2019s \n\u201ccentral concern\u201d is whether a project\u2019s \u201cgains are \nworth a given level of alteration of our physical environ-\nment or depletion of our natural resources,\u201d not \nwhether a project\u2019s gains are \u201cworth its attendant \nrisks.\u201d  Id. at 775-776.  The causal analysis was there-\nfore focused on the extent to which the effect in question \nwas one that Congress would have intended to cover.   \nb. Further, NEPA is distinct from the federal stat-\nutes that this Court has held incorporate a proximate \ncause standard borrowed from tort law.  Those statutes \ntypically permit the award of damages against private \n\n36 \n \nparties found liable for specific harms, making the anal-\nogy to the common law of torts relatively close.  See, \ne.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n201 (2017) (Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., \ndamages suit); Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014) (damages \nunder the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).  By con-\ntrast, NEPA does not allocate responsibility for a par-\nticular harm or impose monetary damages.  Instead, \nNEPA seeks to \u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d \nharms by ensuring that federal agencies consider the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 756 (citation omitted).  There is no \nreason to think that, in enacting a statute designed to \n\u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d harm, Congress \nintended to draw the same causal lines that the tort sys-\ntem uses to allocate blame among private parties for \nharms that have already occurred.  Nor is it plausible \nthat, in imposing NEPA\u2019s purely \u201cprocedural require-\nments,\u201d ibid., Congress intended to require the precise \nkind of causal connection that is necessary to justify \nmonetary damages.    \nc. Simply engrafting the same proximate cause \nstandard from tort law onto NEPA would also introduce \nunnecessary confusion into the statutory scheme.  \n\u201c\u200a\u2018[P]roximate cause\u2019\u200a\u201d is a term that has been used to \nrefer to a variety of different things, including \u201cthe \u2018im-\nmediate\u2019 or \u2018nearest\u2019 antecedent test; the \u2018efficient, pro-\nducing cause\u2019 test; the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test; and the \n\u2018probable,\u2019 or \u2018natural and probable,\u2019 or \u2018foreseeable\u2019 \nconsequence test.\u201d  CSX Transp., 564 U.S. at 701.  \nAgencies and courts attempting to make sense of the \nterm would be likely to come to diverging results about \nwhat must be included in an environmental impact \n\n37 \n \nstatement.  And that is all the more likely because the \nCourt has emphasized that, even when a federal statute \nincorporates tort principles of proximate cause, the con-\ntours of the analysis must nonetheless be drawn to re-\nflect \u201cthe nature of the statutory cause of action.\u201d  Bank \nof Am. Corp., 581 U.S.  at 201; see id. at 203 (remanding \nto the court of appeals to draw the \u201cprecise boundaries \nof proximate cause under the\u201d Fair Housing Act).  Ac-\ncordingly, if the Court were to conclude that NEPA in-\ncorporates tort law governing proximate cause, that ap-\nproach would still raise questions about what exactly \nthe standard means in this context.     \n3. It would be similarly erroneous to impose rigid \nbright-line rules that woodenly exclude harms based \nsolely on their geographic or temporal distance from \nthe agency action or based on the number of intervening \nsteps or the number of entities contributing to the \nharm.  As explained, see pp. 27-30, supra, an agency \nmay make a context-specific determination that, given \nthe nature of the proposed action and the governing \nstatutes, a particular harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking.  But that does not mean \nthat an agency can refuse to consider effects for which \nits actions are the legally relevant cause and which \nwould inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking merely be-\ncause those effects are geographically or temporally re-\nmoved or because other entities also play a role in \nbringing them about.   \nIndeed, many significant environmental harms\u2014in-\ncluding some of the very effects that prompted NEPA\u2019s \nenactment, like water contamination and smog\u2014are \ncaused by many parties that are geographically and \ntemporally removed from the location where the harm \n\n38 \n \nis most keenly felt.  Senate Report 8.  If agencies wood-\nenly applied bright-line rules based on geography, tim-\ning, or the specific number of other contributing actors, \nsome of these significant effects might be disregarded \nentirely by agencies whose actions make material con-\ntributions to the harms.   \n4. All of these arguments seemingly boil down to a \nrequest to impose new limits on NEPA\u2019s established \nframework.  The proper branch of government to ad-\ndress such requests is Congress.  And in this case, the \nrequest is particularly misplaced because Congress it-\nself recently amended NEPA without overriding this \nCourt\u2019s precedents or making any of the changes that \npetitioners now seek from this Court.   \nMoreover, many of Congress\u2019s recent amendments \nwere intended to address the process of developing an \nenvironmental impact statement.  In addition to codify-\ning the reasonable foreseeability requirement, 42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), Congress adopted new timing re-\nquirements and page limits, as well as new procedures \nfor inter-agency cooperation, see 42 U.S.C. 4336a.  Con-\ngress also made alterations to the conditions under \nwhich environmental impact statements are required, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. 4336, and established a set of new statu-\ntory definitions, including a new definition of the \u201cmajor \nFederal action[s]\u201d to which NEPA applies, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. 4336e(10).  Nor is this list comprehensive.  But \nCongress did not choose to make any changes that \nwould dramatically limit NEPA\u2019s reach in the way peti-\ntioners appear to advocate.     \n\n39 \n \nC. The Board Reasonably Declined To Perform Additional \nAnalysis Of The Upstream And Downstream Effects Of \nOil And Gas Development \nThe court of appeals also erred in interpreting and \napplying NEPA\u2019s statutory requirements.  The court \nheld that the agency was required to perform additional \nand more detailed analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development because the \neffects were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d and the Board\u2019s \nstatutory authority was broad enough to permit their \nconsideration.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  But the court failed \nto recognize that, even in those circumstances, an agen-\ncy may decline to perform additional analysis when it \nreasonably determines that the harms in question are \ntoo attenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise in-\nsufficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in \nlight of the nature of the proposed action and the stat-\nutes under which the agency is operating.  The Board \nmade such a reasonable determination here. \n1. As a threshold matter, the certiorari-stage brief-\ning has narrowed the scope of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision that is properly before this Court.  In their certi-\norari petition, petitioners focused their challenge exclu-\nsively on the court of appeals\u2019 assertedly erroneous in-\nterpretation of the NEPA causation standard articu-\nlated in Public Citizen.  See Pet. i.  Petitioners did not \nallege legal errors with respect to any other aspects of \nthe court\u2019s decision.  They did not challenge any of the \ncourt\u2019s findings that the Board erred in applying stat-\nutes other than NEPA.  And they did not focus their \nchallenge on aspects of the court\u2019s application of NEPA \nbeyond the court\u2019s determination that the Board could \nnot rely on Public Citizen to justify limiting its consid-\neration of the upstream and downstream effects of oil \n\n40 \n \nand gas development in its environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 36a-39a.   \nMoreover, in challenging the court of appeals\u2019 deter-\nmination that the Board\u2019s treatment of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development was \ninadequate, petitioners did not address the court\u2019s find-\ning that the effects were reasonably foreseeable.  And \npetitioners appeared to concede that the Board has the \npower to deny an exemption based on environmental ef-\nfects that it concludes are material to its decision.  See \nPet. 23.     \nWhen respondents described the limited nature of \npetitioners\u2019 challenge in their briefs in opposition (e.g., \nGov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 17-18), petitioners briefly asserted \n(Cert. Reply Br. 10) that they had somehow preserved \nan argument regarding the validity of the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 application of NEPA to certain \u201cdownline im-\npacts\u201d and that a ruling on their behalf would \u201cvindicate \nevery part of the Board\u2019s NEPA review.\u201d  But the only \ncitations to the petition that they offered in support \nwere to descriptions of the facts in the background sec-\ntion.  See id. at 9-10 (citing Pet. 10, 12).  And petitioners \nagain failed to contest (id. at 11) the court\u2019s determina-\ntion that the oil and gas development effects were \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable,\u201d while expressly conceding (ibid.) \nthat \u201cthe Board has authority to weigh environmental \neffects in its decisions.\u201d   \nAccordingly, the only aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that is properly before this Court is the holding \nthat Public Citizen did not permit the Board to forgo \nadditional and more detailed analysis of the upstream \nand downstream consequences of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement.    \n\n41 \n \n2. The court of appeals\u2019 decision on that issue was \nincorrect.  The court of appeals concluded that the up-\nstream and downstream consequences of oil and gas de-\nvelopment were reasonably foreseeable and that the \nBoard\u2019s organic statutes afforded it the authority to \nprevent those consequences from occurring by refusing \nto authorize the new railroad line.7  Even assuming \nthose conclusions were correct, the Board did not act \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to conduct fur-\nther analysis of the consequences in its environmental \nimpact statement.  Rather, the Board reasonably deter-\nmined that, based on the scope of the proposed action \nand the provisions of the Board\u2019s governing statutes, \nthe upstream and downstream consequences of oil and \ngas development were too attenuated, speculative, and \notherwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking to require additional consideration under \nNEPA.  Because the statute permits agencies to draw \nsuch a manageable causal line, the court of appeals \nerred in setting aside this aspect of the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion.   \na. To begin, this is not a case in which the agency \nfailed to identify potentially relevant effects, omitting \nthem from its environmental impact statement alto-\ngether.  To the contrary, the Board spent over 50 pages \nof its final environmental impact statement and its final \ndecision on the rail project discussing the environmen-\ntal consequences that might result from new oil and gas \ndrilling and refining occurring after completion of the \nrailway line.  Those discussions included both a qualita-\ntive analysis of the potential for new oil and gas devel-\n \n7  In its briefing before the court of appeals, the Board argued that \nneither conclusion was correct, but as explained, petitioners did not \nseek certiorari on those issues.  \n\n42 \n \nopment in the Basin, and quantitative estimates that the \nBoard found were likely to exaggerate the aggregate \namount of new crude oil that might be transported to \nrefineries and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 351-362, 365-474.   \nThe discussions also included detailed explanations \nof why additional environmental analysis was not nec-\nessary.  See J.A. 421, 477-482, 520-529; Pet. App. 107a-\n109a.  The Board did not rely on bright-line rules to ar-\nbitrarily exclude environmental information that might \nhave been useful to the agency in its decisionmaking \nprocess or to the public in commenting during the pro-\ncess.  Instead, the Board explained the various context-\nspecific factors that prompted it to conclude that addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development would not \u201cinform\u201d \nits decisionmaking.  J.A. 521; see J.A. 520-529.   \nSpecifically, the Board relied on its governing stat-\nutes to determine the appropriate scope of the agency \naction before it.  J.A. 522; see J.A. 421.  The Board ex-\nplained that it \u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation \nby rail carriers,\u201d citing 49 U.S.C. 10501 and 49 U.S.C. \n10502\u2019s mandate to grant exemptions based on the \ntransportation merits of a particular project.  J.A. 522.  \nThe Board also cited the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s \ncommon-carrier mandate, under which \u201crailroads have \na common carrier obligation to carry all commodities, \nincluding hazardous materials, upon reasonable request \nunder 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101,\u201d explaining that it \u201ctherefore \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines.\u201d  J.A. 421.  And the \nBoard observed that oil and gas development was \u201csub-\n\n43 \n \nject to the approval processes of other federal, state, lo-\ncal, and tribal agencies.\u201d  J.A. 522.8 \nBased on this statutory framework, the Board found \nthat it \u201clack[ed] sufficient control over future oil and gas \ndevelopment projects to make those projects part of the \nproposed action assessed in the [environmental impact \nstatement].\u201d  J.A. 523.  Further, drawing on the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act\u2019s common-carrier mandate, the \nBoard explained that\u2014while petitioners had proposed \nthe new railroad line to fill a need for better transpor-\ntation for crude oil\u2014petitioners\u2019 request for Board au-\nthorization was properly understood as a request to \nprovide \u201ccommon carrier rail service connecting the Ba-\nsin to the interstate common carrier rail network,\u201d ra-\nther than a request to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  J.A. 527.  \nIn addition, the Board listed a number of factors that \nled it to conclude that the environmental harms from \nany \u201cpotential future\u201d oil and gas development were too \nspeculative and attenuated from the proposed action of \nauthorizing the new railroad line to warrant more de-\ntailed consideration in the environmental impact state-\nment.  J.A. 527; see J.A. 527-528.  The Board observed, \nfor example, that any future oil and gas development in \nthe Basin would involve \u201cmany separate and independ-\n \n8  For instance, the Bureau of Land Management administers pub-\nlic lands in the Uinta Basin on which some of the oil and gas produc-\ntion would take place, and the Bureau has conducted NEPA analysis \nof the effects of various proposed oil and gas exploration and pro-\nduction projects in the Basin.  See Rocky Mountain Wild v. Bern-\nhardt, 506 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1177-1185 (D. Utah 2020); Southern \nUtah Wilderness All. v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. 13-\ncv-1060, 2016 WL 6909036, at *3-*13 (D. Utah Oct. 3, 2016); \nWildEarth Guardians v. United States Forest Serv., No. 14-cv-349, \n2021 WL 409827 (D. Utah Feb. 5, 2012). \n\n44 \n \nent projects that have not yet been proposed or \nplanned,\u201d and that might vary according to the land on \nwhich they are situated and the scale of the drilling op-\nerations.  JA. 528.  The Board also found that, while it \n\u201cis possible that\u201d increased oil production could lead to \nincreased oil refining by the Salt Lake City refineries \nthat currently accept Uinta Basin crude oil, that refin-\ning might increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \n\u201cdepend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard separately explained that it anticipated that most \noil would be shipped to refineries on the Gulf Coast and \nPuget Sound, but it noted that \u201c[t]he final destinations \nof the trains would depend on the ability and willingness \nof refineries in other markets to receive rail cars carry-\ning Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil in their re-\nfineries.\u201d  J.A. 477.  \nFurther, in its final decision authorizing construction \nof the new line, the Board reiterated its determinations \nregarding the scope of the proposed action, the limits of \nthe Board\u2019s authority, and the attenuated and specula-\ntive nature of the harms from oil and gas development \nand refining.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The Board repeated \nthat it was authorizing the construction of a new rail-\nroad line and that the Board lacked the \u201cauthority to \ncontrol or mitigate\u201d oil and gas development.  Id. at \n108a.  And the Board also repeated its finding that any \nnew oil and gas development in the Basin that \u201cmay oc-\ncur following authorization of [the new railroad line] \nwould entail many separate and independent projects \nthat have not yet been proposed or planned and that \ncould occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land and \ncould range in scale from a single vertical oil well to a \nlarge lease.\u201d  Ibid.  The Board also found that \u201cthe ac-\ntual volumes of crude oil that would move over the [new \n\n45 \n \nline] would depend on various independent variables \nand influences, including general domestic and global \neconomic conditions, commodity pricing, the strategic \nand capital investment decisions of oil producers, and \nfuture market demand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. \nat 106a.   \nb. The Board thus relied on the scope of the agency \naction and the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s relevant stat-\nutory provisions to come to the reasonable conclusion \nthat it was appropriate to forgo additional or more de-\ntailed analysis of harms that the Board found too atten-\nuated and speculative to inform its decisionmaking.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.  That determination \naccords with the principles of causation articulated in \nPublic Citizen, as well as longstanding NEPA prece-\ndents and CEQ regulations, all of which establish that \nan agency has the discretion to make context-specific \ndeterminations regarding the scope of its environmen-\ntal impact statement.  The court of appeals therefore \nhad no basis for finding that the Board\u2019s determination \nwas arbitrary and capricious or otherwise contrary to \napplicable law.   \nAccordingly, the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision holding that the Board erred in declining to un-\ndertake additional analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development should be re-\nversed.   \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed in relevant part, and the case should be re-\nmanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings \nconsistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \nANIKA SANDERS COOPER \nGeneral Counsel \nBARBARA MILLER \nAttorney \nSurface Transportation \nBoard  \n \nELIZABETH B.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, \nthe remedies provided under this part with respect to \nregulation of rail transportation are exclusive and \npreempt the remedies provided under Federal or State \nlaw. \n(c)(1)  In this subsection\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe term \u201clocal governmental authority\u201d\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas the same meaning given that term by \nsection 5302 of this title; and \n \n(ii) \nincludes a person or entity that contracts \nwith the local governmental authority to provide \ntransportation services; and \n\n9a \n \n \n(B) \nthe term \u201cpublic transportation\u201d means \ntransportation services described in section 5302 of \nthis title that are provided by rail. \n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Board \ndoes not have jurisdiction under this part over\u2014 \n \n(A) \npublic transportation provided by a local \ngovernment authority; or \n \n(B) \na solid waste rail transfer facility as defined \nin section 10908 of this title, except as provided under \nsections 10908 and 10909 of this title. \n(3)(A)  Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this sub-\nsection, a local governmental authority, described in \nparagraph (2), is subject to applicable laws of the United \nStates related to\u2014 \n \n(i) \nsafety; \n \n(ii) \nthe representation of employees for collec-\ntive bargaining; and \n \n(iii) \nemployment, retirement, annuity, and un-\nemployment systems or other provisions related to \ndealings between employees and employers. \n(B) The Board has jurisdiction under sections 11102 \nand 11103 of this title over transportation provided by a \nlocal governmental authority only if the Board finds that \nsuch governmental authority meets all of the standards \nand requirements for being a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission that were in effect imme-\ndiately before January 1, 1996.  The enactment of the \nICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor \ncontract coverage of employees and employers by the \nRailway Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of \n\n10a \n \n1974, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad \nUnemployment Insurance Act. \n \n4. \n49 U.S.C. 10502 provides: \nAuthority to exempt rail carrier transportation \n(a) In a matter related to a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board \nunder this part, the Board, to the maximum extent con-\nsistent with this part, shall exempt a person, class of \npersons, or a transaction or service whenever the Board \nfinds that the application in whole or in part of a provi-\nsion of this part\u2014 \n \n(1) \nis not necessary to carry out the transporta-\ntion policy of section 10101 of this title; and \n \n(2) \neither\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe transaction or service is of limited \nscope; or \n \n(B) \nthe application in whole or in part of the \nprovision is not needed to protect shippers from \nthe abuse of market power. \n(b) The Board may, where appropriate, begin a pro-\nceeding under this section on its own initiative or on ap-\nplication by the Secretary of Transportation or an inter-\nested party.  The Board shall, within 90 days after re-\nceipt of any such application, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.  If the Board decides \nnot to begin a class exemption proceeding, the reasons \nfor the decision shall be published in the Federal Regis-\nter.  Any proceeding begun as a result of an application \n\n11a \n \nunder this subsection shall be completed within 9 \nmonths after it is begun. \n(c) The Board may specify the period of time during \nwhich an exemption granted under this section is effec-\ntive. \n(d) The Board may revoke an exemption, to the ex-\ntent it specifies, when it finds that application in whole \nor in part of a provision of this part to the person, class, \nor transportation is necessary to carry out the transpor-\ntation policy of section 10101 of this title.  The Board \nshall, within 90 days after receipt of a request for revo-\ncation under this subsection, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.

The core legal question is the required scope of an agency's environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), specifically whether an agency must analyze environmental effects beyond the proximate impacts of the action over which it has direct regulatory authority. This dispute centers on applying the common-law concept of \"proximate cause\" to NEPA's statutory requirements. The factual context involves the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) approval of an 80-mile railway in Utah, where its environmental review omitted \"downline\" and \"upline\" effects, a decision the D.C. Circuit found to be improperly narrow, leading it to vacate the STB's approval.\n\nMy previous analysis identified a critical information gap: the specific legal arguments and precedents the petitioners would use to support their case for a narrower interpretation of NEPA. I believed the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari was the primary source for this information.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014a failed search for the cert petition\u2014updates my beliefs by confirming that this key piece of evidence is not yet in my possession. While my substantive understanding of the case's legal framework has not changed, my awareness of the current information landscape has sharpened. The information gap I previously identified is now confirmed to be persistent. My ability to predict the Supreme Court's ruling remains contingent on accessing and analyzing the petitioners' specific arguments, and my immediate path to that information has proven unsuccessful. My confidence in any prediction is therefore still low, and the need to locate the petitioners' filing is now more pronounced.",

The case centers on applying the common-law concept of \"proximate cause\" to NEPA's statutory requirements, stemming from the D.C. Circuit's vacatur of the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) approval of a Utah railway due to an environmental review it deemed improperly narrow.\n\nMy previous belief state was defined by a critical information gap\u2014the specific legal arguments the petitioners would deploy. The latest observation has substantially filled this gap and dramatically updated my beliefs. I have now obtained the \"Brief for the Federal Respondents Supporting Petitioners,\" filed by the U.S. Solicitor General.\n\nThis observation reveals several crucial updates:\n\n1.  **Major Party Realignment:** The most significant new fact is that the federal government, represented by the Solicitor General, is supporting the petitioners. The STB, the very agency whose decision was challenged, is a respondent in the case but is arguing for reversal of the D.C. Circuit's decision. This alignment presents a powerful, unified executive branch position advocating for a more constrained interpretation of NEPA's analytical requirements, a signal the Supreme Court often weighs heavily.\n\n2.  **Core Legal Arguments Identified:** The brief provides a clear roadmap of the arguments for reversal, resolving my previous uncertainty. The central thesis is that the STB acted reasonably in limiting its analysis of \"upline\" (oil production) and \"downline\" (oil refining and combustion) effects. The key arguments are:\n    *   **Agency Discretion and Practicality:** NEPA allows agencies to draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" for their analysis. This frames the issue as one of agency deference rather than a rigid statutory command.\n    *   **Reliance on *Public Citizen*:** The brief heavily relies on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, 541 U.S. 752 (2004). The government will argue that, under this precedent, an agency is not required to analyze effects it has no statutory authority to prevent. Since the STB cannot regulate oil drilling or refining, it was not required to conduct a detailed analysis of those activities.\n    *   **Proximate Cause as a Limit:** The brief confirms that proximate cause is a central pillar of the argument. It contends that the effects of future, unplanned oil development are too \"speculative and attenuated\" to be considered proximately caused by the railway's construction.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** The argument incorporates the 2023 amendments to NEPA (Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023), which codified the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard. The government argues that the STB's decision aligns with this standard, as highly speculative third-party actions do not qualify as \"reasonably foreseeable\" effects requiring in-depth analysis.\n\n3.  **Nuanced Position:** The government's support is not a blank check. The brief argues that any limits an agency places on its analysis must still \"comport with NEPA\u2019s text or underlying policies.\" This suggests the government is advocating for a standard of reasonableness and statutory connection, not an unfettered agency power to ignore all indirect effects.\n\nMy confidence in predicting the outcome has shifted significantly. The combination of the Solicitor General's support for the petitioners and a legal strategy grounded in precedent (*Public Citizen*), statutory text (\"reasonably foreseeable\"), and common-law principles (proximate cause) provides a strong basis for reversal. These arguments are likely to be persuasive to a majority of the current Court. The information gap I previously identified has been largely filled, giving me a much clearer view of the legal terrain.",

Retrieving the respondents' merits brief is guaranteed to provide the counterarguments to the powerful 'Public Citizen' precedent, the interpretation of proximate cause, and the effect of the 2023 NEPA amendments. The expected impact on my posterior belief about the case outcome is therefore maximal, justifying a very high Task EIG. The Design EIG is moderate; while reading the respondent's brief is a standard step, observing the specific strategies used to counter a unified industry-government front provides a valuable data point for my general model of argumentation in administrative law cases.

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

          "task_beliefs": "My foundational understanding of this case remains stable: the core legal question is the required scope of an agency's environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), specifically whether an agency must analyze environmental effects beyond the proximate impacts of the action over which it has direct regulatory authority. The case centers on applying the common-law concept of \"proximate cause\" to NEPA's statutory requirements, stemming from the D.C. Circuit's vacatur of the Surface Transportation Board's (STB) approval of a Utah railway due to an environmental review it deemed improperly narrow.\n\nMy belief state was previously updated by the crucial \"Brief for the Federal Respondents Supporting Petitioners,\" which revealed:\n1.  **Major Party Realignment:** The Solicitor General, representing the federal government and the STB, is supporting the petitioners and arguing for reversal. This presents a unified executive branch position advocating for a more constrained interpretation of NEPA.\n2.  **Core Legal Arguments for Reversal:** The petitioners' strategy, as articulated by the Solicitor General, is now clear. It rests on:\n    *   **Agency Discretion:** NEPA affords agencies the flexibility to draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" for their analysis.\n    *   **Precedent:** The argument heavily relies on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), to assert that an agency need not analyze effects it has no statutory authority to prevent (like oil drilling or refining).\n    *   **Proximate Cause:** The concept of proximate cause is used to argue that attenuated, speculative effects from third-party actions are not required subjects of analysis.\n    *   **Statutory Text:** The argument incorporates the 2023 NEPA amendments, which codified the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard, contending the STB's decision aligns with this standard.\n3.  **Nuanced Position:** The government advocates for a standard of reasonableness tied to statutory authority, not an absolute power for agencies to ignore all indirect effects.\n\nThe latest observation is an internal reasoning step, a meta-level reflection on my knowledge-gathering process rather than new external evidence. It does not introduce new facts or arguments about the case. Therefore, my substantive beliefs about the case parameters remain stable.\n\nThis observation serves to reinforce my current understanding of the information landscape. It confirms that my analysis of the Solicitor General's brief has provided a strong, detailed picture of the arguments for reversal. It also explicitly highlights the primary remaining uncertainty: the specific legal counterarguments that will be presented by the respondents, Eagle County, et al. My confidence in predicting the outcome is high based on the petitioners' side, but a complete analysis requires understanding how the respondents will attempt to rebut these arguments and defend the D.C. Circuit's decision. The observation solidifies that my next analytical priority is to obtain and process the respondents' merits brief to fill this critical information gap.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially deepened by the Brief for Respondent Eagle County, which provides the critical counterarguments to the position articulated by the petitioners and the federal government. My belief state now incorporates the full scope of the legal battle.\n\nMy foundational understanding remains: the case concerns the required scope of an agency's environmental review under NEPA. However, the core of the dispute is now clearer. It is a clash between two competing frameworks for defining that scope.\n\n1.  **The Petitioners' Framework (Previously Understood):** This framework, supported by the Solicitor General, seeks to narrow NEPA's scope by importing concepts from tort law.\n    *   **Core Standard:** An agency's analysis should be limited by common-law \"proximate cause\" principles and the agency's direct regulatory authority.\n    *   **Key Precedent:** Heavy reliance on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, arguing an agency need not study effects it lacks the authority to prevent.\n    *   **Application:** This would allow an agency like the STB to ignore \"downline\" effects (like refining impacts) and \"upline\" effects (like oil drilling) because they are regulated by other entities, and to treat other effects as too attenuated to be a \"proximate\" result of the agency's action.\n\n2.  **The Respondents' Framework (New Information):** Eagle County's brief directly counters the petitioners' legal theory and reframes the entire debate.\n    *   **Core Standard:** The proper standard is not \"proximate cause\" but **\"reasonable foreseeability,\"** defined by its **materiality to the agency's decision-making process.** An effect is reasonably foreseeable if \"a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision.\" This standard is rooted in decades of case law, longstanding CEQ regulations, and, crucially, was recently codified by Congress in the bipartisan 2023 NEPA amendments.\n    *   **Rebutting Key Precedents:**\n        *   ***Metropolitan Edison v. People Against Nuclear Energy*** is distinguished as applying only to *non-environmental* harms (like psychological fear), not the classic environmental harms at issue here (wildfires, oil spills, water contamination). The brief notes that *Metropolitan Edison* itself expressly stated it was *not* reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.\n        *   ***Public Citizen*** is distinguished on the grounds that the agency there had no discretion to act on the information in question. Here, the STB has explicit statutory discretion to deny the railway permit if \"the environmental harm...outweighs its transportation benefits.\" Therefore, information about environmental harm is directly material to the STB's decision.\n    *   **Rejecting the \"Pass-the-Buck\" Theory:** The respondents argue that an agency cannot ignore an effect just because another agency has jurisdiction. Instead, NEPA's text and regulations mandate a \"scheme of inter-agency collaboration\" where the lead agency consults with cooperating agencies that have relevant expertise.\n\n3.  **New Procedural and Factual Dimensions:** The respondents' brief introduces two significant new dimensions to the case that could influence the Court's ruling.\n    *   **Potential for Dismissal (DIG):** The respondents argue that the writ of certiorari may have been improvidently granted. They contend that the D.C. Circuit's decision was vacated on multiple, specific grounds related to the STB's \"utterly unreasoned\" analysis of foreseeable downline impacts (wildfire risk, Colorado River impacts). They claim the petitioners did not properly challenge these specific holdings, so even if the Court sides with petitioners on the abstract legal question, the judgment below would stand. This provides the Court with a procedural \"off-ramp\" to avoid deciding the merits.\n    *   **Factual Grounding:** The respondents anchor their arguments in the concrete facts of the case, framing it less as a high-level statutory dispute and more as a standard \"arbitrary and capricious\" review of an agency's failure to take a \"hard look.\" They emphasize that the railway's sole purpose is to transport oil, which will double train traffic along the Colorado River, making risks like spills and wildfires eminently foreseeable and material to the decision to approve the project.\n\nMy belief state has evolved from a one-sided view of the petitioners' strong case to a much more balanced understanding of a competitive legal dispute. The respondents have presented a compelling argument that their \"materiality\" and \"foreseeability\" framework is more faithful to NEPA's text, history, and purpose than the petitioners' attempt to import a \"proximate cause\" standard from tort law. The introduction of the DIG argument also adds a significant new potential outcome. The central uncertainty is no longer what the arguments are, but which of these two competing legal frameworks the Court will adopt and whether it will choose to address the merits at all.",

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

This observation, an act of internal reasoning, does not introduce new external facts but instead synthesizes the existing information from the primary merits briefs and clarifies the central points of contention that will likely determine the outcome.\n\nMy belief state continues to be defined by the clash between two competing legal frameworks for NEPA's scope:\n\n1.  **The Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Framework:** This view, supported by the Solicitor General, argues for a narrow scope of environmental review limited by common-law proximate cause principles and the agency's direct regulatory authority. It relies heavily on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen* to argue an agency need not study effects it cannot directly prevent.\n\n2.  **The Respondents' \"Reasonable Foreseeability\" Framework:** This view posits that the correct standard is \"reasonable foreseeability,\" defined by whether the information is material to the agency's decision-making process. This framework is supported by a different reading of precedent (*Metropolitan Edison*, *Public Citizen*), longstanding agency regulations (CEQ), and, most critically, the recent bipartisan 2023 NEPA amendments which appear to codify this exact standard.\n\nThe latest observation has refined my understanding in the following ways:\n\n*   **Confirmation of Core Conflict:** My synthesis of the primary briefs is now complete. The central legal dispute is precisely the choice between the \"proximate cause\" and \"reasonable foreseeability\" standards. I have a firm grasp on the arguments and key precedents each side uses to support its position.\n*   **Sharpened Focus on a Decisive Issue:** The most critical unresolved question has been identified: **How will the petitioners address the respondents' argument that Congress codified the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard in the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act?** This is a powerful argument for the respondents, as it suggests that the Court need not interpret ambiguous precedent but can instead apply recently enacted statutory text. The petitioners' ability to rebut this point will be a crucial test of their case's strength.\n*   **Strategic Identification of Next Information Source:** My analysis has revealed that the single most informative document to see next is the **petitioners' reply brief**. This brief will contain their direct, focused rebuttal to the respondents' strongest arguments, particularly the argument regarding the 2023 amendments. It will reveal their defensive strategy and potentially expose weaknesses in their position.\n*   **Procedural Posture Remains Relevant:** The possibility of a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG), raised by the respondents, remains a viable \"off-ramp\" for the Court if it wishes to avoid a merits ruling. The petitioners' reply brief may also need to address why the Court should reach the broad legal question they present, even if the D.C. Circuit's judgment could be affirmed on narrower, fact-specific grounds.\n\nIn essence, my belief state has evolved from information acquisition to strategic analysis. I am no longer just cataloging arguments but am now actively modeling the legal exchange and identifying the pivotal points of leverage. The central uncertainty is no longer *what* the arguments are, but *how* the petitioners will counter the respondents' potent statutory argument and whether the Court will find that counter-argument persuasive.",

While I was previously anticipating the petitioners' reply, the SG's brief is a more powerful signal, as it often charts a middle course the Court finds persuasive. My belief state, which had previously consolidated the opposing views of the petitioners and respondents, now incorporates a third, highly influential framework that fundamentally alters the likely outcome.\n\nMy belief state, which previously centered on a binary conflict, is now a three-way dynamic:\n\n1.  **The Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Framework:** This view argues for a narrow scope of review limited by common-law proximate cause and the agency's direct regulatory authority, relying on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*. This position remains, but its viability as the majority rule has been weakened.\n\n2.  **The Respondents' \"Reasonable Foreseeability\" Framework:** This view posits that \"reasonable foreseeability\" is the sole and sufficient test for the scope of NEPA analysis, supported by CEQ regulations and, crucially, the 2023 NEPA amendments. This position has been significantly undermined by the SG's arguments.\n\n3.  **The Solicitor General's \"Context-Specific Rule of Reason\" Framework (New and Dominant):** This is the major new development. The SG explicitly rejects both of the parties' \"all-or-nothing\" approaches.\n    *   It argues the respondents are wrong that \"reasonable foreseeability is the only limit,\" citing *Metropolitan Edison*'s requirement for a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" that goes beyond mere but-for causation.\n    *   It also argues the petitioners \"go too far\" in seeking to import rigid, bright-line rules like tort-law proximate cause, which the Court has previously cautioned against.\n    *   Instead, the SG advocates for a deferential, case-by-case standard where agencies can draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" based on the \"rule of reason.\" This empowers agencies to decide when an effect is too attenuated, speculative, or immaterial to be useful for its decision-making process, a determination that courts should only overturn if \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThis new observation has resolved the key uncertainty I had previously identified and clarified the legal battleground:\n\n*   **The 2023 Amendments Argument is Neutralized:** My most pressing question was how the petitioners would counter the argument that Congress codified the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard in 2023. The SG has provided a powerful rebuttal. It argues that since the amendments were intended to *streamline* NEPA review (e.g., by adding page and time limits), it would be \"passing strange\" to interpret them as *broadening* the scope of required analysis. The SG contends the amendments simply codified one existing limit (foreseeability) while leaving in place the Court's other established limit from *Metropolitan Edison* (a \"reasonably close causal relationship\"). This effectively defangs the respondents' strongest statutory argument.\n\n*   **A Clear \"Off-Ramp\" for the Court:** The SG's brief provides the Court with a perfect vehicle to reverse the D.C. Circuit without adopting the petitioners' more extreme position. The Court can rule for the government by simply reaffirming its own precedents (*Public Citizen*, *Metropolitan Edison*, *Kleppe*) and holding that the lower court failed to apply the deferential \"rule of reason\" to the agency's expert judgment. This avoids making a broad new rule for all NEPA cases and instead reinforces traditional principles of administrative deference.\n\n*   **Increased Confidence in Reversal:** My confidence that the Supreme Court will reverse the D.C. Circuit's decision has significantly increased. The SG's moderate, agency-deferential position is historically very persuasive to the Court. It allows for a narrow ruling that finds the STB's decision to limit its analysis was a reasonable, context-specific judgment call, not a legal error. The central question is no longer *which* of two competing tests the Court will choose, but whether the Court will adopt the SG's middle-ground framework that emphasizes agency discretion.",

My understanding of the case's legal landscape and likely outcome is unchanged.\n\nMy current belief state continues to be defined by the three-way dynamic established by the parties and the government:\n\n1.  **The Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Framework:** This position, rooted in *Department of Transp. v.

The SG's brief carves a middle path, rejecting the \"all-or-nothing\" approaches of both parties. It argues that while foreseeability is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient; NEPA analysis must also be guided by a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" as established in *Metropolitan Edison*. Crucially, the SG advocates for a deferential standard where agencies have the discretion to draw \"manageable, context-specific lines\" based on a \"rule of reason,\" and courts should only overturn these lines if they are \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\n\nThe SG's brief continues to be the dispositive piece of evidence in my analysis, having resolved my previous key uncertainties:\n\n*   **Neutralization of the 2023 NEPA Amendments:** The SG's argument that it would be \"passing strange\" to interpret streamlining amendments as a mandate for *broader* environmental analysis remains a powerful counter to the respondents' statutory claims. The SG's reading\u2014that the amendments codified the foreseeability limit while leaving the *Metropolitan Edison* \"close causal relationship\" limit intact\u2014effectively defuses the respondents' strongest argument.\n\n*   **The Administrative Deference \"Off-Ramp\":** The SG's framework provides the Court a clear and compelling path to reverse the D.C. Circuit without adopting the petitioners' more rigid proximate cause test. The Court can issue a narrow ruling that reaffirms its own precedents on administrative deference (*Public Citizen*, *Metropolitan Edison*, *Kleppe*) and finds that the STB's decision to limit its analysis was a reasonable exercise of its expert judgment under the \"rule of reason.\"\n\nBecause this observation yielded no new information, my confidence level remains unchanged. I am still highly confident that the Supreme Court will reverse the D.C. Circuit. The central question is not *if* the Court will reverse, but *how* it will do so, and the SG's moderate, agency-deferential position offers the most probable path. The failed search for amicus briefs means I still lack insight into the breadth of support for the petitioners' position, but this does not alter my core prediction, which is now heavily weighted by the government's persuasive intervention.",

While it's unlikely to completely flip my prediction from 'reverse' to 'affirm', the amicus briefs could significantly alter my confidence and understanding of the case's dynamics. Discovering a broad coalition of states or powerful new legal arguments supporting the respondents could weaken the perceived inevitability of the SG's position and increase the probability of a narrow majority or even an affirmance. Conversely, finding only redundant or weak arguments would strongly confirm my current hypothesis, increasing my confidence in a reversal. The action will, at a minimum, refine my understanding of the potential scope of the majority opinion and the arguments likely to appear in a dissent.\n\nDesign EIG (0.5): This action provides a valuable data point for a recurring strategic question: how much weight should be given to amicus briefs relative to a dispositive-seeming brief from the Solicitor General in an administrative law case? Observing the content of these briefs and, eventually, how they are (or are not) reflected in the Court's final opinion will help calibrate my model's weighting of different information sources. This is a generalizable insight applicable to many future cases.\n\nOverall, this is a well-justified, high-value action that systematically fills a gap in the analysis, promising to improve both the specific prediction and the general predictive model.",

Rep. to the Governor \n(2021) ....................................................................... 4 \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \nInterest of Amicus Curiae \nAmicus Curiae is the State of Utah. The State \nhas significant interest in economic development op-\nportunities for its more rural counties. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project (Railway or Project) offers just \nsuch an opportunity. Utah state and federal officials \nstrongly support this Project for a variety of reasons, \nfrom economic to environmental to safety.  \nPetitioners give the legal reasons why the \nCourt should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision. The \nState agrees. But in Utah, this case affects far more \nthan clarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. \nThe Railway will help thousands of Utah residents, \nvarious local governments, and the State itself. So \nUtah submits this amicus brief to highlight how im-\nportant the Railway is to, and the positive impacts it \nwould have on, the affected counties, the State, and its \nresidents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See CA JA1304-05. That\u2019s \nbecause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nBasin are two-lane roads that present freight trans-\nportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-County \nInfrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has champi-\noned the Railway: an over 80-mile rail line that would \nconnect the Basin with the national rail network and \nunlock the region\u2019s economic potential. See, e.g., \nJA106. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state and federal level \nhave voiced their support for the Project. See, e.g., CA \nJA245, CA JA540-41, CA JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \n\n2 \napproval of the Railway. The STB had considered the \nProject\u2019s transportation merits, conducted a thorough \nand reasoned review under the National Environmen-\ntal Policy Act of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects falling within the STB\u2019s pur-\nview per Department of Transportation v. Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public \ncomments, \nand \nimposed \nextensive \nmitigation \nmeasures to reduce the Project\u2019s environmental im-\npact. See generally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at \n108a (discussing Public Citizen). The STB found that \nthe Project advanced important transportation bene-\nfits that outweighed mitigated environmental im-\npacts. Pet. App. 122a. The STB therefore exercised its \ndiscretion under the Interstate Commerce Commis-\nsion Termination Act\u2014which promotes railway devel-\nopment for the public good\u2014and approved the Project. \nId.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 (stating federal policy in reg-\nulating railroad industry).   \nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit took a different \nview of NEPA\u2019s scope. The circuit court determined, in \npart, that the STB\u2019s analysis was inadequate because \nit did not weigh speculative environmental impacts \nthe Railway might cause upstream or downline in \nother parts of the country and over which the STB had \nno regulatory authority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, \n66a-68a, 70a. The court said the STB\u2019s position \u201cthat \nit need not consider [environmental] effects it cannot \nprevent is simply inapplicable\u201d because the STB can \nweigh whether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental \nand other costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at \n37a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s take on NEPA\u2019s require-\nments is wrong. Pet. Br. at 19-49; Fed. Resp. Br. at 39-\n45. This Court should reverse. But even beyond the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the \n\n3 \nmany benefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uin-\ntah Basin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to \nexplain why this Project matters to the State and its \nresidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Railway \nfrom the beginning because it will promote the devel-\nopment of local and statewide economies and improve \nthe lives of Utahns. See, e.g., CA JA245. The Railway \nwill provide critical infrastructure facilitating the flow \nof commodities to and from the Uintah Basin. It has \nthe potential to open the region to entirely new mar-\nkets that rely on freight shipping and to create jobs. \nAnd it will do so while protecting the environment and \nUtah\u2019s transportation workers. Blocking the Project \nstifles economic, environmental, and safety improve-\nments in the region and hurts area residents. The \nState of Utah urges this Court to view the Railway as \na vital investment in critical infrastructure that will \nbenefit the Uintah Basin, the State of Utah, its resi-\ndents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like the Uinta Basin \nRailway realize the policies that promote the im-\nportance and development of the rural American econ-\nomy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe STB concluded that the Project would pro-\nvide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe STB must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the STB was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).1  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)2; see \nalso CA JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in \nthe region, significant investment will be needed, in-\ncluding investments in strategic infrastructure. As \nthe STB recognized, the Railway has the potential to \nadvance many rail policy objectives by addressing \n \n1https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nthese problems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway \nlikely \u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job \ncreation by allowing energy, agricultural, mining \nproducts, and manufactured goods, to reach global \nmarkets more easily.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely \non shipping by freight will be able to open locations in \nthe previously inaccessible region, which has the po-\ntential to open new markets and create jobs. See 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide substan-\ntial economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which also supported \nthe project. JA546-47 (Ute Tribe noting that \u201c[o]il and \ngas production on the reservation is the most signifi-\ncant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d and \nurging the STB to \u201cmove swiftly with final approval \nand issuance of license\u201d). This Railway promises to \nbring tremendous economic opportunities to the peo-\nple of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties. All \nthree counties have been vocal proponents of the Rail-\nway. CA JA582 (\u201cCarbon County believes that the \nUinta Basin Railway project will fill a gap in major \ninfrastructure that will help develop and diversify the \nregional economy.\u201d); CA JA579 (\u201cThe Duchesne \nCounty Commission believes that the Uinta Basin \nRailway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); CA JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The STB\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. The D.C. Circuit did not. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nCA JA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends \non trucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nCA JA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, \nthis Railway offers to break that dependence, which \nhas \u201champered the economic vitality of the area and \npresents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely on \nrail access will be able, for the first time, to consider \nlocations in the Uintah Basin. CA JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would significantly decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the Uintah Basin\u2019s in-\ndustry. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., The Positive Env\u2019t Effects of \nIncreased Freight by Rail Movements in America at 3 \n(June 2020) (\u201cIf 25% of the truck traffic moving at \n\n7 \nleast 750 miles went by rail instead, annual fuel sav-\nings would be some 1.2 billion gallons and annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions would fall by approximately \n13.1 million tons,\u201d and \u201c[i]f 50% of the truck traffic \nmoving at least 750 miles went by rail instead, annual \nfuel savings would be approximately 2.3 billion gal-\nlons and greenhouse gas emissions would fall by ap-\nproximately 26.2 million tons.\u201d).3 Freight rail\u2019s fuel ef-\nficiency in the United States has been increasing for \nnearly four decades straight.

Id.  \n \nIII. \nFederal overregulation ignores States\u2019 in-\nterests and stunts development. \nThe STB recognized a fundamental point that \nthe D.C. Circuit did not. \u201cOil and gas development \n[was] not part of\u201d the proposed agency action\u2014railway \napproval\u2014before the STB and would be \u201csubject to the \napproval processes of other federal, state, local, and \ntribal agencies.\u201d JA 522. By pushing NEPA review \nwell past its legal and logical limits, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \ndecision seemingly presumes that only the federal \ngovernment and its myriad agencies care about the \nenvironment. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAnd this paternalistic view ignores Utah\u2019s sovereign \ninterests and needlessly stymies development.  \nFirst, Utah\u2019s interest in economic development \nin no way negates the State\u2019s ongoing environmental \ninterests. Utah\u2019s leaders and residents have a vested \ninterest in a healthy environment: they live here, \nwork here, recreate here, raise families here, and in-\nvite the world to come share the State\u2019s world-class \nscenery, skiing, hiking, fishing, rock-climbing, moun-\ntain-biking, and state and national parks, among \nmany other outdoor activities. No one\u2014including fed-\neral bureaucrats located far away in Washington, \n \n5https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AAR-Rail-\nroad-Workplace-Safety-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n9 \nD.C.\u2014has more interest in Utah\u2019 environment than \nUtahns.  \nThat\u2019s why Utah regulates oil and gas activity \nin the State, including: drilling; well completion, oper-\nation, and maintenance; construction; recovery tech-\nniques; and remediation activities. Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 40-\n6-2.5(1), -5(3)(a). To that end, the Utah Board of Oil, \nGas, and Mining has promulgated comprehensive reg-\nulations governing well locations, well permitting, \npre-drill evaluations, drilling operations, well control, \nwell testing and inspections, fire hazards, and pollu-\ntion and surface damage control. See, e.g., Utah Ad-\nmin. Code R649-3-1 to -19. Operators must reasonably \nguard against\u2014including taking specified minimum \nsteps to prevent\u2014polluting lands, streams, reservoirs, \nnatural drainage ways, and underground water ways. \nId. R649-3-15(1). They must also maintain the prop-\nerty with \u201cdue regard\u201d for its preservation and conser-\nvation and for \u201cthe health and safety of employees and \npeople residing in close proximity.\u201d Id. R649-3-15(1.1). \nAnd the wells remain subject to inspection to ensure \ncompliance with the regulations. Id. R649-3-17; see \nalso Utah Code \u00a7 40-6-16(1).    \nBeyond the oil and gas laws and rules, oil and \ngas operations are subject to Utah\u2019s Air Conservation \nAct, Utah Code \u00a7 19-2-101 to -304, which is meant to \nachieve and maintain air quality levels that \u201cprotect \nhuman health and safety\u201d and \u201cprevent injury to plant \nand animal life and property,\u201d id. \u00a7 19-2-101(2). Under \nthe Act\u2019s authority, the Utah Air Quality Board has \nenacted comprehensive regulations governing oil and \nnatural gas exploration, production, and transmis-\nsion, and well production facilities. Utah Admin. Code \nR307-501-3; see also id. R307-501 to R307-511 (regu-\nlations governing pneumatic controllers, flares, tank \ntruck loading, registration requirements, storage \n\n10 \nvessels, dehydrators, VOC control devices, leak detec-\ntion and repair, natural gas engine requirements, and \nassociated gas flares).  \nSimilarly, oil and gas operators (like any other \nUtah industry) must abide by Utah\u2019s Water Quality \nAct, which prohibits (1) discharging pollutants into \nstate waters; (2) causing pollution \u201cwhich constitutes \na menace to public health and welfare, or is harmful \nto wildlife, fish, or aquatic life, or impairs domestic, \nagricultural, industrial, recreational, or other benefi-\ncial uses of water\u201d; or (3) placing \u201cwaste in a location \nwhere there is probable cause to believe it will cause \npollution.\u201d Utah Code \u00a7 19-5-107(1)(a). \nGiven Utah\u2019s (and other States\u2019) own environ-\nmental regulations, based on their own sovereign in-\nterests and knowledge of their own State\u2019s needs and \ncircumstances, there\u2019s simply no justification for the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s overextension of NEPA review. The STB \nalready produced an exhaustive 3,600-page environ-\nmental impact statement under NEPA\u2014all for a rela-\ntively short 80-plus mile proposed railway in a rural \nand remote part of Utah. Pet. Br. at 11. That more \nthan satisfies NEPA\u2019s goal to ensure agencies make \nenvironmentally informed decisions. Id. at 4. Requir-\ning even more analysis of speculative impacts in other \nparts of the country ignores and intrudes on each \nState\u2019s sovereign interests in their own environmental \nregulations.  \nSecond, federal overregulation delays, if not \nkills, much-needed development. A recent news arti-\ncle highlighted just a few of the problems various \ntypes of projects face in dealing with federal regula-\ntors. Amy Joi O\u2019Donoghue, What\u2019s up with delays on \nprojects on federal lands? Deseret.com (May 27, \n\n11 \n2024).6 Everyone recognizes the benefits from and \nneed for diverse energy sources. But \u201c[d]espite being a \ncarbon free and abundant source of energy in Utah, \ntapping geothermal resources working through the \nBureau of Land Management is likened by some in the \nindustry as a nagging, painful canker sore that pre-\nsents no cure.\u201d Id. One company nominated BLM con-\ntrolled land for geothermal exploration in 2008 and \ncompleted an environmental assessment more than \nseven years ago, but still can\u2019t move forward. Id. \nOther companies nominated BLM land for geothermal \nexploration, spent years on technical due diligence, in-\ncluding time and capital, and had planned on more \ncapital expenditures, only to have BLM abruptly an-\nnounce that it was deferring leasing the land until late \n2025. Id. The federal delays and inconsistencies in \nUtah push geothermal developers to other states. Id.  \nOil and gas producers are also finding it diffi-\ncult to lease land from federal regulators. One indus-\ntry representative explained that \u201cYou can be held up \nfor years waiting for a lease to come up and then let\u2019s \nsay if it does, if it is litigated\u2014which almost all of \nthem have been since 2016\u2014then you can have the \nBLM saying well, we\u2019re uncertain what this litigation \nis going to look like so we\u2019re just going to hold up your \napplication to drill permit.\u201d Id.    \nThe TransWest Express high-voltage transmis-\nsion line, crossing parts of four states including Utah, \nlikewise faced inexplicable delay. It took nine years to \nget right-of-way approvals, then another five years to \ncomplete right-of-way requirements to move forward \nwith construction. Id.    \n \n6https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/05/27/whats-up-with-\ndelays-on-projects-on-federal-lands/. \n\n12 \nAnd it remains uncertain whether a long \nplanned four-mile, four-lane highway will be built in \nsouthern Utah. Federal agencies granted approval to \nproceed in 2021. But conservation groups sued over \nthe project and, as part of a settlement in that suit, \nthe federal agencies announced they would revisit the \nhighway\u2019s approval and conduct a new review. Id. All \nthis has left state and federal leaders wondering what \ntransportation needs can be realistically satisfied un-\nder current federal regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine \nwe [can] do the things that we need to do to support \nour economy, our society,\u201d the director of Utah\u2019s De-\npartment of Transportation said. \u201cToday, it seems like \nit\u2019s much harder to do things that matter.\u201d Id. \nFederal regulations don\u2019t need to be applied \nthis way. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s overbroad application of \nNEPA only exacerbates the federal overregulation \nproblem.   \n \nConclusion \nThe Court should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \njudgment below.  \n \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n /s/ Stanford E. Purser  \n \nStanford E.

The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project from which this case arises offers \njust such an opportunity. Utah state and federal offi-\ncials, as noted herein, have stated their strong support \nin seeing this railway project come to fruition for a va-\nriety of reasons, from economic to environmental to \nsafety.  \nPetitioners have shown the legal reasons\u2014in-\ncluding a circuit split over the meaning of this Court\u2019s \nprecedent\u2014why the Court should grant review in this \ncase. The State agrees. But in Utah, the petition for \nwrit of certiorari and this case affects far more than \nclarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. The \nUinta Basin Railway project (Railway or Project) will \nhelp thousands of Utah residents, various local gov-\nernments, and the State itself. So Utah submits this \namicus brief to highlight how important the Railway \nis to, and the positive impacts it would have on, the \nrelevant counties, the State, and its residents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See JA1304-05. That\u2019s be-\ncause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nUintah Basin are two-lane roads that present freight \ntransportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-\nCounty Infrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has \n \n1The parties\u2019 counsel of record received timely notice of \nUtah\u2019s intent to file this brief under Supreme Court Rule 37.2. \n\n2 \nchampioned the Uinta Basin Railway: an over 80-mile \nrail line that would connect the Basin with the na-\ntional rail network and unlock the region\u2019s economic \npotential. See, e.g., JA798. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state \nand federal level have voiced their support for the Pro-\nject. See, e.g., JA245, JA540-41, JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \napproval of the Railway. The Board\u2019s final approval \ncame after it had considered the Project\u2019s transporta-\ntion merits, conducted a thorough and reasoned re-\nview of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects falling within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction \nper Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public com-\nments, and imposed extensive mitigation measures to \nreduce the Project\u2019s environmental impact. See gener-\nally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at 108a (discuss-\ning Public Citizen). The Board found that the Project \nadvanced important transportation benefits that out-\nweighed mitigated environmental impacts. Pet. App. \n122a. So the Board exercised its discretion under the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act\u2014\nwhich promotes railway development for the public \ngood\u2014and approved the Project. Id.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10101 (stating federal policy in regulating railroad in-\ndustry).   \nAdhering to a different view of Public Citizen, \nthe panel below determined, in part, that the Board\u2019s \nanalysis was inadequate because it did not weigh \nspeculative environmental impacts the Railway might \ncause upstream or downline in other parts of the coun-\ntry and over which the Board had no regulatory au-\nthority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, 66a-68a, 70a. In \nthe panel\u2019s words, the Board\u2019s position \u201cthat it need \nnot consider [environmental] effects it cannot prevent \n\n3 \nis simply inapplicable\u201d because the Board can weigh \nwhether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental and \nother costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at 37a.  \nThe panel\u2019s take on Public Citizen\u2019s meaning is \nwrong and conflicts with several other circuit courts. \nPet. at 14-23. The Court should grant certiorari re-\nview for that reason alone. But even beyond the \npanel\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the many \nbenefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uintah \nBasin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to ex-\nplain why this Project matters to the State and its res-\nidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Uinta \nBasin Railway from the beginning because the Project \nwill promote the development of local and statewide \neconomies and improve the lives of Utahns. See, e.g., \nJA245. The Railway will be critical infrastructure fa-\ncilitating the flow of commodities to and from the Uin-\ntah Basin. It has the potential to open the region to \nentirely new markets that rely on freight shipping and \nto create jobs. And it will do so while protecting the \nenvironment and Utah\u2019s transportation workers. \nBlocking the Project stifles economic, environmental, \nand safety improvements in the region and hurts area \nresidents. The State of Utah urges this Court to view \nthe Railway as a vital investment in critical infra-\nstructure that will benefit the Uintah Basin, the State \nof Utah, its residents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like \nthe Uinta Basin Railway realize the policies that pro-\nmote the importance and development of the rural \nAmerican economy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe Board concluded that the Project would \nprovide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe Board must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the Board was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).2  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)3; see \nalso JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in the \nregion, significant investment will be needed, includ-\ning investments in strategic infrastructure. As the \nBoard recognized, the Railway has the potential to ad-\nvance many rail policy objectives by addressing these \n \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n3https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nproblems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway likely \n\u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job creation \nby allowing energy, agricultural, mining products, \nand manufactured goods, to reach global markets \nmore easily.\u201d JA796. Businesses that rely on shipping \nby freight will be able to open locations in the previ-\nously inaccessible region, which has the potential to \nopen new markets and create jobs. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide signifi-\ncant economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which similarly sup-\nported the project. JA1315-16 (Ute Tribe noting that \n\u201c[o]il and gas production on the reservation is the most \nsignificant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d \nand urging the Board to \u201cmove swiftly with final ap-\nproval and issuance of license\u201d). This Railway prom-\nises to bring tremendous economic opportunities to \nthe people of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties.  \nUnsurprisingly, all three counties have been vocal ad-\nvocates for the Railway. JA582 (\u201cCarbon County be-\nlieves that the Uinta Basin Railway project will fill a \ngap in major infrastructure that will help develop and \ndiversify the regional economy.\u201d); JA579 (\u201cThe Duch-\nesne County Commission believes that the Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The Board\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nJA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends on \ntrucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nJA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, this \nRailway offers to break that dependence, which has \n\u201champered the economic vitality of the area and pre-\nsents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d JA796. Businesses that rely on rail \naccess will be able, for the first time, to consider loca-\ntions in the Uintah Basin. JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would have a significant im-\npact in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from the \nUintah Basin\u2019s industry. Ass\u2019n of Am.

The State \nhas significant interest in economic development op-\nportunities for its more rural counties. The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project (Railway or Project) offers just \nsuch an opportunity. Utah state and federal officials \nstrongly support this Project for a variety of reasons, \nfrom economic to environmental to safety.  \nPetitioners give the legal reasons why the \nCourt should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision. The \nState agrees. But in Utah, this case affects far more \nthan clarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. \nThe Railway will help thousands of Utah residents, \nvarious local governments, and the State itself. So \nUtah submits this amicus brief to highlight how im-\nportant the Railway is to, and the positive impacts it \nwould have on, the affected counties, the State, and its \nresidents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See CA JA1304-05. That\u2019s \nbecause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nBasin are two-lane roads that present freight trans-\nportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-County \nInfrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has champi-\noned the Railway: an over 80-mile rail line that would \nconnect the Basin with the national rail network and \nunlock the region\u2019s economic potential. See, e.g., \nJA106. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state and federal level \nhave voiced their support for the Project. See, e.g., CA \nJA245, CA JA540-41, CA JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \n\n2 \napproval of the Railway. The STB had considered the \nProject\u2019s transportation merits, conducted a thorough \nand reasoned review under the National Environmen-\ntal Policy Act of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects falling within the STB\u2019s pur-\nview per Department of Transportation v. Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public \ncomments, \nand \nimposed \nextensive \nmitigation \nmeasures to reduce the Project\u2019s environmental im-\npact. See generally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at \n108a (discussing Public Citizen). The STB found that \nthe Project advanced important transportation bene-\nfits that outweighed mitigated environmental im-\npacts. Pet. App. 122a. The STB therefore exercised its \ndiscretion under the Interstate Commerce Commis-\nsion Termination Act\u2014which promotes railway devel-\nopment for the public good\u2014and approved the Project. \nId.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 (stating federal policy in reg-\nulating railroad industry).   \nOn appeal, the D.C. Circuit took a different \nview of NEPA\u2019s scope. The circuit court determined, in \npart, that the STB\u2019s analysis was inadequate because \nit did not weigh speculative environmental impacts \nthe Railway might cause upstream or downline in \nother parts of the country and over which the STB had \nno regulatory authority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, \n66a-68a, 70a. The court said the STB\u2019s position \u201cthat \nit need not consider [environmental] effects it cannot \nprevent is simply inapplicable\u201d because the STB can \nweigh whether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental \nand other costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at \n37a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s take on NEPA\u2019s require-\nments is wrong. Pet. Br. at 19-49; Fed. Resp. Br. at 39-\n45. This Court should reverse. But even beyond the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the \n\n3 \nmany benefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uin-\ntah Basin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to \nexplain why this Project matters to the State and its \nresidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Railway \nfrom the beginning because it will promote the devel-\nopment of local and statewide economies and improve \nthe lives of Utahns. See, e.g., CA JA245. The Railway \nwill provide critical infrastructure facilitating the flow \nof commodities to and from the Uintah Basin. It has \nthe potential to open the region to entirely new mar-\nkets that rely on freight shipping and to create jobs. \nAnd it will do so while protecting the environment and \nUtah\u2019s transportation workers. Blocking the Project \nstifles economic, environmental, and safety improve-\nments in the region and hurts area residents. The \nState of Utah urges this Court to view the Railway as \na vital investment in critical infrastructure that will \nbenefit the Uintah Basin, the State of Utah, its resi-\ndents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like the Uinta Basin \nRailway realize the policies that promote the im-\nportance and development of the rural American econ-\nomy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe STB concluded that the Project would pro-\nvide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe STB must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the STB was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).1  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)2; see \nalso CA JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in \nthe region, significant investment will be needed, in-\ncluding investments in strategic infrastructure. As \nthe STB recognized, the Railway has the potential to \nadvance many rail policy objectives by addressing \n \n1https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nthese problems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway \nlikely \u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job \ncreation by allowing energy, agricultural, mining \nproducts, and manufactured goods, to reach global \nmarkets more easily.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely \non shipping by freight will be able to open locations in \nthe previously inaccessible region, which has the po-\ntential to open new markets and create jobs. See 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide substan-\ntial economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which also supported \nthe project. JA546-47 (Ute Tribe noting that \u201c[o]il and \ngas production on the reservation is the most signifi-\ncant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d and \nurging the STB to \u201cmove swiftly with final approval \nand issuance of license\u201d). This Railway promises to \nbring tremendous economic opportunities to the peo-\nple of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties. All \nthree counties have been vocal proponents of the Rail-\nway. CA JA582 (\u201cCarbon County believes that the \nUinta Basin Railway project will fill a gap in major \ninfrastructure that will help develop and diversify the \nregional economy.\u201d); CA JA579 (\u201cThe Duchesne \nCounty Commission believes that the Uinta Basin \nRailway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); CA JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The STB\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. The D.C. Circuit did not. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nCA JA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends \non trucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nCA JA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, \nthis Railway offers to break that dependence, which \nhas \u201champered the economic vitality of the area and \npresents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d CA JA796. Businesses that rely on \nrail access will be able, for the first time, to consider \nlocations in the Uintah Basin. CA JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would significantly decrease \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the Uintah Basin\u2019s in-\ndustry. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., The Positive Env\u2019t Effects of \nIncreased Freight by Rail Movements in America at 3 \n(June 2020) (\u201cIf 25% of the truck traffic moving at \n\n7 \nleast 750 miles went by rail instead, annual fuel sav-\nings would be some 1.2 billion gallons and annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions would fall by approximately \n13.1 million tons,\u201d and \u201c[i]f 50% of the truck traffic \nmoving at least 750 miles went by rail instead, annual \nfuel savings would be approximately 2.3 billion gal-\nlons and greenhouse gas emissions would fall by ap-\nproximately 26.2 million tons.\u201d).3 Freight rail\u2019s fuel ef-\nficiency in the United States has been increasing for \nnearly four decades straight. Id. at 4 (\u201cU.S. freight rail \nvolume is higher than it used to be, but railroad fuel \nconsumption is much lower. In 2019 alone, U.S. \nfreight railroads consumed 656 million fewer gallons \nof fuel and emitted 7.3 million fewer tons of carbon di-\noxide than they would have if their fuel efficiency had \nremained constant since 2000.\u201d). Today, rail is the \nmost fuel-efficient way to move freight over land. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail & Climate Change (up-\ndated Feb. 2024).4 As a result, \u201cmoving freight by rail \ninstead of truck lowers greenhouse gas emissions by \nup to 75%, on average[.]\u201d Positive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, \nat 1.  \nShipping freight by rail instead of by truck is \nnot only better for the environment, it\u2019s safer for in-\ndustry employees and Utah drivers. Because a single \ntrain carries the freight of hundreds of trucks, moving \nfreight by rail instead of by truck takes trucks off the \nroads, easing congestion for individual drivers. Posi-\ntive Env\u2019t Effects, supra, at 3. Railways are also safer \n \n3https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AAR-Posi-\ntive-Environmental-Effects-of-Freight-Rail-White-Paper-\n62020.pdf. \n4https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AAR-\nFreight-Rail-Climate-Change-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n8 \nfor employees\u2014the employee injury rate in trucking \nand many other industries is higher than that in rail. \nAss\u2019n of Am. R.R., Freight Rail Emp. Safety at 1 (up-\ndated Mar. 2024).5 And the employee injury rate in \nrail has been trending downward to an all-time low in \n2023. Id.  \n \nIII. \nFederal overregulation ignores States\u2019 in-\nterests and stunts development. \nThe STB recognized a fundamental point that \nthe D.C. Circuit did not. \u201cOil and gas development \n[was] not part of\u201d the proposed agency action\u2014railway \napproval\u2014before the STB and would be \u201csubject to the \napproval processes of other federal, state, local, and \ntribal agencies.\u201d JA 522. By pushing NEPA review \nwell past its legal and logical limits, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \ndecision seemingly presumes that only the federal \ngovernment and its myriad agencies care about the \nenvironment. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nAnd this paternalistic view ignores Utah\u2019s sovereign \ninterests and needlessly stymies development.  \nFirst, Utah\u2019s interest in economic development \nin no way negates the State\u2019s ongoing environmental \ninterests. Utah\u2019s leaders and residents have a vested \ninterest in a healthy environment: they live here, \nwork here, recreate here, raise families here, and in-\nvite the world to come share the State\u2019s world-class \nscenery, skiing, hiking, fishing, rock-climbing, moun-\ntain-biking, and state and national parks, among \nmany other outdoor activities. No one\u2014including fed-\neral bureaucrats located far away in Washington, \n \n5https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AAR-Rail-\nroad-Workplace-Safety-Fact-Sheet.pdf. \n\n9 \nD.C.\u2014has more interest in Utah\u2019 environment than \nUtahns.  \nThat\u2019s why Utah regulates oil and gas activity \nin the State, including: drilling; well completion, oper-\nation, and maintenance; construction; recovery tech-\nniques; and remediation activities. Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 40-\n6-2.5(1), -5(3)(a). To that end, the Utah Board of Oil, \nGas, and Mining has promulgated comprehensive reg-\nulations governing well locations, well permitting, \npre-drill evaluations, drilling operations, well control, \nwell testing and inspections, fire hazards, and pollu-\ntion and surface damage control. See, e.g., Utah Ad-\nmin. Code R649-3-1 to -19. Operators must reasonably \nguard against\u2014including taking specified minimum \nsteps to prevent\u2014polluting lands, streams, reservoirs, \nnatural drainage ways, and underground water ways. \nId. R649-3-15(1). They must also maintain the prop-\nerty with \u201cdue regard\u201d for its preservation and conser-\nvation and for \u201cthe health and safety of employees and \npeople residing in close proximity.\u201d Id. R649-3-15(1.1). \nAnd the wells remain subject to inspection to ensure \ncompliance with the regulations. Id. R649-3-17; see \nalso Utah Code \u00a7 40-6-16(1).    \nBeyond the oil and gas laws and rules, oil and \ngas operations are subject to Utah\u2019s Air Conservation \nAct, Utah Code \u00a7 19-2-101 to -304, which is meant to \nachieve and maintain air quality levels that \u201cprotect \nhuman health and safety\u201d and \u201cprevent injury to plant \nand animal life and property,\u201d id. \u00a7 19-2-101(2). Under \nthe Act\u2019s authority, the Utah Air Quality Board has \nenacted comprehensive regulations governing oil and \nnatural gas exploration, production, and transmis-\nsion, and well production facilities. Utah Admin. Code \nR307-501-3; see also id. R307-501 to R307-511 (regu-\nlations governing pneumatic controllers, flares, tank \ntruck loading, registration requirements, storage \n\n10 \nvessels, dehydrators, VOC control devices, leak detec-\ntion and repair, natural gas engine requirements, and \nassociated gas flares).  \nSimilarly, oil and gas operators (like any other \nUtah industry) must abide by Utah\u2019s Water Quality \nAct, which prohibits (1) discharging pollutants into \nstate waters; (2) causing pollution \u201cwhich constitutes \na menace to public health and welfare, or is harmful \nto wildlife, fish, or aquatic life, or impairs domestic, \nagricultural, industrial, recreational, or other benefi-\ncial uses of water\u201d; or (3) placing \u201cwaste in a location \nwhere there is probable cause to believe it will cause \npollution.\u201d Utah Code \u00a7 19-5-107(1)(a). \nGiven Utah\u2019s (and other States\u2019) own environ-\nmental regulations, based on their own sovereign in-\nterests and knowledge of their own State\u2019s needs and \ncircumstances, there\u2019s simply no justification for the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s overextension of NEPA review. The STB \nalready produced an exhaustive 3,600-page environ-\nmental impact statement under NEPA\u2014all for a rela-\ntively short 80-plus mile proposed railway in a rural \nand remote part of Utah. Pet. Br. at 11. That more \nthan satisfies NEPA\u2019s goal to ensure agencies make \nenvironmentally informed decisions. Id. at 4. Requir-\ning even more analysis of speculative impacts in other \nparts of the country ignores and intrudes on each \nState\u2019s sovereign interests in their own environmental \nregulations.  \nSecond, federal overregulation delays, if not \nkills, much-needed development. A recent news arti-\ncle highlighted just a few of the problems various \ntypes of projects face in dealing with federal regula-\ntors. Amy Joi O\u2019Donoghue, What\u2019s up with delays on \nprojects on federal lands? Deseret.com (May 27, \n\n11 \n2024).6 Everyone recognizes the benefits from and \nneed for diverse energy sources. But \u201c[d]espite being a \ncarbon free and abundant source of energy in Utah, \ntapping geothermal resources working through the \nBureau of Land Management is likened by some in the \nindustry as a nagging, painful canker sore that pre-\nsents no cure.\u201d Id. One company nominated BLM con-\ntrolled land for geothermal exploration in 2008 and \ncompleted an environmental assessment more than \nseven years ago, but still can\u2019t move forward. Id. \nOther companies nominated BLM land for geothermal \nexploration, spent years on technical due diligence, in-\ncluding time and capital, and had planned on more \ncapital expenditures, only to have BLM abruptly an-\nnounce that it was deferring leasing the land until late \n2025. Id. The federal delays and inconsistencies in \nUtah push geothermal developers to other states. Id.  \nOil and gas producers are also finding it diffi-\ncult to lease land from federal regulators. One indus-\ntry representative explained that \u201cYou can be held up \nfor years waiting for a lease to come up and then let\u2019s \nsay if it does, if it is litigated\u2014which almost all of \nthem have been since 2016\u2014then you can have the \nBLM saying well, we\u2019re uncertain what this litigation \nis going to look like so we\u2019re just going to hold up your \napplication to drill permit.\u201d Id.    \nThe TransWest Express high-voltage transmis-\nsion line, crossing parts of four states including Utah, \nlikewise faced inexplicable delay. It took nine years to \nget right-of-way approvals, then another five years to \ncomplete right-of-way requirements to move forward \nwith construction. Id.    \n \n6https://www.deseret.com/utah/2024/05/27/whats-up-with-\ndelays-on-projects-on-federal-lands/. \n\n12 \nAnd it remains uncertain whether a long \nplanned four-mile, four-lane highway will be built in \nsouthern Utah. Federal agencies granted approval to \nproceed in 2021. But conservation groups sued over \nthe project and, as part of a settlement in that suit, \nthe federal agencies announced they would revisit the \nhighway\u2019s approval and conduct a new review. Id. All \nthis has left state and federal leaders wondering what \ntransportation needs can be realistically satisfied un-\nder current federal regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine \nwe [can] do the things that we need to do to support \nour economy, our society,\u201d the director of Utah\u2019s De-\npartment of Transportation said. \u201cToday, it seems like \nit\u2019s much harder to do things that matter.\u201d Id. \nFederal regulations don\u2019t need to be applied \nthis way. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s overbroad application of \nNEPA only exacerbates the federal overregulation \nproblem.   \n \nConclusion \nThe Court should reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s \njudgment below.  \n \n\n13 \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n /s/ Stanford E. Purser  \n \nStanford E.

The Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project from which this case arises offers \njust such an opportunity. Utah state and federal offi-\ncials, as noted herein, have stated their strong support \nin seeing this railway project come to fruition for a va-\nriety of reasons, from economic to environmental to \nsafety.  \nPetitioners have shown the legal reasons\u2014in-\ncluding a circuit split over the meaning of this Court\u2019s \nprecedent\u2014why the Court should grant review in this \ncase. The State agrees. But in Utah, the petition for \nwrit of certiorari and this case affects far more than \nclarifying precedent and resolving circuit splits. The \nUinta Basin Railway project (Railway or Project) will \nhelp thousands of Utah residents, various local gov-\nernments, and the State itself. So Utah submits this \namicus brief to highlight how important the Railway \nis to, and the positive impacts it would have on, the \nrelevant counties, the State, and its residents.   \n \nIntroduction and Summary of Argument \nDespite its wealth of natural resources, Utah\u2019s \nUintah Basin has been a relatively underdeveloped \nregion in Utah for decades. See JA1304-05. That\u2019s be-\ncause, at least in part, the only access points to the \nUintah Basin are two-lane roads that present freight \ntransportation challenges. So for years, the Seven-\nCounty Infrastructure Coalition (Seven County) has \n \n1The parties\u2019 counsel of record received timely notice of \nUtah\u2019s intent to file this brief under Supreme Court Rule 37.2. \n\n2 \nchampioned the Uinta Basin Railway: an over 80-mile \nrail line that would connect the Basin with the na-\ntional rail network and unlock the region\u2019s economic \npotential. See, e.g., JA798. Utah\u2019s leaders at the state \nand federal level have voiced their support for the Pro-\nject. See, e.g., JA245, JA540-41, JA796-97.  \nIn December 2021, after a long regulatory pro-\ncess, the Surface Transportation Board issued its final \napproval of the Railway. The Board\u2019s final approval \ncame after it had considered the Project\u2019s transporta-\ntion merits, conducted a thorough and reasoned re-\nview of the Project\u2019s reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects falling within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction \nper Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. 752 (2004), received voluminous public com-\nments, and imposed extensive mitigation measures to \nreduce the Project\u2019s environmental impact. See gener-\nally Pet. App. 83a-123a; see also id. at 108a (discuss-\ning Public Citizen). The Board found that the Project \nadvanced important transportation benefits that out-\nweighed mitigated environmental impacts. Pet. App. \n122a. So the Board exercised its discretion under the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act\u2014\nwhich promotes railway development for the public \ngood\u2014and approved the Project. Id.; see 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10101 (stating federal policy in regulating railroad in-\ndustry).   \nAdhering to a different view of Public Citizen, \nthe panel below determined, in part, that the Board\u2019s \nanalysis was inadequate because it did not weigh \nspeculative environmental impacts the Railway might \ncause upstream or downline in other parts of the coun-\ntry and over which the Board had no regulatory au-\nthority. See, e.g., Pet. App. 36a-37a, 66a-68a, 70a. In \nthe panel\u2019s words, the Board\u2019s position \u201cthat it need \nnot consider [environmental] effects it cannot prevent \n\n3 \nis simply inapplicable\u201d because the Board can weigh \nwhether a \u201crailway\u2019s anticipated environmental and \nother costs outweigh its expected benefits.\u201d Id. at 37a.  \nThe panel\u2019s take on Public Citizen\u2019s meaning is \nwrong and conflicts with several other circuit courts. \nPet. at 14-23. The Court should grant certiorari re-\nview for that reason alone. But even beyond the \npanel\u2019s legal error, the decision overlooks the many \nbenefits the Railway will bring to Utah, the Uintah \nBasin, and its residents. Utah files this amicus to ex-\nplain why this Project matters to the State and its res-\nidents.   \n \nArgument \nThe State of Utah has championed the Uinta \nBasin Railway from the beginning because the Project \nwill promote the development of local and statewide \neconomies and improve the lives of Utahns. See, e.g., \nJA245. The Railway will be critical infrastructure fa-\ncilitating the flow of commodities to and from the Uin-\ntah Basin. It has the potential to open the region to \nentirely new markets that rely on freight shipping and \nto create jobs. And it will do so while protecting the \nenvironment and Utah\u2019s transportation workers. \nBlocking the Project stifles economic, environmental, \nand safety improvements in the region and hurts area \nresidents. The State of Utah urges this Court to view \nthe Railway as a vital investment in critical infra-\nstructure that will benefit the Uintah Basin, the State \nof Utah, its residents, and the Ute Tribe. Projects like \nthe Uinta Basin Railway realize the policies that pro-\nmote the importance and development of the rural \nAmerican economy.   \n \n\n4 \nI. \nThe Railway promotes the development of \nstrong and diverse economies in some of \nUtah\u2019s most economically fragile counties.  \nThe Board concluded that the Project would \nprovide an alternative, more cost-effective method of \ntransportation for shippers that are currently limited \nto shipping by truck. Pet. App. 119a. This, in turn, \nwould eliminate longstanding transportation con-\nstraints, allow entry into new markets, help diversify \nUintah Basin economies, and create more jobs\u2014all of \nwhich advance Rail Transportation Policy factors that \nthe Board must consider. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(2), (4), \n(5) & (7). And the Board was right. \nCarbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties\u2014in \nwhich the Railway would be located\u2014all rank in the \nbottom half of Utah counties in terms of per capita in-\ncome. Utah Econ. Council, Econ. Rep. to the Governor \nat 47 (2021).2  They\u2019re also some of the least economi-\ncally diverse counties in Utah, despite Utah\u2019s high \nmarks for statewide economic diversity. See DJ Ben-\nway, Measuring Econ. Diversity: The Hachman Index, \n2018 (Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute Apr. 2020)3; see \nalso JA1304-05. To build a new rural economy in the \nregion, significant investment will be needed, includ-\ning investments in strategic infrastructure. As the \nBoard recognized, the Railway has the potential to ad-\nvance many rail policy objectives by addressing these \n \n2https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/up-\nloads/ERG2021.pdf?x71849. \n3https://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/Hachman-\nBrief-Apr2020.pdf#:~:text=Salt%20Lake%2C%20We-\nber%2C%20Davis%2C%20and%20Washington%20coun-\nties%20are,level%2C%20shows%20the%20economic%20dispar-\nity%20of%20Utah%E2%80%99s%20counties. \n\n5 \nproblems. See Pet. App. 119a-121a. The Railway likely \n\u201cwill boost economic opportunity and local job creation \nby allowing energy, agricultural, mining products, \nand manufactured goods, to reach global markets \nmore easily.\u201d JA796. Businesses that rely on shipping \nby freight will be able to open locations in the previ-\nously inaccessible region, which has the potential to \nopen new markets and create jobs. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n10101(2), (4), (5) & (7).  \nThese developments will also provide signifi-\ncant economic benefits to the Ute Indian Tribe of the \nUintah and Ouray Reservation, which similarly sup-\nported the project. JA1315-16 (Ute Tribe noting that \n\u201c[o]il and gas production on the reservation is the most \nsignificant source of revenue for the Ute Indian Tribe\u201d \nand urging the Board to \u201cmove swiftly with final ap-\nproval and issuance of license\u201d). This Railway prom-\nises to bring tremendous economic opportunities to \nthe people of Carbon, Uintah, and Duchesne counties.  \nUnsurprisingly, all three counties have been vocal ad-\nvocates for the Railway. JA582 (\u201cCarbon County be-\nlieves that the Uinta Basin Railway project will fill a \ngap in major infrastructure that will help develop and \ndiversify the regional economy.\u201d); JA579 (\u201cThe Duch-\nesne County Commission believes that the Uinta Ba-\nsin Railway project will fulfill a critical infrastructure \nneed. The railway is anticipated to help diversify the \nregional economy as businesses needing rail access \nwould then be able to consider locations in the ba-\nsin.\u201d); JA593 (noting Uintah County has sought a \n\u201cstandard-gauge freight-only railway into the Uinta \nBasin\u201d that would connect the community \u201cto the na-\ntional railway network\u201d since the county released its \n2017 General Plan (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)).  \n\n6 \nThe Project and its supporters are trying to do \nmore than pay lip service to the importance of building \nrural economies. The Board\u2019s analysis and final ap-\nproval recognized the importance of these benefits and \nproperly weighed them in favor of approval. Pet. App. \n119a-121a. \n \nII. \nThe Railway will unlock the Uintah Ba-\nsin\u2019s economic potential while protecting \nthe environment and promoting safety. \nThe Uintah Basin \u201cis rich in natural resources \nincluding hydrocarbons, phosphates, and other miner-\nals critical to America\u2019s economy\u2014but the develop-\nment of these resources has long been impaired by the \nlack of quality freight transportation infrastructure.\u201d \nJA1304. Currently, the region\u2019s industry depends on \ntrucks to transport products in and out of the area. \nJA579. By investing in freight rail infrastructure, this \nRailway offers to break that dependence, which has \n\u201champered the economic vitality of the area and pre-\nsents a considerable obstacle to diversifying future \ngrowth, increasing transportation safety, and reduc-\ning congestion.\u201d JA796. Businesses that rely on rail \naccess will be able, for the first time, to consider loca-\ntions in the Uintah Basin. JA579.   \nImportantly, the Project will advance these eco-\nnomic objectives while promoting safety in transpor-\ntation and reducing overall emissions related to trans-\nporting goods in and out of the Uintah Basin. 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101(3), (5), (8), (14). Transporting freight \nby rail instead of by truck would have a significant im-\npact in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from the \nUintah Basin\u2019s industry. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., The Posi-\ntive Env\u2019t Effects of Increased Freight by Rail Move-\nments in America at 3 (June 2020) (\u201cIf 25% of the truck \n\n7 \ntraffic moving at least 750 miles went by rail instead, \nannual fuel savings would be some 1.2 billion gallons \nand annual greenhouse gas emissions would fall by \napproximately 13.1 million tons,\u201d and \u201c[i]f 50% of the \ntruck traffic moving at least 750 miles went by rail in-\nstead, annual fuel savings would be approximately 2.3 \nbillion gallons and greenhouse gas emissions would \nfall by approximately 26.2 million tons.\u201d).4 Freight \nrail\u2019s fuel efficiency in the United States has been in-\ncreasing for nearly four decades straight.

As such, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain entirely stable, anchored by the analysis of the principal and government briefs.\n\nMy understanding of the case's legal dynamics is unchanged and continues to be structured around the three competing frameworks presented to the Court:\n\n1.  **Petitioners' \"Proximate Cause\" Test:** A narrow standard limiting NEPA review to effects directly caused by the agency's action and falling within its specific regulatory authority, based on *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*.\n\n2.  **Respondents' \"Reasonable Foreseeability\" Test:** A broad standard arguing that if an environmental effect is reasonably foreseeable, it must be included in the NEPA analysis, a position grounded in their interpretation of CEQ regulations and the 2023 NEPA amendments.\n\n3.  **Solicitor General's \"Rule of Reason\" Framework:** This remains the pivotal argument and the most probable basis for the Court's decision. It proposes a middle path, rejecting the absolutist positions of the parties. The SG argues that while foreseeability is a necessary starting point, the analysis is ultimately governed by a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" (*Metropolitan Edison*) and a \"rule of reason.\" This framework grants agencies the discretion to draw reasonable, context-specific boundaries for their analysis, which courts should review under a deferential \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard.\n\nThe SG's brief continues to be the dispositive piece of evidence shaping my prediction. Its key contributions, which remain unchallenged by this latest observation, are:\n\n*   **Defusing the 2023 NEPA Amendments:** The SG's argument that recent streamlining amendments should not be interpreted as mandating a *more expansive* review remains a potent rebuttal to the respondents' primary statutory claim. This interpretation preserves the \"close causal relationship\" requirement from *Metropolitan Edison* alongside the foreseeability test.\n*   **Providing an \"Administrative Deference\" Path:** The SG's framework offers the Court a clear and precedented way to reverse the D.C. Circuit without adopting the petitioners' rigid proximate cause test. The Court can issue a narrow ruling that reaffirms agency deference principles from *Public Citizen* and *Metropolitan Edison*, finding the STB acted reasonably in defining the scope of its review.\n\nThis observation simply confirms that my analysis is still missing a complete picture of the amicus support for both petitioners and respondents. This information gap, while noted, does not alter the fundamental legal analysis based on the briefs from the parties directly involved and the U.S. government. My confidence remains high that the Court will reverse the D.C. Circuit, with the SG's moderate, agency-deferential framework providing the most likely vehicle for that reversal.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous beliefs were anchored in the legal arguments presented by the petitioners, respondents, and the Solicitor General, with a specific acknowledgment that I lacked information on amicus brief support. This new observation begins to fill that identified gap, providing the first concrete evidence of amicus support in the case. While the search was for briefs supporting the respondents, it exclusively returned documents related to a significant amicus brief filed by the **State of Utah** in support of the **Petitioners**.\n\nThis new information significantly strengthens the case for reversal by adding a powerful new dimension to the petitioners' position. My understanding of the case's dynamics now incorporates the following:\n\n1.  **Introduction of a Strong Federalism and States' Rights Argument:** The State of Utah's brief introduces a potent argument that was not central to the principal briefs. Utah argues that the D.C. Circuit's expansive interpretation of NEPA presumes that only federal agencies can protect the environment, thereby ignoring and intruding upon Utah's own sovereign interests and its comprehensive state-level regulatory schemes for oil and gas, air, and water quality. This frames the case not just as a matter of statutory interpretation, but as an issue of federal overreach that sidelines state authority. This is a classic federalism argument that is likely to resonate with several justices.\n\n2.  **Bolstering of Policy Arguments for the Project:** The Utah brief provides concrete, compelling policy justifications for the railway that go beyond abstract legal tests. It highlights:\n    *   **Economic Development:** The project is framed as a vital investment for diversifying the economies of some of Utah's most \"economically fragile counties.\"\n    *   **Environmental & Safety Benefits:** The brief argues that shifting freight from trucks to rail is a net positive for the environment, as rail transport lowers greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% compared to trucks. It also improves public safety by reducing truck traffic.\n    *   **Anti-Overregulation Theme:** The brief situates the D.C. Circuit's decision within a broader narrative of \"federal overregulation\" that needlessly delays and kills critical infrastructure projects, a theme with considerable traction in judicial and political discourse.\n\n3.  **Reinforcement of the \"Rule of Reason\" Framework:** The arguments presented by Utah directly support the Solicitor General's \"rule of reason\" framework. By detailing the project's local benefits and the state's own regulatory role, the brief reinforces the idea that the Surface Transportation Board (STB) acted reasonably in defining the scope of its analysis. It provides the Court with a clear, real-world example of why an agency should be given deference to draw sensible boundaries, rather than being forced to analyze speculative, remote effects over which it has no control and other sovereigns (like Utah) have authority.\n\nMy core understanding of the three competing legal frameworks (Petitioners' \"proximate cause,\" Respondents' \"reasonable foreseeability,\" and the SG's \"rule of reason\") remains stable. However, the Utah amicus brief adds a substantial layer of policy and structural arguments that makes the SG's deferential approach\u2014and thus a reversal of the D.C. Circuit\u2014more appealing and justifiable. My confidence in a reversal has increased. The SG's framework remains the most probable vehicle for that reversal, but it is now buttressed by potent federalism and economic arguments that provide the Court with additional, powerful reasons to rule in favor of the petitioners. The primary remaining uncertainty is the nature and strength of amicus support for the respondents, which is necessary to have a complete picture of the arguments before the Court.",

A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-71a) \nis reported at 82 F.4th 1152.  The decisions of the Sur-\nface Transportation Board (Pet. App. 74a-189a, 190a-\n230a) are available at 2021 WL 41926 and 2021 WL \n5960905. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nAugust 18, 2023.  A petition for rehearing en banc was \n \n1  The federal respondents supporting petitioners represented by \nthe Solicitor General in this brief include the Surface Transporta-\ntion Board.  Although the Board did not participate at the certiorari \nstage (see Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 2 n.1), it was a party before the court of \nappeals and is therefore a respondent in this Court.   \n\n2 \n \ndenied on December 4, 2023 (Pet. App. 72a-73a).  The \npetition for a writ of certiorari was filed on March 4, \n2024, and granted on June 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of \nthis Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1) and 2350. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-14a.   \nSTATEMENT \n1. Enacted in 1970, the National Environmental Pol-\nicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 \n(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), establishes a set of \u201c\u200a\u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d before un-\ndertaking major federal actions that will affect the en-\nvironment.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989) (citation omitted).  Congress \ndeclared that the purpose of those procedural require-\nments is to encourage efforts to \u201cprevent or eliminate \ndamage to the environment\u201d and improve public health \nand welfare, while also enhancing understanding of the \nenvironment. 42 U.S.C. 4321; accord Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 756 (2004) \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 4321); see 42 U.S.C. 4331 (describing \ntenets of the \u201cnational environmental policy\u201d) (empha-\nsis omitted).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural provision requires agencies \nto prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d in connection with a \nproposal for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affect-\ning the quality of the human environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C).  As originally enacted, the statute required \nthese environmental impact statements to include  \nanalysis of (among other things) the \u201cenvironmental im-\npact of the proposed action\u201d and any unavoidable \u201cad-\nverse environmental effects\u201d of the proposal.  NEPA  \n\n3 \n \n\u00a7 102(c)(i) and (ii), 83 Stat. 853.  The original statute also \nestablished the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \na new entity charged with overseeing the national envi-\nronmental policy the statute pronounced.  42 U.S.C. \n4342.   \nIn a set of 2023 amendments enacted after the \nagency decisions in this case, Congress clarified the ap-\npropriate scope of an environmental impact statement \nby specifying that the statement should analyze the \n\u201creasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the \nproposed agency action.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see \nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (2023 Act), Pub. L. No. \n118-5, Div. C, Tit. III, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38.  Be-\nfore that amendment, longstanding CEQ regulations \nhad similarly specified that agencies should consider \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of \ntheir proposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 \n(Nov. 29, 1978) (40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979)).  In 2020, \nCEQ had revised the regulations to define \u201c[r]easona-\nbly foreseeable\u201d to mean \u201csufficiently likely to occur \nsuch that a person of ordinary prudence would take it \ninto account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) (2021)) \n(emphasis omitted).  That definition remains in place to-\nday.  See 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa).  \n2. a. The Surface Transportation Board (Board) is \na federal agency that regulates rail carriers and rail-\nroads.  Because the Board is the successor to the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission, its authority is set out in \nthe ICC Termination Act of 1995 (the Interstate Com-\nmerce Act), Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (49 U.S.C. \n10101 et seq.).   \nThe Interstate Commerce Act grants the Board \u201cex-\nclusive\u201d federal jurisdiction over \u201ctransportation by rail \n\n4 \n \ncarrier[s]\u201d and \u201cthe construction, acquisition, opera-\ntion, abandonment, or discontinuance\u201d of railway lines \nand related facilities.  49 U.S.C. 10501(b)(2).  The Act \nalso charges the Board with enforcing the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[c]ommon-carrier\u201d obligation, which requires railroads \nto carry all commodities upon reasonable request\u2014 \nincluding hazardous and other environmentally-sensitive \nmaterials.  See 49 U.S.C. 11101; Riffin v. Surface Transp. \nBd., 733 F.3d 340, 345-347 (D.C. Cir. 2013); accord Ak-\nron, Canton & Youngstown R.R. v. ICC, 611 F.2d 1162, \n1166-1168 (6th Cir. 1979) (common-carrier railroad \nmust carry nuclear waste), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 830 \n(1980).   \nb. An entity that wishes to construct or operate a \nnew railroad line must generally seek a license from the \nBoard.  49 U.S.C. 10901.  One way to obtain a license is \nto file an application with the Board.  See 49 U.S.C. \n10901(c).  This approach initiates a process that involves \npublic notice and a proceeding to evaluate the applica-\ntion, and the Board is required to \u201cissue a certificate au-\nthorizing\u201d the construction \u201cunless the Board finds that \nsuch activities are inconsistent with the public conven-\nience and necessity.\u201d  Ibid.; see 49 C.F.R. 1151.2.  \nAlternatively, as in this case, an applicant may re-\nquest Board authorization through a more summary \n\u201cexemption\u201d process under 49 U.S.C. 10502.  The Board \nmay grant an exemption when it finds that a full pro-\nceeding under Section 10901 \u201cis not necessary to carry \nout the rail transportation policy of [S]ection 10101\u201d of \nthe Interstate Commerce Act, and that either the \n\u201ctransaction or service is of limited scope\u201d or full pro-\nceedings are \u201cnot needed to protect shippers from the \nabuse of market power.\u201d  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under the \nexemption process, the Board does not apply the \u201cpublic \n\n5 \n \nconvenience and necessity\u201d standard from Section \n10901(c); instead the Board assesses the transportation \nmerits of the construction or operation proposal based \non statutorily enumerated policies for \u201cregulating the \nrailroad industry\u201d set out in 49 U.S.C. 10101.  See 49 \nU.S.C. 10502(a)(1).  The Act provides that \u201cthe Board, \nto the maximum extent consistent with [the Act],\u201d shall \ngrant an exemption when it finds these criteria satis-\nfied.  49 U.S.C. 10502(a).  Under both the application \nand exemption processes, there is a presumption in fa-\nvor of approving rail construction projects. \n3. a. Petitioners seek to construct an 85-mile-long \nrailway line in Utah connecting the Uinta Basin in \nnortheastern Utah to the existing interstate freight rail \nnetwork near Kyune, Utah.  Pet. App. 190a-191a.  Be-\ncause the Basin is surrounded by high mountains and \nplateaus with elevations up to 13,000 feet above sea \nlevel, transportation options are limited.  C.A. App. 259-\n260, 822.  Freight must currently be transported by \ntruck on two-lane highways.  Pet. App. 7a.  A new rail-\nway line would furnish an additional transportation op-\ntion for moving goods into and out of the Basin.  Ibid.  \nAnd because waxy crude oil is the main commodity cur-\nrently transported by trucks in the Uinta Basin, that \nwould be the new line\u2019s primary freight.  Ibid. \nIn May 2020, petitioners sought the Board\u2019s author-\nization for the railway line by invoking the Interstate \nCommerce Act\u2019s exemption process under Section \n10502.  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  The Board conducted the ex-\nemption process in this case through bifurcated pro-\nceedings.  Id. at 9a-11a.  The Board issued a preliminary \ndecision in January 2021 addressing the transportation \nmerits of the proposed project before the Board\u2019s envi-\nronmental analysis was complete, id. at 9a, and then is-\n\n6 \n \nsued a final decision taking account of the completed en-\nvironmental analysis later that same year, id. at 10a-\n11a.   \nb. The environmental analysis involved multiple \nstages.  In October 2020, the Board issued a draft envi-\nronmental impact statement in connection with the pro-\nject.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Board then opened a public com-\nment process that continued until February 12, 2021.  \nDuring that process, the Board conducted six public \nmeetings and received over 1900 comments.  Ibid.  In \nAugust 2021, the Board issued its final environmental \nimpact statement.  Id. at 76a.   \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nspanned more than 600 pages.  It was supported by \nmore than 2200 pages of appendices containing tech-\nnical analysis and other materials, as well as a separate \n728-page document with the Board\u2019s responses to public \ncomments\u2014resulting in more than 3600 pages of analy-\nsis in total.2 \nThe Board\u2019s final environmental impact statement \nidentified and analyzed a series of \u201csignificant and ad-\nverse impacts that could occur as a result of the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 121.  Those impacts included the \ndisturbance of local \u201cwaters and wetlands\u201d that would \noccur due to the line\u2019s construction, the \u201cwayside noise\u201d \nthat would be created by the trains newly running \nthrough the area, J.A. 123-124, the alterations to land \nuse and recreation, J.A. 124, and the effects on \u201c[t]ribal \n[c]oncerns\u201d\u2014although the Board noted that the tribe \nwhose land is in the Basin supported the project, J.A. \n125-126; see Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray \nReservation Amici Br. (filed Apr. 4, 2024).  The environ-\n \n2 The full statement and appendices are available at http://www. \nuintabasinrailwayeis.com/DocumentsAndLinks.aspx.   \n\n7 \n \nmental impact statement also considered several \u201cmi-\nnor impacts\u201d that \u201cwould not be significant\u201d if certain \nmitigation measures were adopted.  J.A. 126.  Those im-\npacts included \u201cair quality and greenhouse gas[]\u201d emis-\nsions in the area of construction and the effect of the \nnew construction on local big game, fish, and wildlife.  \nJ.A. 132 (capitalization and emphasis omitted); see J.A. \n126-134.  In addition, the statement considered the \n\u201cdownline impacts\u201d that the new railway line would cre-\nate on existing lines by increasing the volume of traffic.  \nJ.A. 134.  And the statement considered the cumulative \nimpacts of the project, addressing the \u201crelevant past, \npresent, and reasonably foreseeable projects and ac-\ntions that could have impacts that coincide in time and \nlocation with the potential impacts of the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 135; see J.A. 135-136.  \nAmong the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d the Board identi-\nfied were the effects of increased oil production in the \nUinta Basin spurred by the increased transportation ca-\npacity for oil furnished by the new railroad line.  J.A. \n135.  Although the Board found that there were many \nunknowns and uncertainties in connection with the con-\nsequences of additional oil and gas development, the \nagency nonetheless estimated the amount of oil and gas \nthat might be produced and the total amount of new oil \nwells and other infrastructure that might be con-\nstructed in the Basin if the railway was built, using \n\u201cconservative\u201d assumptions that \u201cmay overstate total \nfuture oil production in the Basin.\u201d  J.A. 353; see J.A. \n351-362.  The Board also analyzed the environmental ef-\nfects from that increased oil production on each rele-\nvant resource in the Basin to the extent it could without \nany information regarding specific projects and plans.  \nSee J.A. 365-474.   \n\n8 \n \nThe Board specifically found that there were many \nuncertainties regarding the downstream effects of re-\nfining the oil that would be transported over the line.  \nJ.A. 420-423.  The Board explained that it \u201cgenerally \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines\u201d and \u201cthat railroads \nhave a common carrier obligation to carry all commodi-\nties, including hazardous materials, upon reasonable re-\nquest under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101.\u201d  J.A. 421.  The Board \nrecognized, however, that much of the oil transported \nout of the Basin on the new line would likely go to refin-\neries and end-users for combustion, which would pro-\nduce emissions that contribute to \u201cglobal warming and \nclimate change.\u201d  J.A. 420.  The Board estimated the ag-\ngregate amount of greenhouse gas emissions from its \nestimation of the potential increase in combustion, us-\ning a set of assumptions that the Board described as \n\u201cconservative\u201d and that \u201cmay overstate\u201d the potential \nemissions.  J.A. 423.  The Board found that its high-end \nestimate would represent approximately 0.8% of nation-\nwide greenhouse gas emissions and 0.1% of global emis-\nsions.  Ibid.   \nc. In an appendix to the final environmental impact \nstatement responding to public comments on the draft \nstatement, the Board addressed comments suggesting \nthat it should have given more detailed consideration to \nthe effects of upstream and downstream oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  J.A. 520-529.  Some commenters had sug-\ngested that the Board \u201cshould have treated potential \nenvironmental impacts that could result from potential \nfuture, as yet unplanned, oil and gas development pro-\njects in the Basin as direct or indirect impacts of the \nproposed rail line, rather than treating [such] projects \n\n9 \n \nas reasonably foreseeable future actions that could con-\ntribute to cumulative impacts.\u201d  J.A. 520. \nIn responding to those comments, the Board ex-\nplained that further analysis of the posited effects \n\u201cwould not inform the Board\u2019s decision on [petitioners\u2019 \nproposal] to construct and operate\u201d the new railroad \nline.  J.A. 521.  The Board observed that a NEPA anal-\nysis has two purposes:  (1) to ensure that, \u201cin reaching \nits decision,\u201d the agency has available and may \u201ccare-\nfully consider[] detailed information concerning signifi-\ncant environmental impacts,\u201d and (2) to \u201cguarantee[] \nthat the relevant information will be made available to \nthe larger audience that may also play a role\u201d in the de-\ncision and its implementation.  Ibid. (quoting Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 768) (citation omitted).   \nThe Board described several reasons that more de-\ntailed information about particular oil and gas develop-\nment that might occur would not serve either of those \npurposes.  J.A. 521-529.  The Board observed that it \n\u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation by rail carri-\ners,\u201d and that it had prepared the environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its decision \u201cunder 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10502\u201d as to whether to grant petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest \u201cto construct and operate a new rail line\u201d in the \nUinta Basin.  J.A. 522; see ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501).  \nThe decision before the Board was therefore \u201cwhether \nto authorize, deny, or authorize with conditions\u201d peti-\ntioners\u2019 \u201cproposal to construct and operate the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cOil and gas development [was] \nnot part of\u200a\u201d the proposed agency action before the \nBoard and would be \u201csubject to the approval processes \nof other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Board also found that it \u201clack[ed] sufficient con-\ntrol over future oil and gas development projects to \n\n10 \n \nmake those projects part of the proposed action as-\nsessed in the [environmental impact statement].\u201d  J.A. \n523.  The Board acknowledged that \u201cthe availability of \na rail transportation option would benefit the oil and gas \nindustry\u201d in the Basin, but it observed that the \u201cindus-\ntry is already well-established\u201d and that the Board\u2019s au-\nthority to prevent or minimize oil and gas development \nis constrained because the Board \u201ccan only impose con-\nditions that are consistent with its statutory authority \nover rail transportation by rail carriers under the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act.\u201d  Ibid.   \nFurther, the Board explained that the environmental \nconsequences of future oil and gas development in the \nUinta Basin were both \u201cspeculative\u201d and attenuated.  \nJ.A. 525; see J.A. 527-529.  The Board observed that \nmany oil and gas development projects in the Basin had \n\u201cnot yet been proposed or planned.\u201d  J.A. 528.  It further \nobserved that the extent of future oil and gas develop-\nment would involve \u201cmany separate and independent \nprojects\u201d in the Basin that could vary in terms of the \nfederal, state, tribal, or private character of the land, \nand the \u201cscale\u201d and nature of the projects themselves.  \nIbid.  The Board also noted that \u201cit would not be possi-\nble to determine which of these as yet unproposed, un-\nplanned, and unsponsored projects would or would not \nproceed.\u201d  J.A. 528-529.  For all these reasons, the \nBoard found that it was \u201cnot possible to\u201d say that any \nsuch projects were \u201cproximately caused by the pro-\nposed rail line.\u201d  J.A. 529.   \nAs to the downstream consequences of transporting \noil over the proposed line, the Board observed that \n\u201ccrude oil produced in the Basin is currently trans-\nported to refiners in the Salt Lake City area\u201d that have \n\u201climitations on the volume of crude oil\u201d they can accept.  \n\n11 \n \nJ.A. 528.  The Board found that \u201cit is possible that addi-\ntional capacity could be added at those refineries in the \nfuture.\u201d  Ibid.  But the Board observed that refining \nmight increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \u201cde-\npend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Board\u2019s response to the comments did not dis-\ncuss particular refineries in other locations, such as the \nTexas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts and Puget Sound, to \nwhich oil from the Basin might ultimately be shipped.  \nBut the environmental impact statement acknowledged \nthe possibility of increased refining in those areas.  J.A. \n477-482.  The Board determined in the statement that \nmuch of the oil would likely be transported to \u201cmarkets \nin other regions of the United States,\u201d J.A. 477, and to \nthe Gulf Coast and Puget Sound areas in particular, J.A. \n478, but the Board observed that \u201c[t]he final destina-\ntions of the trains would depend on the ability and will-\ningness of refineries in other markets to receive rail \ncars carrying Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil \nin their refineries.\u201d J.A. 477.  Still, the Board prepared \nestimates of how much potential oil development in the \nUinta Basin might increase transportation of oil to the \nGulf Coast and Puget Sound.  J.A. 481-482.   \nd. Ultimately, the Board\u2019s final decision authorized \nconstruction and operation of the proposed railroad \nline.  Pet. App. 74a-123a.  The Board\u2019s final decision re-\nviewed the environmental effects described in the final \nenvironmental impact statement at length.  See id. at \n83a-117a.   \nIn addressing the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development, the Board reaf-\nfirmed its prior analysis.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The \nBoard explained that it had \u201cestimated aggregate emis-\nsions from potential future oil and gas development \n\n12 \n \nbased on the best available information regarding emis-\nsions from oil and gas production in the Basin.\u201d  Id. at \n106a.  It further acknowledged that, \u201c[t]o the extent \nthat\u201d crude oil transported on the line \u201cwould be com-\nbusted to produce energy, emissions from the combus-\ntion of the fuels would produce\u201d greenhouse gasses, \nwhich could represent \u201cup to approximately 0.8% of na-\ntionwide\u201d emissions and 0.1% of global emissions.  Ibid.  \nBut the Board found that \u201cthe actual volumes of crude \noil that would move over the Line would depend on var-\nious independent variables and influences, including \ngeneral domestic and global economic conditions, com-\nmodity pricing, the strategic and capital investment de-\ncisions of oil producers, and future market demand for \ncrude oil from the Basin,  * * *  among other factors.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nThe Board rejected the contention that it had given \ninsufficient consideration to the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil production and refining.  Pet. App. \n107a.  The Board reiterated that it \u201chas no authority or \njurisdiction over development of oil and gas in the Basin \nnor any authority to control or mitigate the impacts of \nany such development.\u201d  Id. at 108a.  And it repeated \nthat \u201c[o]il and gas development that may occur follow-\ning authorization of [the new railroad line] would entail \nmany separate and independent projects that have not \nyet been proposed or planned and that could occur on \nprivate, state, tribal, or federal land and could range in \nscale from a single vertical oil well to a large lease.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIn the end, the Board recognized that the new rail-\nroad line was \u201clikely to produce unavoidable environ-\nmental impacts,\u201d but it found that it could impose \u201cex-\ntensive mitigation conditions\u201d to \u201cminimize those im-\n\n13 \n \npacts to the extent practicable.\u201d  Pet. App. 118a-119a.  \nIt also determined that \u201cconstruction and operation of\u201d \nthe new line would \u201chave substantial transportation and \neconomic benefits\u201d that outweighed the environmental \nconcerns.  Id. at 119a.   \n4. Eagle County, Colorado and several environmen-\ntal organizations (collectively, the \u201cnon-federal re-\nspondents\u201d) filed petitions for review of the Board\u2019s de-\ncision that were consolidated into a single proceeding \nbefore the court of appeals.  See Pet. App. 9a, 13a.  The \ncourt granted the petitions in part and denied them in \npart.  Id. at 1a-71a.   \nAs relevant here, the court of appeals held that the \nBoard\u2019s environmental impact statement improperly \nexcluded further analysis of the upstream environmen-\ntal effects of increased oil production in the Basin and \nthe localized downstream effects of ultimately pro-\ncessing some of that oil in refineries in Texas and Loui-\nsiana.  Pet. App. 28a-37a.  The court first rejected the \nargument that the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis was invalid \nbecause the Board classified the upstream and down-\nstream consequences of oil and gas development as \u201ccu-\nmulative\u201d rather than \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  Id. at 28a-29a.  \nThe court reasoned that \u201c[e]ven if the Board errone-\nously characterized the impacts,\u201d the challengers had \n\u201cidentif[ied] no way in which this decision materially af-\nfected the Board\u2019s analysis under NEPA.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard had both \u201cacknowledged the impact of increased \noil extraction in the Basin and explained [that] \u2018[t]he im-\npacts and the analysis of those impacts would be the \nsame no matter which label [it] used.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a (quot-\ning id. at 108a & n.15 (Final Exemption Decision)) (first \nset of brackets in original).  The court therefore con-\ncluded that the purported misclassification of the ef-\n\n14 \n \nfects could not \u201cbe said \u2018to undermine informed public \ncomment and informed decisionmaking.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29a-\n30a (citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals agreed, however, with the non-\nfederal respondents\u2019 argument that the Board had \nfailed to justify the absence of further analysis of the \nalleged upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development in the environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  The court concluded that the \nBoard\u2019s limited discussion of those harms could not be \njustified either on the ground that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences were not \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable,\u201d or on the ground that the Board lacked the \nstatutory authority to prevent those consequences.  Id. \nat 30a-31a (citation omitted).    \nAs to reasonable foreseeability, the court of appeals \nheld that the agency could not rely on its \u201c\u200a\u2018lack of infor-\nmation about the\u2019 location of future oil production sites\u201d \nin the Basin and the \u201c\u200a\u2018destination and end use of the \n[oil]\u2019\u200a\u201d after it was transported over the proposed line \nand entered onto existing lines.  Pet. App. 32a (citation \nomitted; brackets in original).  The court stated that, \nwhile \u201cgreat \u2018deference [is] owed to [the Board\u2019s] tech-\nnical judgments,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Board had \u201cfail[ed] to adequately \nexplain why it could not employ \u2018some degree of fore-\ncasting\u2019 to identify the aforementioned upstream and \ndownstream impacts.\u201d  Id. at 35a (citation omitted; first \nand second set of brackets in original).  \nThe court of appeals then rejected the contention \nthat, under this Court\u2019s decision in Public Citizen, su-\npra, the Board was not required to \u201cidentify and de-\nscribe the environmental effects of increased oil drilling \nand refining\u201d because of the Board\u2019s view that it \u201clack[ed] \nauthority to prevent, control, or mitigate those develop-\n\n15 \n \nments.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.  The court reasoned that the \nBoard had the authority to prevent those effects be-\ncause the Board has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the \nconstruction and operation of the railway, including au-\nthority to deny the exemption petition if the environ-\nmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its trans-\nportation benefits.\u201d  Ibid. (citing 49 U.S.C. 10501(c), \n10901(b)).  The court also reasoned that the Board \u201cis \nauthorized to license railroad construction and opera-\ntion based on the \u2018public convenience and necessity,\u2019 \nwhich encompasses reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental harms.\u201d  Id. at 37a (citation omitted).  Based on \nthat analysis, the court decided that \u201cthe Board\u2019s argu-\nment that it need not consider effects it cannot prevent\u201d \nwas \u201csimply inapplicable.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals found a number of other flaws \nin the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis, including a failure to \ntake a hard look at the increased risk of rail accidents \ndownline of the 85 miles of new line, Pet. App. 40a-42a, \nthe risk and impacts of wildfires downline caused by \nsparks from the operation of additional trains, id. at \n42a-45a, and the railway\u2019s impacts on water resources \ndownline on the Colorado River, id. at 46a-47a.  The \ncourt rejected or declined to reach multiple other chal-\nlenges under NEPA and the National Historic Preser-\nvation Act.  Id. at 29a, 37a-39a, 47a-50a, 55a-57a.  And \nthe court found that there were flaws in the biological \nopinion that the Fish and Wildlife Service had provided \nin connection with the project under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, id. at 50a-55a, and in the Board\u2019s exemp-\ntion decision under the Interstate Commerce Act, id. at \n57a-69a.  Petitioners did not seek review of those other \nissues.  \n\n16 \n \nBased on the errors the court of appeals found in the \nNEPA analysis and the biological opinion, the \u201cfail[ure] \nto conduct a reasoned application\u201d of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, and the Board\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to weigh the \n[railway\u2019s] uncertain financial viability and the full po-\ntential for environmental harm against the transporta-\ntion benefits,\u201d the court vacated the Board\u2019s exemption \norder as arbitrary and capricious, and partially vacated \nthe environmental impact statement and biological \nopinion.  Pet. App. 70a; see id. at 70a-71a.   \n5. Petitioners sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied.  Pet. App. 72a-73a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nNEPA did not require the Board to undertake addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development in determining \nwhether to authorize the construction and operation of \nthe proposed railroad line in this case.  The court of ap-\npeals\u2019 contrary decision on that issue should be re-\nversed. \nA. \u201cNEPA declares a broad national commitment to \nprotecting and promoting environmental quality.\u201d  Rob-\nertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, \n348 (1989).  But it is \u201cwell settled that NEPA itself does \nnot mandate particular results.\u201d  Id. at 350.  Rather, the \nstatute realizes its environmental policy goals\u2014i.e., \n\u201cencourag[ing] productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment,\u201d \u201cpromot[ing] efforts \nwhich will prevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment,\u201d and \u201cenrich[ing] the understanding of the eco-\nlogical systems and natural resources important to  \nthe Nation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4321\u2014through \u201ca set of \u2018action-\nforcing\u2019 procedures that require\u201d agencies to \u201ctake a \n\u200a\u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences,\u201d Robertson, \n\n17 \n \n490 U.S. at 350 (citation omitted).  At the heart of \nNEPA\u2019s procedural mandates is the requirement that \nagencies must prepare a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d analyzing \n\u201cenvironmental effects\u201d before undertaking \u201cmajor \nFederal actions significantly affecting the quality of the \nhuman environment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).   \nNEPA\u2019s core procedural mandate is subject to cer-\ntain limits.  Longstanding CEQ regulations, now codi-\nfied in the statute, provide that an agency need only ex-\namine the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects of a pro-\nposed action.  See 2023 Act, \u00a7 321(a)(3)(B), 137 Stat. 38; \n40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) (1979).  In addition, this Court has \nstressed that NEPA does not rely on a \u201cbut-for\u201d stand-\nard of causation; rather, an agency is only required to \nexamine the effects for which the agency\u2019s action is the \n\u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  Department of Transp. v. \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 769 (2004).  That causal \nlimit permits an agency to exclude from its analysis any \neffects the agency \u201chas no ability to prevent  * * *  due \nto its limited statutory authority over the relevant ac-\ntions.\u201d  Id. at 770. \nMoreover, even where an agency\u2019s statutory author-\nity is not so strictly limited, the agency may take ac-\ncount of a variety of context-specific factors in deter-\nmining whether and to what extent the proposed agency \naction is the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of a particular \nharm.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  Thus, an agency \nmay reasonably determine that\u2014based on the scope of \nthe proposed action and the nature and reach of the \nagency\u2019s organic statutes\u2014a harm is so attenuated, \nspeculative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently ma-\nterial to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking that the necessary \ncausal connection is absent or diminished.  Id. at 767.  \nAnd the fact that other governmental entities authorize, \n\n18 \n \nfund, or carry out the specific conduct that gives rise to \nthe environmental issues may likewise inform an agen-\ncy\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasonably close \ncausal relationship\u201d between its own actions and partic-\nular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).  In these various circumstances, the agency \nmay draw a \u201cmanageable line\u201d that excludes any analy-\nsis of a harm if a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d \nis absent or that minimizes the analysis of a harm where \nthe causal connection is less robust.  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted).   \nB. That does not mean that an agency may impose \nartificial restrictions on its NEPA analysis.  An agency \nmay not, for example, exclude consideration of an effect \nmerely because the agency does not directly regulate it \nor because other agencies share regulatory authority in \nthe relevant arena.  Nor may an agency impose arbi-\ntrary bright-line limits based on rigid measures of geo-\ngraphic distance, the timing of an effect, or the number \nof other actors that may contribute to it.  And agencies \ncannot apply the same tort-law standards of proximate \ncause given NEPA\u2019s different purposes and framework.  \nAgencies must instead draw context-specific causal \nlines that accord with \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.   \nC. In this case, the Board drew a reasonable line in \ndeclining to undertake more detailed analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement supporting \nthe authorization of a new railroad line from the Uinta \nBasin.  The Board authorizes railroad construction and \noperation, not the development and use of the commod-\nities that travel over those lines.  Indeed, the Board is \n\n19 \n \nrequired to enforce a common-carrier obligation that \ngenerally prohibits carriers from declining to provide \ntransport based on the nature of the commodity.  And \nother entities, including in some instances other federal \nagencies, have the authority to approve oil and gas de-\nvelopment projects in the Uinta Basin and to regulate \nthe localized effects of refining at the place where oil \nfrom the Basin might ultimately be transported.   \nGiven this statutory framework, the Board explained \nthat the scope of the proposed action was properly char-\nacterized as a decision to permit the construction of a \nnew railroad line providing common carrier service, ra-\nther than a decision to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  The Board also cited many factors that estab-\nlished that the \u201cenvironmental impacts that could po-\ntentially result from potential future oil and gas devel-\nopment projects\u201d were speculative, contingent, and at-\ntenuated from the Board\u2019s proposed action.  J.A. 529.    \nThe Board therefore made a reasonable determina-\ntion not to undertake additional or more detailed analy-\nsis of the upstream and downstream consequences of oil \nand gas development.  J.A. 520-529.  Because that de-\ntermination was not arbitrary or capricious, the court of \nappeals erred in setting it aside, and the court\u2019s decision \non this issue should be reversed.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD REASONA-\nBLY LIMITED ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE UPSTREAM \nAND DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF PETITIONERS\u2019 PRO-\nPOSED RAIL LINE \nNEPA embodies a \u201cnational commitment to protect-\ning and promoting environmental quality,\u201d imple-\nmented primarily through a procedural requirement for \nagencies to analyze the significant environmental ef-\n\n20 \n \nfects of their major actions.  Robertson v. Methow Val-\nley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348 (1989).  Agencies \nmust adhere to NEPA\u2019s procedural command, but the \nstatutory text, this Court\u2019s precedents, and CEQ\u2019s reg-\nulations all recognize that, in preparing its environmen-\ntal impact statement, an agency has considerable lati-\ntude and may draw manageable, context-specific lines \nthat take into account whether and to what extent \nharms have a reasonably close causal relationship to the \nagency\u2019s action and are sufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to further NEPA\u2019s purposes.  \nThe agency\u2019s factual findings and exercise of its expert \njudgment and discretion in determining the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement may be set aside only \nif they are arbitrary and capricious.  See, e.g., Depart-\nment of Transp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 763 \n(2004); Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. \n360, 375-376 (1989). \nIn determining the scope of their environmental \nanalyses, agencies may not impose categorical or artifi-\ncial limits that exclude information about environmen-\ntal harms that have a reasonably close causal connection \nand would materially assist the agency in its decision-\nmaking or the public in providing meaningful input.  But \nin this case, the Board did not rely on any such arbitrary \nlimits.  Rather, the Board relied on several context- \nspecific factors to conclude that the upstream and \ndownstream consequences of oil and gas development \nwere too attenuated, speculative, contingent, and other-\nwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s decisionmak-\ning to warrant additional consideration in the environ-\nmental impact statement.  The Board\u2019s decision was not \narbitrary and capricious, and the court of appeals erred \nin holding otherwise.   \n\n21 \n \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope of Their Envi-\nronmental Impact Statements \nWhen Congress first enacted NEPA in 1970, it re-\nquired agencies to prepare \u201cdetailed statement[s]\u201d ana-\nlyzing \u201cthe environmental impact of\u200a\u201d a proposed major \nfederal action, as well as (among other things) \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which c[ould not] be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  \u00a7102(c)(i) and \n(ii); 83 Stat. 853 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) and (ii) (1970)).  \nCongress did not define the terms \u201cenvironmental im-\npact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[].\u201d  Ibid.  But this Court\u2019s \nprecedents, longstanding practice, and recent NEPA \namendments establish that agencies need only consider \nthe reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences \nfor which the agency action is a \u201clegally relevant cause.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769; see 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C) \n(requiring a \u201cdetailed statement by the responsible of-\nficial on\u2014(i) reasonably foreseeable environmental ef-\nfects of the proposed agency action\u201d).  Moreover, an \nagency\u2019s determination regarding the scope of its envi-\nronmental analysis is necessarily informed by NEPA\u2019s \npurposes and its \u201crule of reason,\u201d as well as the nature \nand scope of the agency\u2019s substantive authority.  And \nthe determination is reviewed under the APA\u2019s defer-\nential \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard.   \nUnder those principles, an agency may draw a man-\nageable, context-specific line that differentiates be-\ntween (1) the significant environmental harms for which \nthe agency\u2019s action is the legally relevant cause and \nwhich will inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking and the \npublic\u2019s input, and (2) the potential harms that are more \nattenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuf-\nficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking, such \n\n22 \n \nthat their consideration is less likely to serve NEPA\u2019s \npurposes or satisfy its rule of reason.  For harms in the \nlatter category, the reasonably close causal connection \nmay be missing entirely, such that the agency need not \nconsider the harm at all, or the connection may be suf-\nficiently removed that the agency may give the harm \nonly limited consideration. \n1.  NEPA plainly requires that an effect be \u201creason-\nably foreseeable\u201d in order to necessitate inclusion in an \nenvironmental impact statement.  CEQ regulations have \nlong provided that agencies should consider the \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d environmental effects of their pro-\nposed actions.  43 Fed. Reg. at 56,004; 40 C.F.R. 1508.8(b) \n(2019).  In 2020, CEQ amended its regulations to clarify \nthat \u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d means \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(aa) (2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. \n1508.1(ii) (2024) (same).  And in 2023, Congress codified \nthis requirement by amending NEPA to specify that  \nan agency must examine the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i); see 2023 Act \u00a7321(a)(3)(B), 137 \nStat. 38.   \nNEPA also permits agencies to refrain from analyz-\ning an effect for which the agency\u2019s action is not the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause.\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 769.  \nThus, in Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against \nNuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), the Court held \nthat NEPA does not incorporate a standard of \u201c\u200a\u2018but for\u2019 \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 774.  Rather, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmen-\ntal effect\u2019\u200a\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a \nreasonably close causal relationship between a change \n\n23 \n \nin the physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  \nIbid.  The Court reiterated that principle in Public Cit-\nizen, holding that \u201ca \u2018but for\u2019 causal relationship is in-\nsufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular \neffect under NEPA and the relevant regulations.\u201d  541 \nU.S. at 767.  And the Court explained that it is neces-\nsary to look at NEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies or legisla-\ntive intent in order to draw a manageable line between \nthose causal changes that may make an actor responsi-\nble for an effect and those that do not.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nMetropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7).   \nThere is considerable overlap among these princi-\nples.  Reasonable foreseeability plays an important role \nin many statutory causation standards.  See, e.g., CSX \nTransp., Inc. v. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 703 (2011) (dis-\ncussing the role of reasonable foreseeability for deter-\nmining causation under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liabil-\nity Act, 45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.).  And Congress\u2019s recent \namendments to NEPA confirm that agencies must look \nto whether a consequence is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), in drawing the \u201cmanageable \nline\u201d that Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen con-\ntemplate, Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767.3  But the re-\n \n3  The overlap is also reflected in CEQ\u2019s 2022 amendments remov-\ning the term \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d from its NEPA \nregulations.  CEQ had added that term, drawn from the Court\u2019s \nopinions in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, for the first \ntime in 2020 to clarify that agencies may look to the attenuated na-\nture of an effect in determining the appropriate scope of their \nNEPA analyses.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343-43,344.  When CEQ \nsubsequently removed that term from the regulations in 2022, it ex-\nplained that it was not disregarding \u201can agency\u2019s ability to exclude \neffects too attenuated from its actions.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. 23, 453, 23,465 \n(Apr. 20, 2022).  Rather, CEQ indicated that the requirement of a \n \n\n24 \n \nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and causation \nare not identical.  For example, Public Citizen recog-\nnized that, even when an environmental harm is \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable\u201d in the abstract or as a factual mat-\nter, id. at 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation \nstandard is not met if the agency \u201chas no ability to pre-\nvent\u201d the harm \u201cdue to its limited statutory authority \nover the relevant actions,\u201d id. at 770.   \nIn Public Citizen, the Court considered whether an \nagency had permissibly excluded certain environmental \neffects from its NEPA analysis based on the agency\u2019s \nlimited statutory mandate.  541 U.S. at 767.  The case \ninvolved a NEPA challenge to safety regulations for \nMexican trucks that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration (FMCSA) promulgated after the Presi-\ndent decided to lift a moratorium on the entry of Mexi-\ncan trucks.  Id. at 756, 760.  The agency\u2019s NEPA analy-\nsis considered the environmental consequences of the \nroadside inspections of the Mexican trucks required by \nthe agency\u2019s new safety rules.  Id. at 761.  But the anal-\nysis did not consider the consequences of the increased \npresence of Mexican trucks in the United States be-\ncause FMCSA determined that the increased presence \nwas due to the President\u2019s decision to lift the morato-\nrium rather than the agency\u2019s new regulations.  Ibid.   \nSeveral challengers asserted that limiting the NEPA \nanalysis in that way was improper because the trucks \n \n\u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d was already captured by the \npre-2020 regulation\u2019s longstanding principle of \u201creasonable foresee-\nability,\u201d ibid., and the requirement that effects must be caused by \nthe agency.  Deleting the phrase that had been added by the 2020 \nregulations did not affect the courts\u2019 ability to consider whether \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal connection\u201d between the agency\u2019s \naction and a particular harm in reviewing whether an agency acted \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to assess that harm.     \n\n25 \n \ncould not enter the United States until the agency \npromulgated its regulations.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 765-766.  In the challengers\u2019 view, that made FMSCA \nthe \u201ccause\u200a\u201d of the entry of Mexican trucks.  Id. at 766.  \nBecause the President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium and \nthe entry of the trucks were also \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble,\u201d the challengers argued that NEPA required the \nagency to consider the environmental consequences of \nthe trucks\u2019 entry.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nThe Court rejected that argument, holding that \nNEPA does not require the \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation\u201d the challengers had proposed.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 767.  Instead, agencies may draw \ncausal lines based on \u201cthe underlying policies behind \nNEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as informed by the \u2018rule of \nreason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in the statute.  Id. at 768.  That \u201c\u200a\u2018rule \nof reason,\u2019\u200a\u201d the Court explained, \u201censures that agencies \ndetermine whether and to what extent to prepare an \n[environmental impact statement] based on the useful-\nness of any new potential information to the deci-\nsionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767.  And the \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d is not satisfied where consideration of a particular \nenvironmental harm would not serve NEPA\u2019s goals of \nproviding information to the agency to assist in its deci-\nsional process and to the public to enable it to offer \nmeaningful input.  Ibid. \nApplying those principles in Public Citizen, the \nCourt held that FMSCA could not be considered the \u201cle-\ngally relevant cause\u201d of the increased presence of Mex-\nican trucks and their attendant emissions in the United \nStates.  541 U.S. at 769.  The Court explained that \nFMSCA had no \u201cability to countermand the President\u2019s \nlifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to \nexclude Mexican motor carriers from operating within \n\n26 \n \nthe United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To the contrary, the \nCourt explained, it would \u201cviolate\u201d the agency\u2019s statu-\ntory mandate for FMCSA to refuse to authorize opera-\ntions by a Mexican motor carrier that was \u201cwilling and \nable to comply with\u201d FMCSA\u2019s safety regulations based \non concerns about the trucks\u2019 emissions, and thus to \npreclude the trucks\u2019 entry altogether.  Ibid.  In those \ncircumstances, the Court determined that FMSCA\u2019s ac-\ntions were not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of any in-\ncreased emissions from the trucks, and explained that \nrequiring the agency to consider information about any \nincrease in emissions would not satisfy NEPA\u2019s \u201crule of \nreason\u201d or its statutory purposes because the agency \nwas powerless to act on that information.  Id. at 767-769.  \n2.  Public Citizen establishes that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm might be \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d it \nmay still be excluded from an environmental impact \nstatement where the agency lacks the ability to prevent \nthe harm.  In those instances, the requisite \u201ccausal con-\nnection\u201d is missing, and the environmental harm cannot \nbe considered an \u201cimpact\u201d or \u201ceffect\u201d of the agency\u2019s ac-\ntion for purposes of NEPA.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at \n768.  That is clearly the case where, as in Public Citizen, \nthe governing statutes prohibit the agency from taking \nthe action necessary to stop the relevant harm from oc-\ncurring.  Id. at 769-770.  And it is also the case where \nthe decisions that give rise to the relevant effect are \ncommitted to the exclusive control of another agency.  \nSee Sierra Club v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. \n2016) (finding that the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission was not required \u201cto address the indirect \neffects of the anticipated export of natural gas\u201d as part \nof its NEPA analysis of the authorization of new natural \ngas facilities because \u201cthe Department of Energy, not \n\n27 \n \nthe Commission, has sole authority to license the export \nof any natural gas going through the [new] facilities\u201d) \n(emphasis omitted).4  \nBut Public Citizen\u2019s reasoning indicates that an \nagency may also find that the requisite causal connec-\ntion is absent or diminished where the scope of the \nagency action and the nature and requirements of the \ngoverning statutes render a particular harm too atten-\nuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise insuffi-\nciently material to the agency decision under consider-\nation.  Where an agency makes such a reasonable,  \ncontext-specific determination, the agency is entitled to \n\u201cdraw a manageable line\u201d that excludes any considera-\ntion of harms where a \u201creasonably close causal connec-\ntion\u201d is absent, or that appropriately limits the analysis \nof harms where the causal connection is simply less ro-\nbust.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citations omitted).  \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cunderlying policies\u201d are not served by addi-\ntional analysis of a harm that is too attenuated, specu-\nlative, or contingent to influence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking or to provide \u201c\u200a\u2018a springboard\u2019\u200a\u201d for mean-\ningful public comments.  Id. at 768 (citation omitted).  \nAnd it would not \u201csatisfy NEPA\u2019s \u2018rule of reason\u2019 to re-\n \n4  In their certiorari-stage briefing, petitioners asserted (Pet. 24-\n25) that CEQ\u2019s recent amendments to its NEPA regulations have \ninappropriately narrowed the scope of Public Citizen by disregard-\ning the proposition that an agency may exclude environmental ef-\nfects that it has no power to prevent.  In fact, in the preamble to its \n2022 revisions to the NEPA regulations, CEQ merely explained that \nthe Court\u2019s description of the causation issue in Public Citizen was \nnecessarily informed by the particular context of the case, in which \nthe agency was affirmatively barred by statute from acting on the \nbasis of the alleged environmental harm.  CEQ\u2019s discussion was not \nintended to place limits on an agency\u2019s discretion beyond those im-\nposed by the statute itself.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 23,464-23,465.   \n\n28 \n \nquire an agency to\u201d analyze a harm when it has con-\ncluded that the harm is too far afield from the agency\u2019s \naction to make \u201cany new potential information\u201d useful \nto the agency\u2019s \u201cdecisionmaking process.\u201d  Id. at 767, \n769.   \n3.  This Court\u2019s cases regarding the standard of judi-\ncial review of the scope of an environmental impact \nstatement further establish that agencies are afforded \nconsiderable latitude and discretion in determining the \nbounds of their NEPA analyses based on these consid-\nerations.  The Court has repeatedly recognized that an \nagency\u2019s decision about whether and how to prepare an \nenvironmental impact statement \u201ccan be set aside only \nupon a showing that it was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.\u2019\u200a\u201d Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 763 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n706(2)(A)); see, e.g., Marsh, 490 U.S. at 375.  The Court \nhas also stressed that a reviewing court should not treat \nan agency\u2019s factual determination regarding whether \nan environmental effect requires additional analysis as \na \u201clegal question\u201d subject to searching review.  Marsh, \n490 U.S. at 376.  A \u201ccourt need only decide whether the \nagency decision was \u2018arbitrary and capricious.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at \n375.  And under that standard, a court should not reject \nan agency\u2019s decision unless the agency has made a \n\u201c\u200a\u2018clear error of judgment,\u2019\u200a\u201d even if the court believes \nthat \u201canother decisionmaker might have reached a con-\ntrary result.\u201d  Id. at 385.   \nIn Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390 (1976), for ex-\nample, the Court held that \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbi-\ntrary action,\u201d a reviewing court \u201cmust assume\u201d that the \nagency has \u201cexercised [its] discretion appropriately\u201d in \ndeciding the scope of its environmental impact state-\nment.  Id. at 412.  In considering the environmental im-\n\n29 \n \npacts at issue in that case, including the \u201c[d]iminished \navailability of water, air and water pollution, increases \nin population and industrial densities, and perhaps even \nclimatic changes,\u201d the Court held that the \u201cdetermina-\ntion of the extent and effect of these factors, and partic-\nularly identification of the geographic area within which \nthey may occur, is a task assigned to the special compe-\ntency of the appropriate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 413-414.  The \nCourt therefore recognized that the proper scope of a \nNEPA analysis calls for a context-specific determina-\ntion that depends on the nature of the decision before \nthe agency and its assessment of the facts on the \nground.    \n4. CEQ\u2019s current regulations reinforce the principle \nthat an agency may reasonably determine the scope of \nits NEPA analysis by assessing the extent to which en-\nvironmental harms may be too attenuated, speculative, \nor otherwise insufficiently material to inform the agen-\ncy\u2019s decisionmaking and to assist the public in providing \nmeaningful input into that decisionmaking.  \nCEQ regulations provide that an agency must con-\nsider the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindirect,\u201d \nand \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of its actions, and the defini-\ntions of those terms make clear that agencies cannot ar-\nbitrarily limit their analysis based on rigid measures of \ngeographic distance, timing, or the number of other \ncontributors to the effect.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (capitali-\nzation omitted).5  But the regulations also expressly \n \n5  In preparing the environmental impact statement in this case, \nthe Board applied CEQ\u2019s pre-2020 regulations, Pet. App. 26a, which \nare substantially similar to the current regulations.  In 2020, CEQ \namended its regulations to eliminate the distinction among cumula-\ntive, indirect, and direct effects.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 43,343.  But in \n \n\n30 \n \ncontemplate that agencies will engage in a \u201cscoping\u201d \nprocess at the outset of any environmental review to en-\nsure that the agency focuses its attention on the effects \nthat are most important to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking \nwith respect to the project at hand.  See 40 C.F.R. \n1501.3(b), 1501.9(b), 1502.4.  As part of the scoping pro-\ncess, the agency is required to \u201cidentify[] the important \nissues and eliminat[e] from further study unimportant \nissues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues that \u201chave \nbeen covered by prior environmental review(s),\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  Similarly, CEQ\u2019s regulations \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d \nproviding \u201conly brief discussion of other than important \nissues.\u201d  40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b).  And the regulations pro-\nvide that the length of environmental impact statements \n\u201cshould be proportional to potential environmental ef-\nfects and the scope and complexity of the action.\u201d   \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(c). \n*  *  *  *  * \nIn short, NEPA and its implementing regulations, as \nwell as this Court\u2019s NEPA precedents, establish that an \nagency is not required to consider every environmental \nharm that the agency can reasonably foresee.  Rather, \nthe agency may draw a manageable causal line that ex-\ncludes the harms that the agency lacks the statutory au-\nthority to prevent, and that takes account of whether \nand to what extent particular harms are too attenuated, \nspeculative, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking to serve NEPA\u2019s purposes and \nsatisfy its rule of reason, given the scope and nature of \nthe agency action and the governing statutes.      \n \n2022, CEQ reestablished those longstanding categories.  See 87 \nFed. Reg. at 23,462-23,463.   \n\n31 \n \nB. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Suggest That An \nAgency May Impose Limits On Its Environmental Anal-\nysis That Do Not Comport With NEPA\u2019s Text Or Under-\nlying Policies \nAlthough NEPA and its implementing regulations \npermit an agency to refrain from analyzing environ-\nmental effects under the principles described above, an \nagency may not impose limits on the scope of its analy-\nsis that conflict with the statutory text or \u201cthe underly-\ning policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent.\u201d  Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768.  In their certiorari-stage \nbriefing, petitioners appeared to endorse three such un-\nsupported, extra-textual limits:  (1) that agencies may \nrestrict their analysis to the effects they directly regu-\nlate, rather than relying on the nature of their statutory \nauthority to inform a context-specific inquiry regarding \nthe appropriate scope of the agency\u2019s environmental im-\npact statement; (2) that agencies should base their anal-\nysis of causation on substantive standards from tort \nlaw, rather than treating the \u201c\u200a\u2018familiar doctrine of prox-\nimate cause from tort law\u2019\u200a\u201d as an \u201canalog[y]\u201d and look-\ning to NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and rule of reason in \ndrawing their causal lines, id. at 767 (citation omitted); \nand (3) that agencies may eschew the context-specific \ninquiry NEPA requires in favor of broad and bright-line \nrules based on geography, timing, or the specific num-\nber of contributors to the particular harm.  Each of \nthose arguments lacks merit. \n1. At the certiorari stage, petitioners repeatedly as-\nserted that \u201cagencies need not study environmental ef-\nfects that they do not regulate.\u201d  Pet. 14 (emphasis omit-\nted); see, e.g., Pet. 4, 21.  To the extent petitioners mean \nto suggest that agencies are not required to consider ef-\nfects if they have no statutory power to prevent those \n\n32 \n \neffects, that is nothing more than a restatement of Pub-\nlic Citizen\u2019s holding.  But if petitioners instead mean \nthat agencies never have to consider environmental ef-\nfects they do not directly regulate\u2014that is, that they \nmay ignore effects they are not expressly charged with \noverseeing under their organic statutes\u2014then petition-\ners\u2019 argument is contradicted by NEPA\u2019s text.   \nNEPA contains an express requirement that agen-\ncies \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments of any \nFederal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special \nexpertise with respect to any environmental impact in-\nvolved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  That provision tells an agency what it \nshould do when the environmental consequences of its \nproposed action implicate another agency\u2019s regulatory \njurisdiction, rather than (or in addition to) its own.  The \nagency preparing the environmental impact statement \nmust \u201cconsult\u201d with the other agency, 42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C), and it may also make the other agency a \u201cco-\noperating agency,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3).  Moreover, if \nthe other agency has analyzed or will analyze the effect, \nthat analysis can be incorporated by reference, thereby \navoiding inefficiencies.  See 40 C.F.R. 1501.2, 1502.4(d)(1).  \nWhat the agency may not do is disregard an effect en-\ntirely based solely on the fact that another agency has \nmore direct \u201cjurisdiction by law\u201d over the effect.  42 \nU.S.C. 4336a(a)(3). \nMoreover, confining agencies\u2019 NEPA obligations to \nthe consideration of environmental effects they already \ndirectly regulate would contravene Congress\u2019s com-\n\n33 \n \nmand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Government\u201d \nshall \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d comply with the ob-\nligation to prepare an environmental impact statement \nin connection with their major actions that have signifi-\ncant environmental effects.  42 U.S.C. 4332 (emphasis \nadded).  If agencies were to exclude environmental ef-\nfects that are not within their direct regulatory jurisdic-\ntion, the many federal agencies that have no direct ju-\nrisdiction over environmental issues under their or-\nganic statutes would have no NEPA obligations at all, \nand the obligations of other agencies would shrink dras-\ntically.  That is the opposite of what Congress required.  \nInterpreting NEPA to permit agencies to ignore any \neffect they do not directly regulate would also render \nthe statute\u2019s procedural commands largely nugatory.  \nNEPA was enacted to ensure that agencies \u201cwill have \navailable, and will carefully consider, detailed infor-\nmation concerning significant environmental impacts.\u201d  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768 (citation omitted).  If the \nagency already directly regulates the environmental ef-\nfects in question, it does not need NEPA to ensure that \nit has relevant information in front of it.  That cannot be \nwhat Congress intended when it enacted its landmark \nstatute establishing a \u201cnational policy [to] encourage \nproductive and enjoyable harmony between man and \nhis environment,\u201d and to promote better environmental \ndecisionmaking while enriching the understanding of \nthe Nation\u2019s important natural resources.  42 U.S.C. \n4321.6    \n \n6  See Comm. on Interior and Insular Affairs, National Environ-\nmental Policy Act of 1969, S. Rep. No. 296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 8 \n(1969) (Senate Report) (noting \u201crising public concern over the man-\nner in which Federal policies and activities have contributed to en-\n \n\n34 \n \n2. a. Petitioners also repeatedly suggest (e.g., Pet. \n4, 16, 23) that NEPA requires the application of the \nsame proximate cause standards from tort law.  Again, \npetitioners are correct to the extent they merely mean \nto assert that NEPA does not require an agency to as-\nsess all effects under a standard of \u201cbut-for\u201d causation \nand instead permits agencies to exclude harms for \nwhich their actions are not the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d; \nindeed, that is simply a restatement of the Court\u2019s hold-\nings in Public Citizen.  541 U.S. at 767, 769.  But recog-\nnizing that the agency\u2019s action must be the \u201clegally rel-\nevant cause\u201d of an environmental harm does not equate \nto a holding that NEPA incorporates the same proxi-\nmate cause standards from tort law or require agencies \nto turn to tort law as the basis of analysis.   \nTo the contrary, this Court has expressly rejected \nthe proposition that \u201cany cause-effect relation too at-\ntenuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be \ntoo attenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental im-\npact statement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Thus, while both Metropolitan Edison and Public \nCitizen \u201canalogized\u201d NEPA\u2019s requirement of a \u201creason-\nably close causal relationship\u201d to \u201cthe \u2018familiar doctrine \n \nvironmental decay and degradation,\u201d and citing examples such as \n\u201cthe Santa Barbara oil well blowout,\u201d \u201cthe proliferation of pesticides \nand other chemicals,\u201d \u201cthe indiscriminate siting of  * * *  heavy in-\ndustry,\u201d \u201cthe pollution of the Nation\u2019s rivers, bays, lakes, and estu-\naries,\u201d \u201cthe loss of publicly owned  * * *  open spaces  * * *  to indus-\ntry, commercial users, and developers,\u201d and \u201crising levels of air pol-\nlution.\u201d); see id. at 4 (discussing \u201c[t]he inadequacy of present know-\nledge, policies, and institutions,\u201d as reflected in problems such as \n\u201ccritical air and water pollution problems,\u201d \u201cdiminishing recreational \nopportunity,\u201d \u201crising levels of noise,\u201d \u201can increasingly ugly landscape \ncluttered with billboards, powerlines, and junkyards,\u201d and \u201cmany, \nmany other environmental quality problems\u201d). \n\n35 \n \nof proximate cause from tort law,\u2019\u200a\u201d the comparison was \nintended to illustrate that NEPA causation turns on the \nresponsibility of the federal agency; it was not intended \nto suggest that tort law itself should be used to define \nthe scope of an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Public Citi-\nzen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation omitted).  Rather, in draw-\ning causal lines in the two cases, the Court looked to the \n\u201cunderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 in-\ntent.\u201d  Id. at 768. \nThat is readily apparent in Public Citizen, where the \nCourt relied on an analysis of NEPA\u2019s purposes and its \n\u201crule of reason\u201d in concluding that the agency did not \nneed to consider the effects of the increased presence of \nMexican trucks in the United States.  541 U.S. 767; see \npp. 24-25, supra.  But it is equally true of Metropolitan \nEdison.  In that case, the Court looked to NEPA\u2019s un-\nderlying purposes to determine whether the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission was required to consider the \npsychological harms caused by the fear of nuclear acci-\ndents before authorizing a nuclear power plant to re-\nsume operations.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at \n770-771.  The Court determined that the agency was not \nrequired to consider those harms because NEPA\u2019s \n\u201ccentral concern\u201d is whether a project\u2019s \u201cgains are \nworth a given level of alteration of our physical environ-\nment or depletion of our natural resources,\u201d not \nwhether a project\u2019s gains are \u201cworth its attendant \nrisks.\u201d  Id. at 775-776.  The causal analysis was there-\nfore focused on the extent to which the effect in question \nwas one that Congress would have intended to cover.   \nb. Further, NEPA is distinct from the federal stat-\nutes that this Court has held incorporate a proximate \ncause standard borrowed from tort law.  Those statutes \ntypically permit the award of damages against private \n\n36 \n \nparties found liable for specific harms, making the anal-\nogy to the common law of torts relatively close.  See, \ne.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n201 (2017) (Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., \ndamages suit); Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014) (damages \nunder the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).  By con-\ntrast, NEPA does not allocate responsibility for a par-\nticular harm or impose monetary damages.  Instead, \nNEPA seeks to \u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d \nharms by ensuring that federal agencies consider the \nenvironmental consequences of their actions.  Public \nCitizen, 541 U.S. at 756 (citation omitted).  There is no \nreason to think that, in enacting a statute designed to \n\u201creduce or eliminate environmental\u201d harm, Congress \nintended to draw the same causal lines that the tort sys-\ntem uses to allocate blame among private parties for \nharms that have already occurred.  Nor is it plausible \nthat, in imposing NEPA\u2019s purely \u201cprocedural require-\nments,\u201d ibid., Congress intended to require the precise \nkind of causal connection that is necessary to justify \nmonetary damages.    \nc. Simply engrafting the same proximate cause \nstandard from tort law onto NEPA would also introduce \nunnecessary confusion into the statutory scheme.  \n\u201c\u200a\u2018[P]roximate cause\u2019\u200a\u201d is a term that has been used to \nrefer to a variety of different things, including \u201cthe \u2018im-\nmediate\u2019 or \u2018nearest\u2019 antecedent test; the \u2018efficient, pro-\nducing cause\u2019 test; the \u2018substantial factor\u2019 test; and the \n\u2018probable,\u2019 or \u2018natural and probable,\u2019 or \u2018foreseeable\u2019 \nconsequence test.\u201d  CSX Transp., 564 U.S. at 701.  \nAgencies and courts attempting to make sense of the \nterm would be likely to come to diverging results about \nwhat must be included in an environmental impact \n\n37 \n \nstatement.  And that is all the more likely because the \nCourt has emphasized that, even when a federal statute \nincorporates tort principles of proximate cause, the con-\ntours of the analysis must nonetheless be drawn to re-\nflect \u201cthe nature of the statutory cause of action.\u201d  Bank \nof Am. Corp., 581 U.S.  at 201; see id. at 203 (remanding \nto the court of appeals to draw the \u201cprecise boundaries \nof proximate cause under the\u201d Fair Housing Act).  Ac-\ncordingly, if the Court were to conclude that NEPA in-\ncorporates tort law governing proximate cause, that ap-\nproach would still raise questions about what exactly \nthe standard means in this context.     \n3. It would be similarly erroneous to impose rigid \nbright-line rules that woodenly exclude harms based \nsolely on their geographic or temporal distance from \nthe agency action or based on the number of intervening \nsteps or the number of entities contributing to the \nharm.  As explained, see pp. 27-30, supra, an agency \nmay make a context-specific determination that, given \nthe nature of the proposed action and the governing \nstatutes, a particular harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking.  But that does not mean \nthat an agency can refuse to consider effects for which \nits actions are the legally relevant cause and which \nwould inform the agency\u2019s decisionmaking merely be-\ncause those effects are geographically or temporally re-\nmoved or because other entities also play a role in \nbringing them about.   \nIndeed, many significant environmental harms\u2014in-\ncluding some of the very effects that prompted NEPA\u2019s \nenactment, like water contamination and smog\u2014are \ncaused by many parties that are geographically and \ntemporally removed from the location where the harm \n\n38 \n \nis most keenly felt.  Senate Report 8.  If agencies wood-\nenly applied bright-line rules based on geography, tim-\ning, or the specific number of other contributing actors, \nsome of these significant effects might be disregarded \nentirely by agencies whose actions make material con-\ntributions to the harms.   \n4. All of these arguments seemingly boil down to a \nrequest to impose new limits on NEPA\u2019s established \nframework.  The proper branch of government to ad-\ndress such requests is Congress.  And in this case, the \nrequest is particularly misplaced because Congress it-\nself recently amended NEPA without overriding this \nCourt\u2019s precedents or making any of the changes that \npetitioners now seek from this Court.   \nMoreover, many of Congress\u2019s recent amendments \nwere intended to address the process of developing an \nenvironmental impact statement.  In addition to codify-\ning the reasonable foreseeability requirement, 42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i), Congress adopted new timing re-\nquirements and page limits, as well as new procedures \nfor inter-agency cooperation, see 42 U.S.C. 4336a.  Con-\ngress also made alterations to the conditions under \nwhich environmental impact statements are required, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. 4336, and established a set of new statu-\ntory definitions, including a new definition of the \u201cmajor \nFederal action[s]\u201d to which NEPA applies, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. 4336e(10).  Nor is this list comprehensive.  But \nCongress did not choose to make any changes that \nwould dramatically limit NEPA\u2019s reach in the way peti-\ntioners appear to advocate.     \n\n39 \n \nC. The Board Reasonably Declined To Perform Additional \nAnalysis Of The Upstream And Downstream Effects Of \nOil And Gas Development \nThe court of appeals also erred in interpreting and \napplying NEPA\u2019s statutory requirements.  The court \nheld that the agency was required to perform additional \nand more detailed analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development because the \neffects were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d and the Board\u2019s \nstatutory authority was broad enough to permit their \nconsideration.  Pet. App. 30a-37a.  But the court failed \nto recognize that, even in those circumstances, an agen-\ncy may decline to perform additional analysis when it \nreasonably determines that the harms in question are \ntoo attenuated, speculative, contingent, or otherwise in-\nsufficiently material to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in \nlight of the nature of the proposed action and the stat-\nutes under which the agency is operating.  The Board \nmade such a reasonable determination here. \n1. As a threshold matter, the certiorari-stage brief-\ning has narrowed the scope of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision that is properly before this Court.  In their certi-\norari petition, petitioners focused their challenge exclu-\nsively on the court of appeals\u2019 assertedly erroneous in-\nterpretation of the NEPA causation standard articu-\nlated in Public Citizen.  See Pet. i.  Petitioners did not \nallege legal errors with respect to any other aspects of \nthe court\u2019s decision.  They did not challenge any of the \ncourt\u2019s findings that the Board erred in applying stat-\nutes other than NEPA.  And they did not focus their \nchallenge on aspects of the court\u2019s application of NEPA \nbeyond the court\u2019s determination that the Board could \nnot rely on Public Citizen to justify limiting its consid-\neration of the upstream and downstream effects of oil \n\n40 \n \nand gas development in its environmental impact state-\nment.  Pet. App. 36a-39a.   \nMoreover, in challenging the court of appeals\u2019 deter-\nmination that the Board\u2019s treatment of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development was \ninadequate, petitioners did not address the court\u2019s find-\ning that the effects were reasonably foreseeable.  And \npetitioners appeared to concede that the Board has the \npower to deny an exemption based on environmental ef-\nfects that it concludes are material to its decision.  See \nPet. 23.     \nWhen respondents described the limited nature of \npetitioners\u2019 challenge in their briefs in opposition (e.g., \nGov\u2019t Br. in Opp. 17-18), petitioners briefly asserted \n(Cert. Reply Br. 10) that they had somehow preserved \nan argument regarding the validity of the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 application of NEPA to certain \u201cdownline im-\npacts\u201d and that a ruling on their behalf would \u201cvindicate \nevery part of the Board\u2019s NEPA review.\u201d  But the only \ncitations to the petition that they offered in support \nwere to descriptions of the facts in the background sec-\ntion.  See id. at 9-10 (citing Pet. 10, 12).  And petitioners \nagain failed to contest (id. at 11) the court\u2019s determina-\ntion that the oil and gas development effects were \u201crea-\nsonably foreseeable,\u201d while expressly conceding (ibid.) \nthat \u201cthe Board has authority to weigh environmental \neffects in its decisions.\u201d   \nAccordingly, the only aspect of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that is properly before this Court is the holding \nthat Public Citizen did not permit the Board to forgo \nadditional and more detailed analysis of the upstream \nand downstream consequences of oil and gas develop-\nment in its environmental impact statement.    \n\n41 \n \n2. The court of appeals\u2019 decision on that issue was \nincorrect.  The court of appeals concluded that the up-\nstream and downstream consequences of oil and gas de-\nvelopment were reasonably foreseeable and that the \nBoard\u2019s organic statutes afforded it the authority to \nprevent those consequences from occurring by refusing \nto authorize the new railroad line.7  Even assuming \nthose conclusions were correct, the Board did not act \narbitrarily and capriciously in declining to conduct fur-\nther analysis of the consequences in its environmental \nimpact statement.  Rather, the Board reasonably deter-\nmined that, based on the scope of the proposed action \nand the provisions of the Board\u2019s governing statutes, \nthe upstream and downstream consequences of oil and \ngas development were too attenuated, speculative, and \notherwise insufficiently material to the Board\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking to require additional consideration under \nNEPA.  Because the statute permits agencies to draw \nsuch a manageable causal line, the court of appeals \nerred in setting aside this aspect of the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion.   \na. To begin, this is not a case in which the agency \nfailed to identify potentially relevant effects, omitting \nthem from its environmental impact statement alto-\ngether.  To the contrary, the Board spent over 50 pages \nof its final environmental impact statement and its final \ndecision on the rail project discussing the environmen-\ntal consequences that might result from new oil and gas \ndrilling and refining occurring after completion of the \nrailway line.  Those discussions included both a qualita-\ntive analysis of the potential for new oil and gas devel-\n \n7  In its briefing before the court of appeals, the Board argued that \nneither conclusion was correct, but as explained, petitioners did not \nseek certiorari on those issues.  \n\n42 \n \nopment in the Basin, and quantitative estimates that the \nBoard found were likely to exaggerate the aggregate \namount of new crude oil that might be transported to \nrefineries and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 351-362, 365-474.   \nThe discussions also included detailed explanations \nof why additional environmental analysis was not nec-\nessary.  See J.A. 421, 477-482, 520-529; Pet. App. 107a-\n109a.  The Board did not rely on bright-line rules to ar-\nbitrarily exclude environmental information that might \nhave been useful to the agency in its decisionmaking \nprocess or to the public in commenting during the pro-\ncess.  Instead, the Board explained the various context-\nspecific factors that prompted it to conclude that addi-\ntional analysis of the upstream and downstream conse-\nquences of oil and gas development would not \u201cinform\u201d \nits decisionmaking.  J.A. 521; see J.A. 520-529.   \nSpecifically, the Board relied on its governing stat-\nutes to determine the appropriate scope of the agency \naction before it.  J.A. 522; see J.A. 421.  The Board ex-\nplained that it \u201chas jurisdiction over rail transportation \nby rail carriers,\u201d citing 49 U.S.C. 10501 and 49 U.S.C. \n10502\u2019s mandate to grant exemptions based on the \ntransportation merits of a particular project.  J.A. 522.  \nThe Board also cited the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s \ncommon-carrier mandate, under which \u201crailroads have \na common carrier obligation to carry all commodities, \nincluding hazardous materials, upon reasonable request \nunder 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101,\u201d explaining that it \u201ctherefore \ncannot restrict the types of products and commodities \nthat are transported on rail lines.\u201d  J.A. 421.  And the \nBoard observed that oil and gas development was \u201csub-\n\n43 \n \nject to the approval processes of other federal, state, lo-\ncal, and tribal agencies.\u201d  J.A. 522.8 \nBased on this statutory framework, the Board found \nthat it \u201clack[ed] sufficient control over future oil and gas \ndevelopment projects to make those projects part of the \nproposed action assessed in the [environmental impact \nstatement].\u201d  J.A. 523.  Further, drawing on the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act\u2019s common-carrier mandate, the \nBoard explained that\u2014while petitioners had proposed \nthe new railroad line to fill a need for better transpor-\ntation for crude oil\u2014petitioners\u2019 request for Board au-\nthorization was properly understood as a request to \nprovide \u201ccommon carrier rail service connecting the Ba-\nsin to the interstate common carrier rail network,\u201d ra-\nther than a request to approve new oil and gas develop-\nment.  J.A. 527.  \nIn addition, the Board listed a number of factors that \nled it to conclude that the environmental harms from \nany \u201cpotential future\u201d oil and gas development were too \nspeculative and attenuated from the proposed action of \nauthorizing the new railroad line to warrant more de-\ntailed consideration in the environmental impact state-\nment.  J.A. 527; see J.A. 527-528.  The Board observed, \nfor example, that any future oil and gas development in \nthe Basin would involve \u201cmany separate and independ-\n \n8  For instance, the Bureau of Land Management administers pub-\nlic lands in the Uinta Basin on which some of the oil and gas produc-\ntion would take place, and the Bureau has conducted NEPA analysis \nof the effects of various proposed oil and gas exploration and pro-\nduction projects in the Basin.  See Rocky Mountain Wild v. Bern-\nhardt, 506 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1177-1185 (D. Utah 2020); Southern \nUtah Wilderness All. v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Interior, No. 13-\ncv-1060, 2016 WL 6909036, at *3-*13 (D. Utah Oct. 3, 2016); \nWildEarth Guardians v. United States Forest Serv., No. 14-cv-349, \n2021 WL 409827 (D. Utah Feb. 5, 2012). \n\n44 \n \nent projects that have not yet been proposed or \nplanned,\u201d and that might vary according to the land on \nwhich they are situated and the scale of the drilling op-\nerations.  JA. 528.  The Board also found that, while it \n\u201cis possible that\u201d increased oil production could lead to \nincreased oil refining by the Salt Lake City refineries \nthat currently accept Uinta Basin crude oil, that refin-\ning might increase regardless of the Board\u2019s actions \n\u201cdepend[ing] on future market conditions.\u201d  Ibid.  The \nBoard separately explained that it anticipated that most \noil would be shipped to refineries on the Gulf Coast and \nPuget Sound, but it noted that \u201c[t]he final destinations \nof the trains would depend on the ability and willingness \nof refineries in other markets to receive rail cars carry-\ning Uinta Basin crude oil and process the oil in their re-\nfineries.\u201d  J.A. 477.  \nFurther, in its final decision authorizing construction \nof the new line, the Board reiterated its determinations \nregarding the scope of the proposed action, the limits of \nthe Board\u2019s authority, and the attenuated and specula-\ntive nature of the harms from oil and gas development \nand refining.  Pet. App. 105a-108a.  The Board repeated \nthat it was authorizing the construction of a new rail-\nroad line and that the Board lacked the \u201cauthority to \ncontrol or mitigate\u201d oil and gas development.  Id. at \n108a.  And the Board also repeated its finding that any \nnew oil and gas development in the Basin that \u201cmay oc-\ncur following authorization of [the new railroad line] \nwould entail many separate and independent projects \nthat have not yet been proposed or planned and that \ncould occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land and \ncould range in scale from a single vertical oil well to a \nlarge lease.\u201d  Ibid.  The Board also found that \u201cthe ac-\ntual volumes of crude oil that would move over the [new \n\n45 \n \nline] would depend on various independent variables \nand influences, including general domestic and global \neconomic conditions, commodity pricing, the strategic \nand capital investment decisions of oil producers, and \nfuture market demand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. \nat 106a.   \nb. The Board thus relied on the scope of the agency \naction and the Interstate Commerce Act\u2019s relevant stat-\nutory provisions to come to the reasonable conclusion \nthat it was appropriate to forgo additional or more de-\ntailed analysis of harms that the Board found too atten-\nuated and speculative to inform its decisionmaking.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.  That determination \naccords with the principles of causation articulated in \nPublic Citizen, as well as longstanding NEPA prece-\ndents and CEQ regulations, all of which establish that \nan agency has the discretion to make context-specific \ndeterminations regarding the scope of its environmen-\ntal impact statement.  The court of appeals therefore \nhad no basis for finding that the Board\u2019s determination \nwas arbitrary and capricious or otherwise contrary to \napplicable law.   \nAccordingly, the portion of the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision holding that the Board erred in declining to un-\ndertake additional analysis of the upstream and down-\nstream effects of oil and gas development should be re-\nversed.   \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed in relevant part, and the case should be re-\nmanded to the court of appeals for further proceedings \nconsistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \nANIKA SANDERS COOPER \nGeneral Counsel \nBARBARA MILLER \nAttorney \nSurface Transportation \nBoard  \n \nELIZABETH B.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, \nthe remedies provided under this part with respect to \nregulation of rail transportation are exclusive and \npreempt the remedies provided under Federal or State \nlaw. \n(c)(1)  In this subsection\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe term \u201clocal governmental authority\u201d\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhas the same meaning given that term by \nsection 5302 of this title; and \n \n(ii) \nincludes a person or entity that contracts \nwith the local governmental authority to provide \ntransportation services; and \n\n9a \n \n \n(B) \nthe term \u201cpublic transportation\u201d means \ntransportation services described in section 5302 of \nthis title that are provided by rail. \n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Board \ndoes not have jurisdiction under this part over\u2014 \n \n(A) \npublic transportation provided by a local \ngovernment authority; or \n \n(B) \na solid waste rail transfer facility as defined \nin section 10908 of this title, except as provided under \nsections 10908 and 10909 of this title. \n(3)(A)  Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this sub-\nsection, a local governmental authority, described in \nparagraph (2), is subject to applicable laws of the United \nStates related to\u2014 \n \n(i) \nsafety; \n \n(ii) \nthe representation of employees for collec-\ntive bargaining; and \n \n(iii) \nemployment, retirement, annuity, and un-\nemployment systems or other provisions related to \ndealings between employees and employers. \n(B) The Board has jurisdiction under sections 11102 \nand 11103 of this title over transportation provided by a \nlocal governmental authority only if the Board finds that \nsuch governmental authority meets all of the standards \nand requirements for being a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Inter-\nstate Commerce Commission that were in effect imme-\ndiately before January 1, 1996.  The enactment of the \nICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor \ncontract coverage of employees and employers by the \nRailway Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of \n\n10a \n \n1974, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad \nUnemployment Insurance Act. \n \n4. \n49 U.S.C. 10502 provides: \nAuthority to exempt rail carrier transportation \n(a) In a matter related to a rail carrier providing \ntransportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board \nunder this part, the Board, to the maximum extent con-\nsistent with this part, shall exempt a person, class of \npersons, or a transaction or service whenever the Board \nfinds that the application in whole or in part of a provi-\nsion of this part\u2014 \n \n(1) \nis not necessary to carry out the transporta-\ntion policy of section 10101 of this title; and \n \n(2) \neither\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe transaction or service is of limited \nscope; or \n \n(B) \nthe application in whole or in part of the \nprovision is not needed to protect shippers from \nthe abuse of market power. \n(b) The Board may, where appropriate, begin a pro-\nceeding under this section on its own initiative or on ap-\nplication by the Secretary of Transportation or an inter-\nested party.  The Board shall, within 90 days after re-\nceipt of any such application, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.  If the Board decides \nnot to begin a class exemption proceeding, the reasons \nfor the decision shall be published in the Federal Regis-\nter.  Any proceeding begun as a result of an application \n\n11a \n \nunder this subsection shall be completed within 9 \nmonths after it is begun. \n(c) The Board may specify the period of time during \nwhich an exemption granted under this section is effec-\ntive. \n(d) The Board may revoke an exemption, to the ex-\ntent it specifies, when it finds that application in whole \nor in part of a provision of this part to the person, class, \nor transportation is necessary to carry out the transpor-\ntation policy of section 10101 of this title.  The Board \nshall, within 90 days after receipt of a request for revo-\ncation under this subsection, determine whether to \nbegin an appropriate proceeding.  If the Board decides \nnot to begin a proceeding to revoke a class exemption, \nthe reasons for the decision shall be published in the \nFederal Register.  Any proceeding begun as a result of \na request under this subsection shall be completed \nwithin 9 months after it is begun. \n(e) No exemption order issued pursuant to this sec-\ntion shall operate to relieve any rail carrier from an ob-\nligation to provide contractual terms for liability and \nclaims which are consistent with the provisions of sec-\ntion 11706 of this title.  Nothing in this subsection or \nsection 11706 of this title shall prevent rail carriers from \noffering alternative terms nor give the Board the au-\nthority to require any specific level of rates or services \nbased upon the provisions of section 11706 of this title. \n(f\u200a) The Board may exercise its authority under this \nsection to exempt transportation that is provided by a \nrail carrier as part of a continuous intermodal move-\nment. \n\n12a \n \n(g) The Board may not exercise its authority under \nthis section to relieve a rail carrier of its obligation to \nprotect the interests of employees as required by this \npart. \n \n5. \n49 U.S.C. 10901 provides: \nAuthorizing construction and operation of railroad lines \n(a) A person may\u2014 \n \n(1) construct an extension to any of its railroad \nlines; \n \n(2) construct an additional railroad line; \n \n(3) provide transportation over, or by means of, \nan extended or additional railroad line; or \n \n(4) in the case of a person other than a rail car-\nrier, acquire a railroad line or acquire or operate an \nextended or additional railroad line, \nonly if the Board issues a certificate authorizing such ac-\ntivity under subsection (c). \n(b) A proceeding to grant authority under subsec-\ntion (a) of this section begins when an application is filed.  \nOn receiving the application, the Board shall give rea-\nsonable public notice, including notice to the Governor \nof any affected State, of the beginning of such proceed-\ning. \n(c) The Board shall issue a certificate authorizing \nactivities for which such authority is requested in an ap-\nplication filed under subsection (b) unless the Board \nfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the public \nconvenience and necessity.  Such certificate may ap-\n\n13a \n \nprove the application as filed, or with modifications, and \nmay require compliance with conditions (other than la-\nbor protection conditions) the Board finds necessary in \nthe public interest. \n(d)(1)  When a certificate has been issued by the \nBoard under this section authorizing the construction or \nextension of a railroad line, no other rail carrier may \nblock any construction or extension authorized by such \ncertificate by refusing to permit the carrier to cross its \nproperty if\u2014 \n \n(A) \nthe construction does not unreasonably in-\nterfere with the operation of the crossed line; \n \n(B) \nthe operation does not materially interfere \nwith the operation of the crossed line; and \n \n(C) \nthe owner of the crossing line compensates \nthe owner of the crossed line. \n(2) If the parties are unable to agree on the terms of \noperation or the amount of payment for purposes of par-\nagraph (1) of this subsection, either party may submit \nthe matters in dispute to the Board for determination.  \nThe Board shall make a determination under this para-\ngraph within 120 days after the dispute is submitted for \ndetermination. \n \n6. \n49 U.S.C. 11101(a) provides: \nCommon carrier transportation, service, and rates \n(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part \nshall provide the transportation or service on reasona-\nble request.  A rail carrier shall not be found to have \n\n14a \n \nviolated this section because it fulfills its reasonable \ncommitments under contracts authorized under section \n10709 of this title before responding to reasonable re-\nquests for service.  Commitments which deprive a car-\nrier of its ability to respond to reasonable requests for \ncommon carrier service are not reasonable.",

It served to confirm and highlight a critical gap in my knowledge that was identified in the previous update.\n\nMy understanding of the case is therefore unchanged from the last update. It is anchored in the three competing legal frameworks: the petitioners' \"proximate cause\" test, the respondents' \"reasonable foreseeability\" test, and the Solicitor General's \"rule of reason\" framework.\n\nThe discovery of the State of Utah's amicus brief in support of the petitioners remains the most significant recent development. This brief substantially strengthened the petitioners' position by:\n1.  **Injecting a potent federalism argument:** It frames the D.C. Circuit's ruling as federal overreach that infringes on Utah's sovereign authority to manage its own environment and economy. This argument is likely to appeal to the Court's conservative wing.\n2.  **Providing strong policy justifications:** It details the project's economic benefits for struggling counties and its environmental/safety advantages (less GHG emissions and truck traffic compared to road transport).\n3.  **Reinforcing the \"rule of reason\":** By showcasing Utah's own regulatory capacity, the brief provides a concrete example of why an agency like the STB should be granted deference to set reasonable boundaries for its NEPA analysis, making the SG's proposed middle-ground solution more attractive.\n\nThis observation explicitly confirms that my knowledge base is still missing a crucial component: the arguments and identities of the amici supporting the respondents (Eagle County, et al.). The `THINK` action correctly identifies that to form a balanced prediction, I must understand the counterarguments that will be presented to the Court in support of the D.C. Circuit's broader interpretation of NEPA. My confidence in a reversal, while increased by the Utah brief, is provisional until I can weigh the strength of the coalition supporting the respondents. The primary uncertainty remains the nature, breadth, and persuasive power of the amicus support for the D.C. Circuit's decision.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been substantially deepened by the acquisition of the Brief for the Federal Respondents, filed by the Solicitor General (SG) in support of the petitioners. While the search action failed to uncover the amicus briefs supporting the respondents (Eagle County), which remains a critical knowledge gap, it provided a document of paramount importance that clarifies the position of the U.S. government and the Surface Transportation Board (STB).\n\nMy previous beliefs, centered on the three competing legal frameworks (petitioners' \"proximate cause,\" respondents' \"reasonable foreseeability,\" and the SG's \"rule of reason\"), remain the core of my analysis. The significance of the State of Utah's amicus brief, with its federalism and policy arguments, is also preserved.\n\nThe new observation adds the following crucial layers to my understanding:\n\n1.  **Definitive Confirmation of the SG's \"Rule of Reason\" Framework:** I now have the SG's full argument on the merits. It confirms my hypothesis that the government would advocate for a middle-ground position. The brief argues that \"The Surface Transportation Board reasonably limited its consideration of the upstream and downstream effects\" and that \"NEPA permits agencies to draw manageable, context-specific lines in determining the scope of their environmental impact statements.\" This is the \"rule of reason\" in practice.\n\n2.  **Centrality of *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen***: The SG's brief elevates *Public Citizen* (541 U.S. 752) to the status of the controlling precedent. The argument is that, similar to the agency in *Public Citizen*, the STB lacks the statutory authority to regulate the \"upstream\" oil production or \"downstream\" refining. Therefore, under NEPA, it cannot be compelled to conduct an in-depth analysis of effects it has no power to prevent or mitigate. This provides a strong, precedented foundation for reversing the D.C. Circuit.\n\n3.  **Strategic Nuance and a Path for the Court:** Crucially, the SG's brief explicitly distances the government from the petitioners' potentially over-broad \"proximate cause\" test. A section heading states: \"Petitioners err to the extent they suggest that an agency may impose limits on its environmental analysis that do not comport with NEPA\u2019s text or underlying policies.\" By rejecting the petitioners' hardest line while still supporting reversal, the SG offers the Court an attractive \"off-ramp.\" The Court can reverse the D.C. Circuit's expansive \"foreseeability\" standard without adopting a new, rigid \"proximate cause\" test that might unduly limit NEPA in future cases. Instead, it can reaffirm the principles of agency deference and limited scope from *Public Citizen*.\n\n4.  **Formal Alignment of the Agency (STB):** The brief is filed on behalf of the \"Federal Respondents Supporting Petitioners,\" which includes the Surface Transportation Board itself. This is a powerful signal. The very agency whose decision was vacated is now before the Supreme Court arguing that its original analysis was reasonable and legally sufficient. The Court tends to give significant weight to an agency's interpretation of its own statutory duties, especially when backed by the Solicitor General.\n\nIn summary, while the coalition supporting the respondents remains unknown, the position of the petitioners has been massively fortified. The alignment of the petitioner, the State of Utah, the Solicitor General, and the agency itself (STB) presents a formidable front. The SG has provided a well-reasoned, moderate, and precedented argument for reversal that is likely to be persuasive to a majority of the Court. My confidence in a reversal has therefore increased significantly. The primary uncertainty is no longer *if* a strong argument for reversal exists, but whether the respondents and their amici can present a counter-argument compelling enough to overcome the SG's reliance on *Public Citizen* and the \"rule of reason.\"",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Everyone agreed below that agencies are \nnot required to review effects that are not reasonably \nforeseeable. But petitioners go much further than \nthat, and much further than Congress\u2019s recent \namendment:  they ask this Court to give agencies \nbroad permission not to study the consequences of \ntheir actions, even when those consequences affect the \nenvironment, are reasonably foreseeable,  and bear di-\nrectly on the decision before the agency.  Petitioners \noffer numerous different formulations of their rule, \nbut ground none of them in the statutory text. \nThe project at issue here, the Uinta Basin Railway \n(Railway), will affect the environment in respondent \nEagle County, Colorado, in foreseeable, even obvious \nways\u2014yet petitioners seek to take them off the NEPA \ntable.  The Railway\u2019s overriding purpose is to \ntransport crude oil onto the national rail network.  \nNine out of every ten trains that use it would travel \neastbound through Eagle County\u2014doubling the traf-\nfic on an existing rail line along the Colorado River.  \nPetitioners claim that whether that doubling of traffic \n\n2 \n \nwill lead to environmental consequences is \u201cimponder-\nable[].\u201d  Petrs. Br. 1.  The agency here, the Surface \nTransportation Board, certainly did not think so.  It \nrecognized that doubling train traffic would increase \nthe incidence of sparks that can cause wildfires and \nwould produce additional train accidents resulting in \noil spills.  And the environmental consequences of, for \nexample, a derailment of an oil-laden train next to the \nriver are eminently foreseeable.  The agency made \nseveral case-specific errors in dealing with these \n\u201cdownline\u201d consequences, as Eagle County argued be-\nlow and the court of appeals recognized, but the \nagency did not deem them categorically unforeseea-\nble, as petitioners now urge. \nIn a change from the certiorari stage, petitioners \nattempt to argue that their new view of NEPA also \ntreats these concrete downline impacts as not foresee-\nable.  That comes too late.  And as a result, answering \nthe question presented will not change the judgment \nvacating the NEPA decision.  For that reason, com-\nbined with petitioners\u2019 loss of interest in the supposed \ncircuit split they asked the Court to resolve, the Court \nmay wish to consider whether their petition was im-\nprovidently granted. \nEven if the Court entertained petitioners\u2019 belated \nchallenge to these downline impacts, petitioners are \nwrong on what NEPA requires.  Agencies must con-\nsider the reasonably foreseeable effects of federal ac-\ntions, not every effect for which the action is a conceiv-\nable but-for cause.  Petitioners purport to espouse the \nforeseeability standard\u2014as Congress itself has \ndone\u2014but would change it beyond recognition by \nblending in concepts of tort liability and agency pri-\nmacy.  But those limitations are directly contrary to \n\n3 \n \nthe statute and to this Court\u2019s caselaw.  First, an \nagency\u2019s obligation to study environmental conse-\nquences runs deeper than simply asking \u201ccould we be \nsued in tort for this?\u201d  Indeed, even the decision that \npetitioners incorrectly claim \u201call but resolves\u201d this \ncase, Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nu-\nclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), expressly said that \nit was not reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA.  \nAnd Metropolitan Edison\u2019s key holding\u2014that NEPA \ndid not require an agency to consider non-environmen-\ntal harms, such as the psychological harm caused by \nthe fear of a nuclear accident\u2014says little about this \ncase, which involves classic, foreseeable environmen-\ntal effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and \noil spills. \nSecond, an agency cannot ignore a particular envi-\nronmental effect of its own decision merely because \nanother agency might have some jurisdiction over \nthat issue.  To the contrary, NEPA implements a de-\ntailed scheme for inter-agency collaboration\u2014a \nscheme that the Board followed in cooperating with \nfour other federal agencies here.  The statutory text \ndoes not countenance petitioners\u2019 pass-the-buck ap-\nproach. \nThe Court should reject petitioners\u2019 proposal to \ndramatically remake NEPA, along with their efforts \nto rewrite the record below in their attempt to shield \nfrom review multiple agency errors that are outside \nthe question presented.    \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI. Legal Background \nA.  The National Environmental Policy Act \n1. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n(NEPA), Pub. L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (1970) (42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321 et seq.), embodies \u201ca national policy\u201d to \n\u201cencourage productive and enjoyable harmony be-\ntween man and his environment\u201d and to \u201cpromote ef-\nfects which will prevent or eliminate damage to the \nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health \nand welfare of man.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (2023).  These \n\u201csweeping policy goals\u201d are \u201crealized through a set of \n\u2018action-forcing\u2019 procedures that require that agencies \ntake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at environmental consequences\u201d and \n\u201cprovide for broad dissemination of relevant environ-\nmental information.\u201d  Robertson v. Methow Valley Cit-\nizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 350 (1989).   \nNEPA\u2019s procedures are designed to facilitate a ro-\nbust discussion among the agency and the public \nabout the potential effects of an agency action.  Id. at \n352.  This \u201cinformational purpose\u201d is two-fold:  to pro-\nvide \u201cthe public the assurance that the agency has in-\ndeed considered environmental concerns in its deci-\nsionmaking process, and, perhaps more significantly, \n[to] provide[] a springboard for public comment in the \nagency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of \nTransp. v. Pub. Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 768 (2004) \n(quoting Balt. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Nat. Res. Def. Coun-\ncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 97 (1983)).  In other words, \nNEPA \u201censure[s] that the larger audience can provide \ninput as necessary to the agency making the relevant \ndecisions.\u201d  Id. \n\n5 \n \nThus, for certain \u201cmajor Federal actions signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environ-\nment,\u201d an agency must prepare an environmental im-\npact statement (EIS).  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nAs explained by NEPA\u2019s implementing regulations, is-\nsued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), \nthe \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of an EIS is \u201cto serve as an ac-\ntion-forcing device by ensuring agencies consider the \nenvironmental effects of their action in decision mak-\ning, so that the policies and goals defined in the Act \nare infused into the ongoing programs and actions of \nthe Federal Government.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.1(a).  To \naccomplish this goal, an EIS \u201cshall provide full and \nfair discussion of significant effects and shall inform \ndecision makers and the public of reasonable alterna-\ntives that would avoid or minimize adverse effects or \nenhance the quality of the human environment.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 1502.1(b). \nAs originally enacted, NEPA required an EIS to in-\nclude a discussion of, among other factors, the \u201cenvi-\nronmental impact of the proposed action\u201d and \u201cany ad-\nverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided \nshould the proposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) (1970).  In 2023, in a bipartisan re-\nvision of NEPA known as the BUILDER Act, Congress \ncodified the longstanding doctrine regarding the scope \nof the effects that an agency must consider.  See Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 118-5, \u00a7 321, \n137 Stat. 10, 38-46.  The statute now makes explicit \nthat an EIS must address the \u201creasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action\u201d \nand \u201cany reasonably foreseeable adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n(2023) (emphasis added).   \n\n6 \n \nThe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d qualifier comes from \nCEQ\u2019s longstanding regulations, which likewise direct \nagencies to assess \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d environ-\nmental effects.  43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, \n1978) (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)).  Those regula-\ntions define \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur such that a person of ordinary prudence \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 \nFed. Reg. 43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(aa) (2021)); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii). \n2. NEPA requires extensive inter-agency coopera-\ntion with respect to preparation of an EIS.  The stat-\nute anticipates that one agency\u2019s actions will some-\ntimes have environmental effects either regulated by, \nor within the expertise of, another agency.  The first \nagency does not get to pass the buck to the second.  \nRather, by statute, they work together:  \u201cthe lead \nagency shall consult with and obtain the comments of \nany Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  CEQ \nregulations further \u201cemphasize agency cooperation\u201d \nin the NEPA process, and delineate a system of \u201clead\u201d \nand \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(a).  \nWhen \u201cmore than one Federal agency\u201d is \u201cinvolved in \nthe same action,\u201d then the \u201cparticipating Federal \nagencies shall determine \u2026 which agency will be the \nlead agency\u201d based on a set of factors, among them, \nwhich agency has \u201c[p]roject approval or disapproval \nauthority,\u201d the \u201c[m]agnitude of [each] agency\u2019s in-\nvolvement,\u201d and the agencies\u2019 \u201c[e]xpertise concerning \nthe \naction\u2019s \nenvironmental \neffects.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1501.7(a)(1), (c).  \u201cUpon request of the lead agency, \nany Federal agency with jurisdiction by law shall be a \ncooperating agency,\u201d and cooperating agencies with \n\n7 \n \n\u201cspecial expertise\u201d can be asked to prepare relevant \nportions of an EIS.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.8(a), (b)(3).  State and \nlocal agencies can also be \u201ccooperating\u201d agencies, so \nthe EIS process can incorporate their views and ex-\npertise as well.  Id. \u00a7 1501.8(a). \nB.  Railroad Regulation by the Surface \nTransportation Board \nUnder the ICC Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), \nthe Surface Transportation Board (Board) has exclu-\nsive jurisdiction over the interstate rail network, in-\ncluding \u201ctransportation by rail carriers\u201d and \u201cthe con-\nstruction, acquisition, [and] operation\u201d of railway \nlines.  49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10501(b)(1)-(2).  Constructing and \noperating a new railroad line requires the Board\u2019s ap-\nproval.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 10901(a), 10902(a).     \nTo receive the necessary authorization, a party has \ntwo options.  The first is to submit an application de-\ntailing the proposed use of the line, including certain \noperational, financial, and environmental data.  See \n49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1150.1 et seq.  After entertaining public \ncomment, the Board must issue the certificate unless \nit \u201cfinds that such activities are inconsistent with the \npublic convenience and necessity.\u201d  49 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 10901(c).  \nUnder an alternative pathway\u2014the one petition-\ners followed here\u2014a party may seek an exemption \nfrom the application process.  The Board may grant \nan exemption only if it determines, among other \nthings, that a full application proceeding \u201cis not nec-\nessary to carry out the transportation policy of\u201d 49 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 10101.  Id. \u00a7 10502(a).  Section 10101, in \nturn, declares that, \u201c[i]n regulating the railroad in-\n\n8 \n \ndustry, it is the policy of the United States Govern-\nment\u201d to take fifteen specified actions\u2014including, for \nexample, \u201cto operate transportation facilities and \nequipment without detriment to the public health and \nsafety\u201d and \u201cto encourage and promote energy conser-\nvation.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 10101(8), (14).   \nThus, in deciding whether to allow a new rail line, \nthe Board considers not only competition and effi-\nciency, but also environmental considerations rele-\nvant to \u201cthe public health and safety.\u201d  The Board has \n\u201cauthority to deny [an] exemption petition if the envi-\nronmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its \ntransportation benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  For this rea-\nson, the Board\u2019s decisionmaking regularly entails as-\nsessing environmental consequences, and the Board \nmaintains its own in-house experts in an Office of En-\nvironmental Analysis (OEA). \nThe Board recognizes that it must follow NEPA\u2019s \nrequirements, including to prepare an EIS.  The \nBoard\u2019s regulations specify that an \u201cEnvironmental \nImpact Statement will normally be prepared for rail \nconstruction proposals,\u201d except in certain specific cir-\ncumstances \nnot \napplicable \nhere. \n \n49 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 1105.6(a)-(b).  The Board also applies its own envi-\nronmental requirements, which direct an applicant \nfor a rail construction project to submit an \u201c[e]nviron-\nmental [r]eport\u201d describing a range of effects on land \nuse, energy, air quality, noise, safety, biological re-\nsources, and water.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e).   \nThe environmental report must include an evalua-\ntion of \u201cindirect or down-line impacts\u201d of rail construc-\ntion when certain thresholds are met, as they were \nhere.  Id. \u00a7 1105.7(e)(11)(v).  The Board will include an \nanalysis of potential effects on air quality if a decision \n\n9 \n \nwill result in an increase of either three or eight trains \na day on a given line, depending on whether certain \npollutants in the relevant areas exceed air-quality \nstandards.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1105.7(e)(5)(i)(A), (11)(v).  The \nBoard has determined that these same three- or eight-\ntrain thresholds should govern the Board\u2019s review of \ndownline safety issues, and it regularly applies these \nthresholds to define the downline study area for a par-\nticular project.  J.A.483-484; see also Pet.App.39a.    \nII. Factual Background \nA. The Board Prepares an EIS and Approves \nthe Railway \n1. In May 2020, petitioners sought approval from \nthe Board to build the Railway to connect the Uinta \nBasin in northeast Utah to the national rail network.  \nPet.App.6a-7a.  \u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that the \u201cpredom-\ninant and expected primary purpose\u201d of the Railway \nis to transport \u201cwaxy crude oil produced in the Uinta \nBasin.\u201d  Pet.App.7a.   \nThe Railway would connect at Kyune, Utah, to an \nexisting railway line operated by the Union Pacific \nRailroad Company (the Union Pacific or UP Line).  \nCrude oil shipped out of the Uinta Basin on the Rail-\nway and bound for points east\u2014which would be 90% \nof the oil, J.A.513\u2014would have no way to travel except \nby the UP Line between Kyune and Denver, Colorado.  \nFor about half of that stretch, including the portion \ncrossing respondent Eagle County (the County), the \nUP Line follows the upper Colorado River.  Thus, nine \nout of ten trains carrying crude oil out of the Uinta \nBasin would take the UP Line along the Colorado \nRiver\u2014and cross through the County.  J.A.513-514; \n\n10 \n \nPet.App.12a, 113a; see also J.A.7-8, 42-43.  Each train \ncan be nearly 2 miles in length.  C.A.App.888.   \n2.  Petitioners sought an exemption for the Rail-\nway under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502.  Pet.App.6a-8a.  The \nBoard\u2019s OEA determined that an EIS was necessary; \nset the scope of study for the EIS based on public in-\nput, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,274 (Dec. 13, 2019); and pub-\nlished a Draft EIS on October 30, 2020.  During the \ncomment period, the Board received over 1,900 sub-\nmissions.  J.A.115-116.  The Final EIS followed on Au-\ngust 6, 2021.  Pet.App.76a.  \nAs relevant to the County, the EIS identified a set \nof \u201cdownline impacts,\u201d referring to \u201cimpacts that could \noccur along existing rail lines as a result of increased \nrail traffic due to the addition of new trains originat-\ning or terminating on the proposed rail line.\u201d  J.A.511; \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 68,278.  \u201cIncreased rail traffic \nwould have the greatest impacts on the segment of the \nexisting UP rail line between Kyune and Denver be-\ncause this segment is the longest existing rail line seg-\nment in the downline study area and would receive \nthe most new rail traffic if the proposed rail line were \nconstructed.\u201d  J.A.202.   \nOEA calculated that the UP Line would experience \nan increase in traffic of up to 9.5 additional trains per \nday.  J.A.294; C.A.App.886, 888.  And based on that \nforecast, OEA determined that \u201csome downline im-\npacts are reasonably foreseeable.\u201d  J.A.511.  Relying \non national data for train accident rates, J.A.487-490, \nOEA determined that the UP Line would experience a \nsignificant increase in the risk of rail accidents, rang-\ning between a 40% jump in a low traffic scenario to \n\u201cmore than two times\u201d the current risk in a high traf-\nfic scenario.  J.A.202.  This increase translates to up \n\n11 \n \nto 0.89 additional predicted accidents per year involv-\ning a loaded oil train on the UP Line.  J.A.203.  In \nother words, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude oil \ntrain would occur slightly less than once per year un-\nder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d as a result of con-\nstruction of the Railway.  Id.  \nOEA further determined that approximately 26% \nof these accidents would result in an oil spill.  J.A.495-\n496.  Put slightly differently, once every four years the \nenvironment adjacent to the Union Pacific Line will \nface an oil spill.  Id.  And given the size of a train, the \nvast majority (almost 75%) of those spills will involve \n30,000 gallons or more of oil.  Id.    \nThe EIS also discussed the increased risk of wild-\nfires near the UP Line.  As OEA explained, trains \u201ccan \ncontribute to wildfires by providing an ignition \nsource,\u201d most commonly exhaust sparks (carbon par-\nticles emitted from the locomotive engine) or matter \nfrom overheated brakes.  J.A.282.  Among other fac-\ntors, grade changes\u2014which are unavoidable as a train \ncrosses the Rocky Mountains, for instance\u2014are a sig-\nnificant factor for exhaust-spark fires.  See id.  Matter \nfrom overheated brakes also starts fires.  Id. \nOEA recognized that \u201c[t]rains originating or termi-\nnating on the [Railway] could be an ignition source for \nwildfires along existing rail lines outside of the study \narea.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  Despite that, OEA reasoned that, \n\u201cbecause those existing rail lines are active rail lines \nthat have been in operation for many years, construc-\ntion and operation of the proposed rail line would not \nintroduce a new ignition source for wildfires along the \ndownline segments.\u201d  J.A.285.  OEA also determined \nthat there was a \u201clow\u201d probability that a train would \ncause a wildfire based on historic data on the causes \n\n12 \n \nof wildfires in Utah between 1992 and 2015.  J.A.245-\n246.  OEA thus concluded that \u201cthe downline wildfire \nimpact of the proposed rail line would not be signifi-\ncant.\u201d  J.A.285.  \nThe EIS notably did not evaluate the effect of the \ndownline increase in rail traffic on the Colorado River, \ndespite its proximity to the UP Line along much of the \nrelevant \nstretch. \n \nPet.App.46a; \nJ.A.206-242; \nC.A.App.902-949.  Rather, OEA\u2019s analysis of the im-\npacts on water resources pertained solely to the area \ndirectly adjacent to the new Railway in Utah\u2014specif-\nically, the watershed study area that the Railway it-\nself would cross, along with a \u201c1,000-foot-wide corri-\ndor along much of the rail centerline.\u201d  C.A.App. 902. \n3.  Following issuance of the final EIS, the Board \ngranted petitioners\u2019 exemption petition and author-\nized construction and operation of the Railway in De-\ncember 2021.  Pet.App.74a-189a.  The Board deter-\nmined that \u201cthe transportation merits of the project \noutweigh the environmental impacts,\u201d Pet.App.121a, \nlargely adopting OEA\u2019s environmental analysis from \nthe EIS, Pet.App.84a-85a.   \nThe Board \u201cadopt[ed] OEA\u2019s reasonable analysis \nconcerning wildfires,\u201d including its analysis that be-\ncause the \u201cexisting rail lines are active rail lines that \nhave been in operation for many years, construction \nand operation of the Line would not introduce a new \nignition source for wildfires along the downline seg-\nments.\u201d  Pet.App.94a.  The Board did not separately \ndiscuss the EIS\u2019s analysis of effects from downline rail \naccidents, nor did it address the potential impact on \nthe Colorado River. \n\n13 \n \nBoard Member Oberman dissented on the basis \nthat the \u201cproject\u2019s environmental impacts outweigh its \ntransportation merits.\u201d  Pet.App. 23a.    \nB. The Board\u2019s Decision and EIS Are \nVacated On Multiple Grounds \nThe County and several environmental organiza-\ntions petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision.  \nThe D.C. Circuit granted the petitions in part, denied \nthem in part, vacated the underlying order and part \nof the EIS, and remanded to the Board.  Pet.App.1a-\n71a. \n1. The court of appeals agreed with the County \nthat the Board made several foundational errors in as-\nsessing the Railway\u2019s downline impacts.1  None of the \ncourt\u2019s analysis of downline impacts turned on fore-\nseeability. \nFirst, the court concluded that OEA erred in deter-\nmining that \u201cthe downline wildfire impact of the pro-\nposed rail line would not be significant.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.  \nOEA\u2019s determination rested on its conclusion that the \n\u201cconstruction and operation of the [Railway] would \nnot introduce a new ignition source for wildfires along \nthe downline segments,\u201d because the rail lines are \u201cac-\ntive rail lines that have been in operation for many \nyears.\u201d  Pet.App.42a-43a.  The court characterized \nthis conclusion as \u201cutterly unreasoned,\u201d \u201cnot the \u2018hard \nlook\u2019 that NEPA requires.\u201d Pet.App.44a-45a.  Regard-\nless of whether new trains are a new type of ignition \nsource, the court explained that the \u201csignificant in-\ncrease in the frequency of which existing ignition \nsources travel\u201d the Union Pacific Line\u2014\u201cup to 9.5 new \n \n1 The court also identified APA violations separate from NEPA.  \nPet.App.50a-69a. \n\n14 \n \ntrains a day\u201d\u2014\u201cequally poses an increased risk of \nfire.\u201d  Id. \nSecond, the court of appeals agreed with the \nCounty that the Board erred by failing to evaluate ad-\nverse impacts on downline water resources, in partic-\nular the \u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River that \u201cparallels the \nUnion Pacific Line.\u201d  Id.  As the court explained, the \nrecord had \u201cno evidence \u2026 that the Board even con-\nsidered the potential impacts on water resources \ndownline of running up to 9.5 loaded oil trains a day \non the Union Pacific Line\u2014about 50% of which abuts \nthe Colorado River,\u201d even though the County, the \nState of Colorado, and others had squarely raised \nthose concerns.  Pet.App.46a; see J.A.8-9, 23-24 (dis-\ncussing the effect of an oil spill on the Colorado River, \na \u201cwater supply for millions\u201d).  Indeed, the \u201cBoard con-\ncededly fail[ed] altogether to mention the Colorado \nRiver in the Final EIS\u2019s discussion of impacts on wa-\nter resources.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  Again, this analysis was \nnot the \u201chard look\u201d NEPA requires. Id. at 47a. \nFinally, the court of appeals concluded that the \nBoard erred by modeling the risk of rail accidents \nbased on generalized national data.  Pet.App.41a.  As \nthe court explained, OEA failed to account for the par-\nticular \u201clikelihood of derailment for long trains carry-\ning oil through the Mountain West.\u201d  Id.  It also as-\nsumed with no foundation \u201cthat accident rates for \nloaded trains would be the same as those for empty \ntrains.\u201d  Id.  When commenters identified this prob-\nlem, OEA shrugged that \u201cinsufficient data exist\u201d on \nthe accident rates for oil trains.  Id.  But when relying \non a lack of information, the court of appeals held, the \nEIS must at least explain \u201cwhy the information was \n\n15 \n \nunavailable and what actions the agency took to ad-\ndress that unavailability.\u201d  Pet.App.41a-42a; see also \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22(b) (2020) (outlining process for \ncontending with \u201cincomplete or unavailable infor-\nmation\u201d relevant to an EIS).2  Once again, OEA thus \n\u201cfailed to take a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the increased risk of rail \naccidents downline given the increased rail traffic re-\nsulting from the Railway.\u201d  Id. at 40a.3 \n2. Separately from its discussion of downline im-\npacts, the court of appeals concluded that OEA erred \nin failing to consider the impacts of increased crude oil \nrefining along the Gulf Coast.  The court disagreed \nwith OEA that these effects were not reasonably fore-\nseeable, and further rejected the argument that OEA \nwas not required to consider these effects on the basis \nthat it could not \u201cregulate or mitigate\u201d these impacts.  \nPet.App.30a-31a.     \n3. In light of the \u201csignificant\u201d \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the \nBoard\u2019s analysis, the court of appeals concluded that \nthe Board had improperly approved the Railway.  \nPet.App.70a.  As the court explained, the \u201cpoor envi-\nronmental review alone renders arbitrary the Board\u2019s \nconsideration of the relevant Rail Policies and the fi-\nnal order\u2019s exemption of the Railway.\u201d  Id.  The court \n \n2 This provision is now found in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 43,366-67. \n3 The court of appeals did not accept the County\u2019s and environ-\nmental groups\u2019 arguments in their entirety, instead undertaking \na careful, nuanced assessment of each downline impact.  To take \none example, the court rejected the environmental groups\u2019 argu-\nment that OEA failed to take a hard look at the geological risk of \nlandslides attributable to the Railway downline.  Pet.App.48a-\n50a.  \n\n16 \n \ntherefore vacated the underlying approval and part of \nthe EIS and remanded the case to the Board.     \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should affirm the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur \nof the Board\u2019s analysis of downline impacts in Colo-\nrado.  The Board properly concluded that certain \ndownline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \ntherefore needed to be included in the Board\u2019s evalua-\ntion of whether to approve the Railway.  The Board \nerred, however, by relying on demonstrably incorrect \nassumptions or otherwise faulty premises when eval-\nuating the magnitude of those effects.  As the D.C. Cir-\ncuit recognized, the Board\u2019s determination therefore \nfailed to comply with NEPA\u2019s well-established \u201chard \nlook\u201d requirement.  There is no basis for disturbing \nthis straightforward, highly factbound component of \nthe decision below.   \nI.  Petitioners\u2019 belated objection to the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s evaluation of downline impacts in Colorado is \nnot properly before the Court.  The petition for certio-\nrari limited its challenge to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding \nthat the Board erred in declining to consider the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment.  While the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of this issue \nwas correct, it does not bear on the separate, highly \nfactbound question whether the Board correctly eval-\nuated downline impacts (e.g., wildfires, rail accidents, \nand water contamination) in Colorado.  Critically, un-\ntil petitioners\u2019 opening brief before this court, no one\u2014\nthe Board included\u2014questioned whether these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable and there-\nfore properly part of the Board\u2019s analysis.  Regardless \nof the answer to the question presented, this Court \n\n17 \n \nshould not disturb the D.C. Circuit\u2019s vacatur with re-\nspect to downline impacts.   \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 approach to NEPA is wrong.  Par-\nticularly after the BUILDER Act, petitioners have no \nchoice but to accept that NEPA requires agencies to \nevaluate the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d impacts of a fed-\neral action.  As reflected both by decades of circuit \nprecedent and by CEQ regulations, whether an effect \nis reasonably foreseeable turns on the materiality of \ninformation for the decisionmaker.  If an effect is suf-\nficiently likely to occur that a prudent person would \ntake it into account in reaching a decision, then it is \nreasonably foreseeable.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Cir. 1992); 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(ii). \nThis standard does not, and should not, mirror the \nscope of private tort liability.  The purpose of NEPA is \nto inform both the agency and the public of the im-\npacts of a particular project.  Limiting this review to \neffects that could give rise to tort liability flouts \nNEPA\u2019s directive to consider indirect effects, and more \nfundamentally conflicts with NEPA\u2019s goal of ensuring \nthat the agency and the public writ large are informed \nof the reasonably foreseeable outcomes of a project. \nNor is the scope of NEPA review properly limited \nto those effects over which the lead agency has exclu-\nsive or even primary jurisdiction.  As reflected by this \ncase, NEPA includes a comprehensive scheme for co-\noperation among both state and federal agencies.  \nWhen a particular effect falls within the expertise of \na different agency, NEPA contemplates that the \nagency will participate in the EIS process as a cooper-\nating agency\u2014and not, as petitioners appear to con-\ntemplate, that an effect can simply fall by the wayside \n\n18 \n \nbecause it is not in the wheelhouse of the agency in \ncharge of the EIS.       \nIII.  Applying these well-established standards, \nthe D.C. Circuit correctly determined that the Board \nerred in its evaluation of downline impacts.  As the \ncourt recognized, OEA\u2019s evaluation of the magnitude \nof these impacts rested on a series of fundamental er-\nrors.  Nothing in petitioners\u2019 amorphous concept of \nforeseeability, or their references to the \u201crule of rea-\nson,\u201d justifies ignoring these significant defects in the \nagency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  \nFirst, OEA disregarded the increased risk of wild-\nfires from the significant increase in train traffic.  \nOEA concluded that additional trains crossing the \nUnion Pacific Line would not be a new type of ignition \nsource, but as OEA recognized elsewhere in the same \nEIS, the increased risk comes from the greater fre-\nquency of trains.   \nSecond, OEA entirely failed to evaluate the effect \nthat the increase in rail traffic will have on the Colo-\nrado River, even though the river abuts half of the UP \nLine.  The Board\u2019s post hoc suggestion that it could \nuse OEA\u2019s evaluation of the impacts on waterways in \nUtah as a stand-in is both procedurally improper and \nfactually flawed. \nFinally, OEA incorrectly evaluated the risk of ac-\ncidents\u2014a fundamental underpinning of its entire re-\nview of downline effects\u2014by relying on national rates \nof derailment.  This project would involve a significant \nincrease in long trains loaded with crude oil travers-\ning difficult terrain in the Mountain West.  Given \nthese three significant errors, the D.C. Circuit \n\n19 \n \nproperly vacated the portion of the EIS evaluating \ndownline impacts in Colorado.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Evaluation of \nDownline Impacts Is Not Implicated By The \nQuestion Presented. \nThe question presented is about foreseeability un-\nder NEPA, but petitioners have opportunistically \ntried to smuggle in more.  They ask this Court to val-\nidate the Board\u2019s EIS in its entirety\u2014but several \nflaws in the EIS are outside the question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari.  Indeed, petitioners\u2019 entire \nmerits theory has shifted substantially from their pe-\ntition, and the split they claimed needed resolution \nhas disappeared from their briefing.   \nEagle County demonstrated below several failures \nof the Board\u2019s EIS that had nothing to do with the \nBoard\u2019s approach to reasonable foreseeability.  The \nBoard did not attempt to argue that either NEPA or \nits own authorizing statute allowed it to ignore the \nrisks of wildfires caused by trains, oil spills caused by \nderailments, and other effects on the Colorado River \nnext to the UP Line.  To the contrary, it concluded that \nthese possibilities were reasonably foreseeable, \nPet.App.110a, and proceeded to consider them.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. 40.  And petitioners did not dispute the fore-\nseeability of those effects.  Nor did the decision below, \nwhich held that the Board had failed to take the nec-\nessary \u201chard look\u201d at these potential consequences of \na decision to let the Railway proceed.   \nPetitioners therefore brought to the Court a ques-\ntion that does not encompass the substance of that \n\u201chard look\u201d review.  Rather, they contended that what \n\n20 \n \nneeded review was whether NEPA \u201crequires an \nagency to study environmental impacts beyond the \nproximate effects of the action over which the agency \nhas regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i.  Specifically, they \ncontended that the court of appeals had erred in \u201cor-\nder[ing] the Board to study the local effects of oil wells \nand refineries that lie outside the Board\u2019s regulatory \nauthority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  The petition con-\ntained no argument at all about \u201cdownline\u201d impacts \nalong the UP Line, such as wildfires and oil spills. \nBut now petitioners want the Court to validate the \nBoard\u2019s entire EIS and hold that wildfire, oil spills, \nand river pollution are too remote from the Board\u2019s \ndecision on the Railway\u2014or, perhaps, excused from \nconsideration by some more nebulous \u201crule of reason.\u201d  \nTheir position is incorrect, as shown below, but the \nCourt need not even consider it.  Any challenge to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 evaluation of downline impacts in \nColorado is not \u201cfairly included\u201d within the question \npresented.  See Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kai-\nsha v. U.S. Philips Corp., 510 U.S. 27, 31-32 (1993); S. \nCt. Rule 14.1(a). \nPut another way, the answer to the question pre-\nsented will not affect the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to va-\ncate the Board\u2019s NEPA analysis as arbitrary and ca-\npricious.  Because the Board and the D.C. Circuit \nagreed that the downline impacts are reasonably fore-\nseeable effects of the regulatory action over which the \nBoard has regulatory authority, their analysis of \nthose impacts did not implicate the supposed circuit \nsplit that petitioners asked this Court to resolve.   \nPetitioners have now all but dropped any mention \nof that split, see Petrs. Br. 5-6 (briefly suggesting in \nthe Background that some circuits \u201ctake a decidedly \n\n21 \n \nmore balanced view\u201d of the scope of NEPA review), but \npetitioners\u2019 own description of the purported split il-\nlustrates that it does not implicate the downline im-\npacts raised by the County.  See id.  Petitioners argue \nthat their preferred circuits make clear that \u201cagencies \nneed only study effects that are both proximate and \nenvironmental and do not fall outside the agency\u2019s \nscope of authority.\u201d  Id.  The Board never suggested \nthat the increased risk of wildfire started by sparks \nfrom a train, or the increased risk of an oil spill into \nthe Colorado River caused by a train accident, were \nnot proximate, not environmental, or outside the \nscope of its authority. \nThe Government agrees:  It does not argue for re-\nversal of the entirety of the court\u2019s NEPA analysis, but \nonly the \u201cportion of the court of appeals\u2019 decision\u201d ad-\ndressing \u201cthe upstream and downstream effects of oil \nand gas development.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 45.   \nThus, the outcome of this case cannot save the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis.  The County prevailed on its \narbitrary-and-capricious claims because the Board\u2019s \nanalysis of downline impacts was simply not an ade-\nquate \u201chard look\u201d\u2014not because of a lack of foreseea-\nbility or a lack of regulatory authority.  And petition-\ners cannot bring the entire EIS within the scope of this \nCourt\u2019s review just by sprinkling the term \u201crule of rea-\nson\u201d over everything.  \nII. The Scope of EIS Review Turns on the \nMateriality of Information to the \nDecisionmaking Process. \nOn the merits of the legal standard, petitioners os-\ncillate between asking the Court merely to restate its \n\n22 \n \nholdings in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, \nand asking for something far more extreme.   \nTo the extent petitioners argue\u2014as they must\u2014\nthat NEPA requires agencies to consider reasonably \nforeseeable environmental effects, that reasonable \nforeseeability is not but-for causation, and that an \nagency need not study an effect that it has no author-\nity to consider in its decision, then all parties and the \ncourt below are in agreement.  Many of petitioners\u2019 \nstraw-man arguments about supposedly \u201cunlimited\u201d \nprocess simply disregard these well-settled limita-\ntions. \nBut petitioners attempt to sneak new limitations \ninto these well-established principles\u2014a rule equat-\ning the scope of NEPA review with the boundary of \ntort liability, and a free-floating version of the \u201crule of \nreason\u201d that would let agencies decline to study effects \nthey would rather ignore.  Those limitations find no \nsupport in the text, structure, decades-long history, or \ncongressional understanding of NEPA.  And adopting \nthem would substantially restrict the ability of states, \nlocalities, and the public to meaningfully participate \nin decisions regarding the federal actions that will \nsubstantially impact their communities. \nA. NEPA Has Long Been Understood to \nExtend to \u201cReasonably Foreseeable\u201d \nImpacts. \nAs originally enacted, NEPA directed agencies to \nprepare an EIS evaluating \u201cthe environmental impact \nof [a] proposed action\u201d and \u201cany adverse environmen-\ntal effects which cannot be avoided should the pro-\nposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i)-(ii) \n\n23 \n \n(1970).  The statute did not define either \u201cenvironmen-\ntal impact\u201d or \u201cenvironmental effect[],\u201d but from the \noutset, courts and agencies alike interpreted this pro-\nvision to require agencies to evaluate environmental \neffects that are reasonably foreseeable.  That con-\ncept\u2014reasonable foreseeability\u2014has now been made \nexplicit in the statute, in the 2023 amendment post-\ndating the Board\u2019s EIS. \nThe earliest NEPA decisions recognized that an \nEIS \u201cneed not review all possible environmental ef-\nfects of a project,\u201d but rather those that are \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable.\u201d  Swain v. Brinegar, 542 F.2d 364, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1976).  Thus, while NEPA does not \u201cdemand \nwhat is, fairly speaking, not meaningfully possible,\u201d it \ndoes require agencies \u201cto describe the reasonably fore-\nseeable environmental impact\u201d of the program under \nconsiderations.  Scientists\u2019 Inst. for Pub. Info., Inc. v. \nAtomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 481 F.2d 1079, 1092 (D.C. \nCir. 1973).  In other words, the statute compels some \n\u201c[r]easonable forecasting.\u201d  Id. \nCEQ adopted the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d stand-\nard in its regulations almost five decades ago.  43 Fed. \nReg. at 56,004 (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(b) (1979)); 87 Fed. \nReg. 23,453, 23,466-67 (Apr. 20, 2022) (40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(g) (2022)).  Under the regulations both then \nand now, agencies must consider the \u201cdirect,\u201d \u201cindi-\nrect,\u201d and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects of an action.  40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 1508.1(i).   Direct effects \u201care caused by the action \nand occur at the same time and place\u201d; indirect effects \nare \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d effects that \u201care caused \nby the action\u201d but \u201care later in time or farther removed \nin distance\u201d; and \u201ccumulative\u201d effects are \u201ceffects on \nthe environment that result from the incremental ef-\nfects of the action when added to the effects of other \n\n24 \n \npast, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions re-\ngardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or \nperson undertakes such other actions.\u201d  Id.  \nCongress then added the \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d \nstandard to NEPA in 2023.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(2023).  An earlier draft of the BUILDER Act would \nhave directed agencies to consider \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable environmental effects with a reasonably close \ncausal relationship to the proposed agency action.\u201d  \nH.R. 2515, 117th Cong., \u00a7 2(a)(3)(B)(i).  But the ver-\nsion of the bill that ultimately passed maintained only \nthe \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d requirement; it excised \nthe phrase \u201creasonably close causal relationship.\u201d  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C)(i) (2023).4  It likewise dropped \nparticular temporal and geographic limits on what \nagencies needed to evaluate.  See H.R. 2515, supra, \n\u00a7 2(b) (proposed new NEPA \u00a7 109(13)).  The final Act \nrequires agencies to \u201cinclude in every recommenda-\ntion or report on proposals for legislation and other \nmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the qual-\nity of the human environment, a detailed statement \nby the responsible official on (i) reasonably foreseeable \nenvironmental effects of the proposed agency action \n[and] (ii) any reasonably foreseeable adverse environ-\nmental effects which cannot be avoided should the \n \n4 From 2020 to 2022, CEQ briefly included the same \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d language in its NEPA regulations.  40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(g) (2020).  CEQ reverted to the prior language in \n2022, asking solely whether an effect was reasonably foreseeable.  \n87 Fed. Reg. at 23,453.  In so doing, it explained that the phrase \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d was \u201cunnecessary and un-\nhelpful because an agency\u2019s ability to exclude effects too attenu-\nated from its actions is adequately addressed by the longstanding \nprinciple of reasonable foreseeability that has guided NEPA \nanalysis for decades.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 23,465. \n\n25 \n \nproposal be implemented.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) \n(2023).   \nRather than unsettle the concept of reasonable \nforeseeability, Congress chose to include reforms in \nthe BUILDER Act that would speed the NEPA process \nin other ways.  Most notably, the BUILDER Act im-\nposed page and time limitations on NEPA review and \nadopted exclusions from NEPA\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4336a(e), (g) (2023), 4336e(10)(B) (2023). \nB. Reasonable Foreseeability Turns on the \nMateriality of Information for the \nDecisionmaker. \n1.  NEPA \u201cdoes not mandate particular results,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cprescribes the necessary process\u201d to en-\nsure that the choice will be a well-informed one.  Rob-\nertson, 490 U.S. at 350.  The EIS process in particular \nis designed to ensure \u201cthat the relevant information \nwill be made available to the larger audience that may \nalso play a role in both the decisionmaking process \nand the implementation of that decision.\u201d  Id. at 349.  \nBy engaging in this process, agencies are \u201cmore likely \nto consider the views of those who live and work in the \nsurrounding community\u201d when evaluating a particu-\nlar project.  Council on Environmental Quality, Exec-\nutive Office of the President, The National Environ-\nmental Policy Act:  A Study of Effectiveness After \nTwenty-Five Years 7 (1997).  And, as a corollary, agen-\ncies are less likely to \u201csteamroll local communities \nwith federal projects.\u201d  Robert L. Glicksman & Alejan-\ndra E. Camacho, The Trump Card: Tarnishing Plan-\nning, Democracy, and the Environment, 50 ENV. L. \nREP. 10281, 10282 n.12 (Apr. 2020) (quoting a Colo-\nrado official\u2019s description of NEPA).  Ultimately, \nNEPA\u2019s \u201cfundamental objective is promoting good \n\n26 \n \ngovernment and democratic decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. at \n10283.  \nReflecting these principles, the touchstone of the \nreasonable foreseeability standard is the materiality \nof information for the decisionmaker.  Agency officials \nshould consider effects that will inform whether to \nmove ahead with a project.  For decades, then, circuits \nacross the country have defined an environmental \nconsequence as \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when it is \nsufficiently likely to occur that a prudent person \nwould take it into account in reaching a decision.   \nThe First Circuit articulated this consensus stand-\nard in Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st \nCir. 1992).  There the court explained that the \u201c\u2018duty\u2019 \nto discuss in the EIS\u201d is \u201cmeasured by an objective \nstandard.\u201d  Id.  \u201cThat is, a likelihood of occurrence, \nwhich gives rise to the duty, is determined from the \nperspective of the person of ordinary prudence in the \nposition of the decisionmaker at the time the decision \nis made about what to include in the EIS.\u201d  Id.  Apply-\ning this standard, agencies \u201cneed not consider poten-\ntial effects that are highly speculative or indefinite.\u201d  \nId. at 768.  And \u201c[w]hether a particular set of impacts \nis definite enough to take into account, or too specula-\ntive to warrant consideration,\u201d turns on the relevance \nand usefulness of particular information to the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  Id.  The First Cir-\ncuit elaborated:  \u201cWith what confidence can one say \nthat the impacts are likely to occur?\u201d  Id.  And \u201c[c]an \none describe them \u2018now\u2019 with sufficient specificity to \nmake their consideration useful?\u201d  Id.  The \u201cordinary \nprudence\u201d standard became the settled understand-\ning of whether a particular impact was reasonably \nforeseeable.  E.g., Solar Energy Indus. Ass\u2019n v. FERC, \n\n27 \n \n80 F.4th 956, 995 (9th Cir. 2023); Dine Citizens \nAgainst Ruining Our Env\u2019t v. Bernhardt, 923 F.3d \n831, 853 (10th Cir. 2019); Ctr. for Biological Diversity \nv. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, 941 F.3d 1288, 1293 \n(11th Cir. 2019); EarthReports, Inc. v. FERC, 828 F.3d \n949, 955 (D.C. Circ. 2016); Ark. Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, 431 F.3d 1096, 1102 (8th \nCir. 2005); La. Crawfish Producers Ass\u2019n-W v. Rowan, \n463 F.3d 352, 358 (5th Cir. 2006).   \n2.  This definition is now in CEQ\u2019s regulations as \nwell.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.1(ii).  In 2020, CEQ \u201cpro-\npose[d] to define \u2018reasonably foreseeable\u2019 consistent \nwith the ordinary person standard\u2014that is what a \nperson of ordinary prudence would consider in reach-\ning a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. 1,684, 1,710 (Jan. 10, \n2020).  It then adopted this definition in the 2020 final \nrule, citing the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Sierra Club \nv. Marsh to explain the \u201cordinary prudence\u201d standard.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 43,351.   \nCEQ maintained this definition in its 2022 regula-\ntions, explaining that agencies \u201care not required to \n\u2018foresee the unforeseeable\u2019 or engage in speculative \nanalysis,\u201d but are required to evaluate \u201cwhat a person \nof ordinary prudence would consider in reaching a de-\ncision.\u201d  89 Fed. Reg. 35,442, 35,550 (May 1, 2024).  \nWhile commenters suggested various changes to this \nformulation, CEQ responded that it was \u201cunaware of \nany practical challenges or confusion that has arisen \nfrom connecting this definition to the ordinary per-\nson,\u201d and it saw no need to \u201ccreate uncertainty\u201d by \nchanging the regulatory text.  Id.   \n3.  This decades-old understanding of \u201creasonable \nforeseeability\u201d plainly informed Congress\u2019s decision to \ncodify that standard in the BUILDER Act.   That is \n\n28 \n \nnot just the ordinary presumption when codifying an \nadministrative interpretation\u2014that is also what the \nChair of the House Natural Resources Committee con-\nfirmed.  He explained that, \u201cin amending NEPA to in-\nclude the concept of reasonable foreseeability, Con-\ngress intends to establish in statute Sierra Club v. \nMarsh, 976 F.2d 763 (1st Cir. 1992).\u201d  169 Cong. Rec. \nH2704 (daily ed. May 31, 2023) (remarks of Rep. \nWesterman).   \n4.  The Government adopts a differently worded \nformulation, suggesting that an agency may \u201cfind that \nthe requisite causal connection is absent or dimin-\nished where the scope of the agency action and the na-\nture and requirements of the governing statutes ren-\nder a particular harm too attenuated, speculative, \ncontingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to the \nagency decision under consideration.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 27.  \nThis standard is difficult to evaluate in the abstract, \nand the Government (properly recognizing the scope \nof the question presented and the nature of the deci-\nsion below) does not apply it to the agency\u2019s evaluation \nof downline impacts in Colorado.   \nTo the extent it captures the question whether a \nparticular impact will \u201cinfluence the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking\u201d or \u201cprovide \u2018a springboard\u2019 for meaning-\nful public comments,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 27 (quoting Public Cit-\nizen, 541 U.S. at 768), the government\u2019s reformulation \nmay not be a substantial revision.  But this standard \ncannot be used as a free pass\u2014akin to versions of Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 rule of reason theory\u2014to decline to study \ncertain environmental effects otherwise within \nNEPA\u2019s scope.  In particular, as described in the brief \nfor the Environmental Respondents, NEPA does not \n\n29 \n \npermit agencies to decline to study reasonably fore-\nseeable effects just because they deem them \u201cother-\nwise insufficiently material\u201d\u2014separate and apart \nfrom being \u201ctoo attenuated, speculative, [or] contin-\ngent.\u201d  See Br. of Env\u2019t Resps. at 43-44. \nC. The NEPA Reasonable Foreseeability \nStandard Is Broader Than Tort Liability. \nPetitioners rely on Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Peo-\nple Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. 766 (1983), and \nDepartment of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 \nU.S. 752, 754 (2004), to argue that the NEPA reason-\nable foreseeability standard equates to tort law\u2019s \nstandard of proximate cause.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  It \nis noncontroversial that NEPA\u2019s causal requirement \nis, as the Court put it in Public Citizen, \u201cakin to\u201d prox-\nimate cause.  541 U.S. at 754.  The concept of \u201cproxi-\nmate cause\u201d has been consistently invoked by the \ncourts of appeals\u2014including the D.C. Circuit, which \npetitioners repeatedly criticize\u2014to underscore that \nNEPA does not require agencies to consider every but-\nfor cause of a particular project.  See Sierra Club v. \nFERC, 867 F.3d 1357, 1380-81 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (using \nthe concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain that \u201cthe \nfact that [an agency\u2019s] action is a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of an \nenvironmental effect is insufficient to make it respon-\nsible for a particular environmental effect\u201d); Sierra \nClub v. FERC, 827 F.3d 36, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (same).   \nPetitioners are wrong, however, to the extent they \nsuggest that the scope of NEPA review should be co-\nextensive with the scope of tort liability\u2014a fictitious \nscope at that, because the federal government is not \nactually liable in tort even for harm proximately \ncaused by its \u201cdiscretionary\u201d decisions, see 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2680(a).  This Court specifically said in Metropolitan \n\n30 \n \nEdison that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d any such \nstrict equivalence with tort liability.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Nor would one make sense in a statute that reg-\nulates the process of agency decisionmaking rather \nthan substantive outcomes.  NEPA is a \u201clook before \nyou leap\u201d statute; properly informed, the agency can \nleap even if it will cause a tort on the way down, and \nit would be incoherent to argue that it can just ignore \nevery consequence that would not be tortious.   \n1.  Petitioners contend that \u201cMetropolitan Edison \nall but resolves this case.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 21-22.  Metropol-\nitan Edison bears little resemblance to this case, par-\nticularly as to the downline effects highlighted by the \nCounty.  While petitioners attempt to wrench a favor-\nable legal standard from the decision, the Court took \npains to explain that it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest\u201d ex-\nactly what petitioners now say it held.  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.   \nIn Metropolitan Edison, this Court concluded that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was not \nrequired to account for the possibility that the risk of \nan accident at Three Mile Island\u2019s nuclear power \nplant \u201cmight cause harm to the psychological health \nand community well-being of residents of the sur-\nrounding area.\u201d  Id. at 768.  As the Court explained, \npsychological health problems were not effects on \u201cthe \nair, land and water,\u201d and were therefore \u201csimply too \nremote from the physical environment to justify re-\nquiring the NRC to evaluate\u201d them.  Id. at 773-774.  \nThe Court further emphasized that any psychological \nhealth effects would stem from the risk of an accident, \nand not from reopening the nuclear plant.  Id. at 775.  \nNEPA, however, \u201cdoes not require agencies to evalu-\nate the effects of risk, qua risk.\u201d  Id. at 779.    \n\n31 \n \nIn explaining that NEPA requires \u201ca reasonably \nclose causal relationship between a change in the \nphysical environment and the effect at issue,\u201d the \nCourt likened this requirement to \u201cthe familiar doc-\ntrine of proximate cause from tort law.\u201d  Id. at 774.  \nThe Court clarified, however, that in \u201cdrawing this \nanalogy,\u201d it \u201cd[id] not mean to suggest that any cause-\neffect relation too attenuated to merit damages in a \ntort suit would also be too attenuated to merit notice \nin an EIS \u2026\u201d  Id. at 774 n.7.  Rather, \u201c[i]n the context \nof both tort law and NEPA, courts must look to the \nunderlying policies or legislative intent in order to \ndraw a manageable line between those causal changes \nthat may make an actor responsible for an effect and \nthose that do not.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Court repeated its reference to \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d in Public Citizen, which involved the suffi-\nciency of NEPA review by the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA) in implementing \nsafety regulations governing Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  541 U.S. at 759-61.  The regulations \nwere prompted by the President\u2019s lifting of a morato-\nrium preventing Mexican trucks from entering the \ncountry; FMCSA was charged with creating a post-\nmoratorium \u201csafety-inspection regime\u201d for these \ntrucks.  Id. at 759-60.  As FMCSA explained, it did not \n\u201cconsider any environmental impact that might be \ncaused by the increased presence of Mexican trucks \nwithin the United States,\u201d as that increase was at-\ntributable to the President\u2019s decision to lift the mora-\ntorium, and not to FMCSA\u2019s implementation of the \nnew safety regulations.  Id. at 761-762.   \nThe Court agreed with the agency\u2019s approach, ex-\nplaining that FMCSA had no \u201cability to countermand \n\n32 \n \nthe President\u2019s lifting of the moratorium or otherwise \ncategorically to exclude Mexican motor carriers from \noperating within the United States.\u201d  Id. at 766.  To \nthe contrary, FMCSA was obligated by statute to reg-\nister any Mexican carrier that was \u201cwilling and able \nto comply with the various substantive requirements \nfor safety and financial responsibility contained in \nDOT regulations.\u201d  Id.   The Court declined to accept \nthe challengers\u2019 \u201cunyielding variation of \u2018but for\u2019 cau-\nsation, where an agency\u2019s action is considered a cause \nof an environmental effect even when the agency has \nno authority to prevent the effect.\u201d  Id. at 767. \n2.  As the Government notes (Br. 34), this Court \nrecognized in Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen \nthat reasonable foreseeability does not extend to the \nlimits of but-for causation.  The Court\u2019s references to \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d just reinforce that an agency need \nnot consider everything from which a project \u201ccould \nconceivably be a but-for cause.\u201d  Sierra Club, 827 F.3d \nat 46; see also Vill. of Bensenville v. FAA, 457 F.3d 52, \n65 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201cEven under NEPA, a \u2018but for\u2019 \ncausal relationship is insufficient to make an agency \nresponsible for a particular effect.\u201d).  \u201cInstead, the ef-\nfect must be \u2018sufficiently likely to occur that a person \nof ordinary prudence would take it into account in \nreaching a decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 47 (quoting City of Shore-\nacres v. Waterworth, 420 F.3d 440, 453 (5th Cir. \n2005)); see supra, pp. 26-28.  \n\u201c[T]he term \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for a \nconcept:  Injuries have countless causes, and not all \nshould give rise to legal liability.\u201d  CSX Transp., Inc. \nv. McBride, 564 U.S. 685, 692 (2011).  The phrase thus \ncaptures \u201cthe policy-based judgment that not all fac-\ntual causes contributing to an injury should be legally \n\n33 \n \ncognizable causes.\u201d  Id. at 701.  Proximate cause has \ntaken \u201cmany shapes,\u201d including both the \u201cconcepts of \ndirect relationship and foreseeability.\u201d  Hemi Grp., \nLLC v. City of N.Y., 559 U.S. 1, 12 (2010).   The use of \nthe phrase \u201cproximate cause\u201d in the NEPA context \nmerely illustrates the well-established principle that \nthe scope of an EIS is not governed by a standard of \nbut-for causation..  See, e.g., Husted v. A. Philip Ran-\ndolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 (2018) (explaining that \n\u201cthe law recognizes several types of causation\u201d and \ndistinguishing \u201cbut-for cause\u201d from \u201cproximate \ncause\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioners latch on to the Court\u2019s reference to \nproximate cause\u2014while failing to mention the Court\u2019s \nfootnote disclaiming the tort-law analogy\u2014and argue \nthat NEPA\u2019s \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d standard turns \non the application of tort law\u2019s proximate cause stand-\nard.  Petrs. Br. 4, 16, 23.  Petitioners push these prin-\nciples to the breaking point by equating NEPA review \nwith the limits of tort liability.  According to Petition-\ners, if \u201crespondents brought a tort claim against STB \non the theory that approving\u201d the Railway \u201cproxi-\nmately caused downline rail accidents\u201d in Colorado, \n\u201cthey would be laughed out of court.\u201d Petrs. Br. 2.  In \nother words, they ask this Court to hold that an \nagency needs to consider an effect during its adminis-\ntrative decisionmaking only if the agency might be \nheld liable in a trial court for any injury arising from \nthat effect.   \nPetitioner seem to be suggesting that NEPA does \nnot require an agency making a decision even to con-\nsider any consequence that the agency will not have \nto pay for in tort damages.  But it is well-established \n\n34 \n \nthat NEPA requires a process, not a particular out-\ncome.  The Board can determine, for example, that the \nrisk of environmental harm is justified by the trans-\nportation benefits of a particular project.  See Robert-\nson, 490 U.S. at 351.  Because the agency\u2019s NEPA ob-\nligation is limited to properly evaluating and account-\ning for the risk of environmental consequences, it \nmakes little sense to apply the same standards that \nwould govern the agency\u2019s liability for a substantive \noutcome if the agency\u2019s substantive decisionmaking \nwere not immunized from tort liability anyway, see su-\npra, p. 30.  \nFor that reason, neither Metropolitan Edison nor \nPublic Citizen held or even suggested that NEPA re-\nview is coextensive with tort liability.  To the contrary, \nas noted, the Court expressly cautioned in Metropoli-\ntan Edison that its invocation of proximate cause did \nnot suggest that \u201cany cause-effect relation too attenu-\nated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an EIS.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774 \nn.7.  Petitioners\u2019 \u201claughed out of court\u201d theory cannot \nbe squared with the statute.5  \n \n5 Petitioners do not go so far as to expressly attempt to divorce \nproximate cause under NEPA from reasonable foreseeability.  \nNor could they, particularly after the BUILDER Act.  While this \nCourt has noted in the damages context that \u201cforeseeability alone \ndoes not ensure the close connection that proximate cause re-\nquires,\u201d these decisions were grounded in concern for unbounded \nmonetary liability.  Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. \n189, 202-03 (2017).  Under NEPA, by contrast, where what is at \nstake is not monetary compensation but well-informed agency \naction, reasonable foreseeability has always been the operative \ntest. \n\n35 \n \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Suggestion That the \u201cRule of \nReason\u201d Allows Agencies to Pass the \nBuck Contradicts NEPA\u2019s Scheme of \nInteragency Cooperation. \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining arguments fall into a cate-\ngory that they call the \u201crule of reason.\u201d  While they try \nto hitch onto references in this Court\u2019s NEPA deci-\nsions, they actually seek to break up the NEPA pro-\ncess into agency-specific silos that the statutory text \nexpressly rejects.  Petitioners contend that \u201creason\u201d \nrequires an agency with statutory authority to con-\nsider environmental consequences not to use it, but to \npass the buck to other agencies based on relative ex-\npertise.  NEPA requires no such thing:  it expressly \ncontemplates a coordinated environmental review \nthat brings all relevant agencies\u2019 expertise to bear in \na single assessment. \n1.  The \u201crule of reason\u201d is not a more stringent ver-\nsion of reasonable foreseeability that an agency can \ninvoke whenever it wishes.  Rather, it serves as a nar-\nrow addendum to the reasonable foreseeability stand-\nard\u2014namely, that where consideration of a particular \neffect \u201cwould serve \u2018no purpose\u2019 in light of NEPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory scheme as a whole,\u201d then the agency is not re-\nquired to consider that effect.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767. \nPublic Citizen provides an apt example.  Applying \nthe \u201crule of reason,\u201d the Court concluded that FMCSA \nwas not required to evaluate the environmental ef-\nfects created by the presence of Mexican trucks in the \nUnited States.  Id. at 768; see also supra, pp. 31-32.  \nFMCSA\u2019s decision-making process was constrained:  \nit had no power to just refuse to carry out its statutory \n\n36 \n \ntask because it thought the environmental conse-\nquences too grave.  Id.  In that unique circumstance, \nrequiring FMCSA to study this impact would not \nserve NEPA\u2019s goal to \u201cprovid[e] a springboard for pub-\nlic comment in the agency decisionmaking process.\u201d  \nId. at 768 (internal quotations omitted).  FMCSA had \nno ability to provide a \u201clarger audience\u201d with the op-\nportunity for meaningful input when FMCSA had no \nauthority to \u201cact on whatever input this \u2018larger audi-\nence\u2019 could provide.\u201d  Id. at 769.   \nHere, by contrast, it is \u201cconceded[]\u201d that the \nBoard\u2019s \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the construction \nand operation of the railway\u201d includes the \u201cauthority \nto deny the exemption petition if the environmental \nharm caused by the railway outweighs its transporta-\ntion benefits.\u201d  Pet.App.36a.  While agencies need not \nconsider effects on which their decisions have no bear-\ning, an agency with authority to weigh environmental \nconsequences in deciding whether to approve of a fed-\neral action does have authority to prevent any harm \nthat would flow from that project.  \nPetitioners twist the rule of reason into something \ndifferent, to argue that even if the Board has authority \nto consider environmental consequences, it has no ob-\nligation to learn what those consequences may be be-\nfore exercising that authority.  Petitioners contend \nthat the issues in this case are \u201cfar outside [the \nBoard\u2019s] limited remit, but well within the purview of \nother agencies\u2019 authority,\u201d and urge that \u201cthose other \nagencies can address such issues more comprehen-\nsively.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 26.  Much like Petitioners\u2019 proxi-\nmate cause theory, it is not clear how far Petitioners \nbelieve this rule should extend.  As the Government \nnotes, if Petitioners are merely repeating the holding \n\n37 \n \nof Public Citizen, then that is a noncontroversial \nstatement of governing law:  NEPA requires agencies \nto assess the effects of their actions, not effects they \nhave no authority to control.  See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023); Gov\u2019t Br. 31.  But petitioners are \nwrong to the extent they suggest that NEPA imposes \na \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d limitation (Petrs. Br. 24)\u2014\ni.e., that agencies need only evaluate effects they are \ndirectly charged with regulating.6 \nA \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d approach is squarely in-\nconsistent with NEPA, which requires extensive in-\nteragency cooperation.  See supra, pp. 6-7.  The stat-\nute expressly states that the agency leading the EIS \nprocess \u201cshall consult with and obtain the comments \nof any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or \nspecial expertise with respect to any environmental \nimpact involved.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023).  \nNEPA thus envisions that multiple federal, state, and \nlocal agencies will have separate or overlapping juris-\ndiction over aspects of the effects at issue, and will col-\nlectively participate in the EIS process under the lead \nof a single agency\u2014precisely as occurred here.  \nJ.A.111-114; C.A.App.823-825.  The EIS process does \nnot require an agency to stray far outside its exper-\ntise; rather, the lead agency has the authority to ask \ncooperating agencies to assume responsibility for as-\npects of the environmental analysis, particularly in \nareas for \u201cwhich the cooperating agency has special \nexpertise.\u201d  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.8(b)(3).   \n \n6 The question presented asks whether an agency must study ef-\nfects \u201cbeyond the proximate effects of the action over which the \nagency has regulatory authority.\u201d  Pet. i (emphasis added).  After \nthe question presented, however, petitioners\u2019 brief never again \nuses the phrase \u201cregulatory authority.\u201d      \n\n38 \n \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be squared with \nthis federal scheme.  It is the rare federal action that \ndoes not involve impacts cutting across agency lines.  \nIn every other case, several agencies will have juris-\ndiction and expertise over the effects of an action be-\ning taken by one of those agencies.  To the extent pe-\ntitioners suggest that a project should involve multi-\nple EIS processes, one for each involved agency, that \nwill lead to more process and more paperwork\u2014the \nprecise opposite of what petitioners believe should \nhappen.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remake of NEPA would mean that an \nagency can excise from consideration any effects that \nit deems more directly regulated by another agency.  \nAn agency would no have no obligation to consider, for \nexample, a project\u2019s effects on water and air, because \nthose domains fall within the jurisdiction of the EPA.  \nAnd an agency like STB would find itself with no \nNEPA obligations all\u2014notwithstanding the statutory \ncommand that \u201call agencies of the Federal Govern-\nment shall\u201d comply with the requirement to evaluate \nthe environmental effects of their actions.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 4332(2)(C) (2023). \n3.  Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, \n490 U.S. 332 (1989), is not to the contrary.  While not \nclear from petitioners\u2019 distorted description (Petrs. Br. \n24), Robertson primarily resolved whether NEPA re-\nquires an EIS to include \u201ca fully developed plan to mit-\nigate environmental harm.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at \n335-336.  The Court answered in the negative, ex-\nplaining in part that it will sometimes be infeasible \nfor an EIS to include \u201ca complete mitigation plan,\u201d in-\ncluding when certain effects (there, \u201coff-site effects on \nair quality and on the mule deer herd\u201d) could not be \n\n39 \n \nmitigated \u201cunless nonfederal government agencies \ntake appropriate action.\u201d  Id. at 352.  Because state \nand local authorities had jurisdiction over the rele-\nvant area and authority to mitigate the effects, it \nwould make little sense to conclude that the Forest \nService had \u201cno power to act until the local agencies \nha[d] reached a final conclusion on what mitigation \nmeasures they consider[ed] necessary.\u201d  Id. at 352-\n353.  \nThe decision in no way suggests that the Forest \nService could ignore these effects in its EIS.  To the \ncontrary, petitioners\u2019 quoted portion of the decision \nextols the values of a robust EIS, and the discussion \nof these effects in particular that the Forest Service \ndid not directly regulate.  Because \u201cthe adverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd [were] primarily \nattributable to predicted off-site development that \nw[ould] be subject to regulation by other governmen-\ntal bodies,\u201d a fulsome EIS served the purpose of \u201coffer-\ning those bodies adequate notice of the expected con-\nsequences and the opportunity to plan and implement \ncorrective measures in a timely manner.\u201d  Id. at 350.7  \n \n7 The Court separately rejected the argument that the agency \nwas required to consider the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario when as-\nsessing the environmental impact of a project.  490 U.S. at 354.  \nPetitioners\u2019 description notwithstanding, the case is not an ex-\nample of NEPA run amok.  As the Court\u2019s decision explains, prior \nCEQ regulations had provided that if an agency was unable to \nobtain certain data relevant to its evaluation, the agency instead \nhad to include a \u201cworst case analysis and an indication of the \nprobability or improbability of its occurrence.\u201d  Id. (quoting 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 1502.22 (1985)).  That regulation had been replaced by \nthe time of the review at issue in Robertson, and the Court disa-\ngreed with the court of appeals that the \u201cworst case\u201d requirement \nnonetheless still controlled.  490 U.S. at 354.  \n\n40 \n \n*  *  * \nNEPA is critical to ensuring that the public is in-\nformed about the potential environmental effects of an \nagency action.  The scope of NEPA evaluation thus \nturns on the information that an ordinary prudent \nperson would take into account when deciding \nwhether to proceed with a particular action. This \nstandard accords with the governing regulations, with \na consistent and extensive body of circuit caselaw, \nand, most fundamentally, with NEPA\u2019s animating \npurpose.  \nIII. The D.C. Circuit Correctly Identified \nMultiple Errors in the Board\u2019s NEPA \nReasoning, All Regarding Foreseeable \nEffects of the Railway.  \nThe environmental consequences of doubling the \ntrain traffic on the UP Line\u2014by adding lengthy trains \nfilled with crude oil, which will run right next to the \nColorado River\u2014fit any definition of reasonable fore-\nseeability.  More trains mean more sparks (and more \nwildfires) and more accidents.  The agency was re-\nquired to take a hard look at those consequences.  In-\ndeed, while the agency contended that it had taken a \nhard look, the agency did not disagree that it was re-\nquired to take one.  Nor did petitioners, at least not in \ntheir petition for certiorari.  Petitioners\u2019 belated at-\ntempt to dismiss these effects as too attenuated does \nnot square with the record or the law.    \n\n41 \n \nA. The Board Failed to Take the Requisite \nHard Look at a Series of Downline \nEnvironmental Effects.  \nPetitioners\u2019 caricature bears no resemblance to the \nactual D.C. Circuit fact-specific decision.  Far from de-\nmanding \u201cbottomless process,\u201d Petrs. Br. 43, the court \nrejected many of the challenges to the EIS.  \nPet.App.37a-39a, 48a-50a.  But for a couple of key \ndownline impacts\u2014wildfires, water contamination, \nand derailments of oil-bearing trains\u2014the court found \nthe EIS lacking.  While petitioners now suggest that \nthese downline impacts were not sufficiently foresee-\nable, neither the parties nor the Board nor the court \nof appeals saw it that way.  Rather, all agreed that \nthese impacts were reasonably foreseeable and \nneeded to be evaluated.  Petitioners\u2019 attempt to dis-\nmiss wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills as \ncategorically off the table completely fails to grapple \nwith the actual facts before the D.C. Circuit.  And pe-\ntitioners\u2019 contention that the court of appeals violated \nthe \u201crule of reason\u201d just confirms that petitioners are \nusing that term to encompass essentially anything in \na NEPA case that petitioners do not like. \n1. The Board\u2019s consideration of the \ndownline wildfire impact was \u201cutterly \nunreasoned.\u201d  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained, the Board\u2019s conclu-\nsion that wildfire impact \u201cwould not be significant\u201d \n(J.A.285) suffered from two major errors.  First, the \nBoard decided that adding 9.5 new trains a day to the \nUP Line would not significantly increase the risk of \nwildfires because these trains \u201cwould not be a quali-\ntatively \u2018new ignition source.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.44a.  In other \nwords, because the UP Line is currently host to some \n\n42 \n \n(low) number of trains, adding more trains would not \nincrease the risk of wildfires.  That conclusion is, as \nthe D.C. Circuit put it, \u201cutterly unreasoned.\u201d  Id.  \nMore trains mean more ignition sources; more igni-\ntion sources mean more sparks; and more sparks \nmean more wildfires.  See J.A.282-283; supra, p. 11.  \nRegardless of whether new trains are a new type of \nignition source, they are undoubtedly new ignition \nsources\u2014and \u201c[a] significant increase in the frequency \nof which existing ignition sources travel this route \nequally poses an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Pet.App.44a-\n45a.  Indeed, OEA itself repeatedly recognized in \nother sections of the EIS that \u201cmore trains could in-\ncrease the risk of sparking a wildfire.\u201d  J.A.259, 280.   \nA second mistake exacerbated this error.  The \nBoard reasoned that \u201ctrains make up a small percent-\nage of fire starts\u201d based on pre-2015 data from Utah, \nand concluded that \u201cthe probability that a train would \ntrigger a wildfire is very low.\u201d  J.A.284-285.  As the \nD.C. Circuit explained, however, that fails to grapple \nwith the \u201cconcededly \u2018low volume of rail traffic\u2019 on the \nUnion Pacific Line currently.\u201d  Pet.App.45a.   \n2. The Board entirely failed to address \nadverse impacts on the Colorado \nRiver.   \nFully half of the downline UP Line parallels the \n\u201csensitive\u201d Colorado River.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  Yet nei-\nther the Final EIS nor the Board\u2019s discussion of im-\npacts on water resources even mentioned the River.  \nPet.App.46a.  The Board conceded as much below, and \nconspicuously did not argue that impacts on the river \nare beyond the scope of a proper NEPA analysis.   \n\n43 \n \nInstead, on appeal it contended that it had done \nthe work, just by other means\u2014it had reviewed wa-\nterways in Utah, and its counsel posited that the im-\npacts to downline waterways would be \u201cthe same\u201d in \nColorado.  Pet.App.46a; see also C.A.App.906-911, \n939-948.  But that appears nowhere in the EIS or the \nBoard\u2019s approval decision, see Pet.App.46a-47a, and \nthe APA is not satisfied by the \u201cpost hoc rationaliza-\ntions\u201d by \u201cappellate counsel[].\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983). \nThe Colorado River, the \u201cmost important river in \nthe Southwest United States,\u201d raises unique consider-\nations.  J.A.8-9, 23-24.  Despite that, there \u201cis no evi-\ndence\u201d that the \u201cBoard even considered the potential \nimpacts on water resources downline of running up to \n9.5 loaded oil trains a day on the Union Pacific Line.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  Nor did the Board reconcile its conclu-\nsion with its finding that there would be \u201cmajor im-\npacts\u201d on Utah waterways from the Railway\u2019s con-\nstruction and operations, requiring significant mitiga-\ntion measures.  J.A.121-122, 240-242; C.A.App.1168.  \nIf the analysis really did apply equally to Colorado, \nthe Board needed to examine the corresponding \u201cma-\njor impacts\u201d on Colorado waterways.   \n3. The Board erred in assessing the \nimpact of train accidents.   \nThe shipment of crude oil poses serious risks.  \nJ.A.49-50.  In 2018, the federal Pipeline and Hazard-\nous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) re-\nported to Congress that the safety record of crude oil \nshipments by rail has been highly variable based on \ncertain \u201chigh-impact incidents.\u201d  J.A.49-50 (quoting \n\n44 \n \nU.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., PHMSA, Report on Shipping \nCrude Oil by Truck, Rail and Pipeline, at 7, Fig. 3 \n(Oct. 2018), https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/report-\ncongress-shipping-crude-oil-truck-rail-and-pipeline).  \nAs the County put it:  \u201c[W]hen things go wrong with \nshipments of crude oil by rail, they go dramatically \nwrong.\u201d  J.A.50.     \nOEA accordingly recognized that downline rail ac-\ncidents could have a range of significant impacts, \namong them the release of toxic crude oil on land or \ninto the adjacent Colorado River and the possibility of \nstarting a fire.  J.A.199-201, 220-222.  But its assess-\nment of the accident rate was incorrect.    \nTo model the accident rate based on the increase \nin rail traffic on the Union Pacific Line, the Board \nused the national average of derailment accidents, \nwith no consideration of the location of the trains (the \nhighly variable and steep terrain of the Rocky Moun-\ntains) or their cargo (heavy crude oil).  C.A.App.1340.  \nNor did the EIS address the unique derailment risks \nposed by the particular trains that would be traveling \non the UP Line\u2014 \u201cheavy, long unit trains that would \nexclusively transport crude oil.\u201d  C.A.App.1340-1341. \nThe Board did not dispute these unique risks, but \ndisclaimed responsibility on the basis that \u201c[i]nsuffi-\ncient data were found on accident rates for unit trains \ncarrying crude oil.\u201d  J.A.519.  That does not cut it un-\nder NEPA, which expressly contemplates that agen-\ncies will sometimes have insufficient data available.  \nIf an agency lacks \u201cinformation relevant to reasonably \nforeseeable significant effects,\u201d the EIS must include \na \u201csummary of existing credible scientific evidence\u201d on \nthis topic, and the \u201cagency\u2019s evaluation of such effects \n\n45 \n \nbased upon theoretical approaches or research meth-\nods generally accepted in the scientific community.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.21(c). \nThe Board did not engage in any of this analysis:  \nIt \u201cconcededly relied on national freight train accident \nrates without explanation and assumed that loaded \nfreight trains were as likely to derail as unloaded \ntrains.\u201d  Pet.App.42a; see supra, pp. 10, 14.  Because \nthe Board \u201cfailed to respond to significant opposing \nviewpoints concerning the adequacy of its analyses of\u201d \nrail accidents, the D.C. Circuit correctly found its \nanalysis \u201cdeficient.\u201d  Pet.App.42a.    \nB. Petitioners Do Not Meaningfully \nChallenge the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Analysis of \nThese Downline Impacts.  \nPetitioners raise a set of scattershot arguments to \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s review of downline impacts.  None \nis persuasive.  \n1.  Petitioners first attempt to wave away all of the \nchallenges to the Board\u2019s approval on the basis that \nthey were too attenuated to merit consideration.  \nPetrs. Br. 13-14.  The County and the environmental \nchallengers objected to the EIS\u2019s treatment of several \ndifferent effects, among them the impact of oil refining \non the Gulf Coast; the potential effects of construction, \ndrilling, and truck traffic in the Uinta Basin; and \ndownline impacts involving rail accidents, wildfires, \nand water resources in Colorado.  Petrs. Br. 13-14; see \nsupra, pp. 41-45.  According to petitioners, the Board \nprovided a single, collective response to all of the ob-\njections\u2014namely, that it \u201cdid not need to consider \nthose far-downstream (or down-track) potentialities, \n\n46 \n \nall of which lay outside STB\u2019s limited remit,\u201d and none \nof which it could \u201caccurately predict.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 14. \nThat is a significant rewrite of the record.  For the \ndownline impacts addressed above, the Board in fact \nsaid the opposite.  As the Board recognized in its ap-\nproval decision, OEA examined a set of \u201creasonably \nforeseeable impacts that could occur outside the pro-\nject area as a result of construction and/or operation \nof trains using the Line\u201d (i.e., \u201cdownline impacts\u201d).  \nPet.App.110a.  OEA was able to assess these impacts \nprecisely because there were a \u201cpredicted number and \nlength of trains,\u201d a set of \u201clikely regional destinations\u201d \nand \u201cprojected reasonably foreseeable routes for this \ntraffic.\u201d  Pet.App.111a.  Taken together, this infor-\nmation allowed OEA to identify \u201ca downline impact \nstudy area eastward from Kyune to the northern, \nsouthern, \nand \neastern \nedges \nof \nthe \nDenver \nMetro/North Front range that met the Board\u2019s regula-\ntory thresholds for analysis.\u201d  Id.  This downline study \narea was defined in reference to Board regulations \nthat specify precisely when the Board must evaluate \ndownline impacts.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1105.7(e); supra, \npp. 8-9.  In other words, the downline impacts the \nBoard addressed made their way into consideration \nprecisely because they were reasonably foreseeable \nand had a sufficiently close causal relationship with \napproval of the Railway.   \n2.  Petitioners separately suggest that the in-\ncreased risk of downline train accidents does not re-\nsult in an environmental effect, and therefore does not \nfall within NEPA\u2019s ambit. Petrs. Br. 40-41.  According \nto petitioners, an accident might not \u201chave any mean-\ningful impact on the \u2018air, land and water,\u2019\u201d and there-\nfore would not pose an environmental risk that STB \n\n47 \n \nmust review under NEPA.  Petrs. Br. 40.  This argu-\nment fails several times over.  \nTo start, petitioners do not suggest the other two \ndownline impacts (the risk of wildfires and the impact \non the Colorado River) are not environmental.  Nor \ncould they:  these are clearly effects on the \u201cair, land \nand water\u201d that fall within the heartland of environ-\nmental risks.  Metro. Edison, 460 U.S. at 773, 775 (de-\nscribing \u201cincreased fog\u201d and \u201cthe release of warm wa-\nter into the Susquehanna River\u201d as direct environ-\nmental effects).  Thus, even assuming the risk of acci-\ndents is not an environmental effect, that does not call \ninto question the D.C. Circuit\u2019s conclusions that the \nBoard failed to conduct the requisite \u201chard look\u201d with \nrespect to downline impacts on wildfires and water re-\nsources.      \nPetitioners are also wrong that rail accidents that \nresult from adding the Railway and its oil-bearing \ntrains to the rail network are not an environmental \nimpact.  OEA itself describes the range of environ-\nmental consequences that could result from a rail ac-\ncident, whether on the Railroad or downline.  J.A.199-\n200, 220-222; see also supra, pp. 10-12.  Among other \noutcomes, \u201c[t]rain accidents or derailments could \ncause train cars to rupture or overturn and spill crude \noil or frac sand into the environment.\u201d  J.A.220.  \n\u201cUinta Basin crude oil is toxic, and an accidental re-\nlease would have negative effects on the environ-\nment.\u201d  J.A.221.  \u201cIf an accident were to release crude \noil near a waterway\u201d\u2014for example, the adjacent Col-\norado River\u2014\u201ccrude oil could enter the waterway, \nwhich would affect water quality.\u201d  J.A.199.  And \u201c[i]f \n\n48 \n \nthe force of the accident were sufficient to ignite the \ncrude oil, a fire could result.\u201d  J.A.200.8   \nPetitioners\u2019 respond that an accident is not certain \nto result in an environmental effect: a train might be \n\u201cunloaded or carrying innocuous cargo,\u201d resulting in \n\u201ca safety risk for the Federal Railway Administration \nto consider substantively\u2014but not an environmental \nrisk for STB to review under the auspices of NEPA.\u201d  \nPetrs. Br. 40.  The EIS, however, reports that on the \nUnion Pacific line, \u201caccidents involving a loaded crude \noil train would occur slightly less than once per year \nunder the high rail traffic scenario\u201d\u2014with a spill oc-\ncurring every four years.  J.A.202 (emphasis added).9  \nThese spills are concrete, predictable, environmental \neffects\u2014the core of what NEPA directs agencies to \nstudy.  Petitioners attempt to brush away these \n\u201cdownline accidents actually affecting the physical en-\nvironment\u201d as \u201cvanishingly narrow and remote,\u201d but \nroughly one accident per year involving a loaded crude \n \n8 Petitioners also obliquely suggest that the Railway would not \nproximately cause downline train accidents.  See Petrs. Br. 40.  \nThe Board did not see it that way:  It calculated a specific risk of \naccidents based on the increased train traffic, and then pro-\nceeded to evaluate the effects of those accidents.  See supra, \npp. 10-12.   \n9 Petitioners state that, \u201calthough STB estimated that marginal \nincreases in rail traffic could cause 0.89 new accidents per year, \naccidents involving a loaded crude train would occur far less fre-\nquently.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 15.  That is simply wrong:  \u201cOEA predicts \nthat accidents involving a loaded crude oil train would occur \nslightly less than once per year under the high rail traffic sce-\nnario.\u201d  J.A.203.  \n\n49 \n \noil train is hardly \u201cvanishingly narrow.\u201d  Petrs. Br. \n40.10 \nNor is an evaluation of these impacts comparable \nto the evaluation of \u201crisk, qua risk\u201d that the Court re-\njected in Metropolitan Edison.  Petrs. Br. 41.  There \nwas no question that the NRC needed to evaluate \u201cef-\nfects that will occur if\u201d the risk of a nuclear accident \nwere realized.  460 U.S. at 775 n.9.  Rather, NRC was \nnot required \u201cto evaluate the effects of risk, qua risk\u201d\u2014\ni.e., the psychological health effects engendered by \nconcerns about risk.  Id. at 779 (first emphasis added). \nEven putting all of that aside, the Board treated \nthe risk of rail accidents as an environmental effect \nthat it needed to evaluate under NEPA.  J.A.198 (dis-\ncussing the \u201c[e]nvironmental [c]onsequences\u201d of rail \naccidents).  The Board\u2019s decision cannot be upheld on \nthe theory\u2014entirely at odds with the Board\u2019s actual \nanalysis\u2014that these were non-environmental im-\npacts that it had no obligation to study under NEPA.  \nSee SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943).  \n3.  Finally, petitioners describe the D.C. Circuit as \ninvoking \u201ca rule of bottomless process, not a rule of \nreason.\u201d  Petrs. Br. 43.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 mis-\ncharacterization, the court of appeals did not require \nthe Board to do just one more study.  Rather, it called \nout, correctly, glaring errors in the Board\u2019s analysis.  \nWhatever boundaries the rule of reason puts around \na NEPA study, it does not shield arbitrary deci-\n \n10 Petitioners\u2019 approach would have required the Board to ig-\nnore (as \u201cnot environmental\u201d) not just downline accidents, but \naccidents on the proposed Railway itself.  See J.A.222 (Board \nforecasting the accident rate on the Railway).  \n\n50 \n \nsionmaking on matters within that boundary.  \u201cRea-\nson\u201d does not support excluding agencies cannot ex-\ncuse themselves from the ordinary APA requirement \nof reasoned decisionmaking.  In other words, the \nBoard did not need to \u201cgo[] further\u201d\u2014it needed to \navoid relying on false premises and plainly inaccurate \ndata.   \nThe Board determined, correctly, that these down-\nline impacts were reasonably foreseeable.  See supra, \npp. 10-11.  It was therefore required to evaluate them \nunder the legal standard that all parties agree ap-\nplies.  It could not satisfy this requirement through a \nseries of deeply flawed determinations.  \n*  *  * \nThis Court is used to hearing litigants say that \ntheir adversaries\u2019 policy arguments would be better \naddressed to Congress.  This case is unusual because \nCongress has already addressed those arguments, in \nan amendment after the relevant agency action that \nis only indirectly before the Court here.  And it is even \nmore unusual because the answer to the question pre-\nsented cannot affect the outcome of this particular \ncase given the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision on the County\u2019s \n\u201chard look\u201d claims.  And because the agency will have \nto re-do its NEPA analysis, the agency may well take \ninto account the amended statute if it chooses\u2014\nwhether this Court resolves the question presented in \nthe agency\u2019s favor or not.   \nTo try to avoid those consequences, petitioners \nhave substantially reconfigured their arguments be-\ntween the certiorari and merits stages in an attempt \nto convince this Court to reach well beyond the ques-\ntion presented.  But there is no occasion for the Court \n\n51 \n \nto do so.  Petitioners\u2019 merits arguments are not only \nincorrect, they are also completely disconnected from \nany division in the courts of appeals that they pre-\nsented at the certiorari stage.  And because this case \ninvolves the pre-amendment version of NEPA, it can \nshed light on the current statute only indirectly.  \nGiven the likelihood that a decision will neither affect \nthe outcome of this case nor clarify the law, the court \nmay wish to simply dismiss the writ as improvidently \ngranted. \nCONCLUSION \nIf the Court does not dismiss the writ, the judg-\nment should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nNATHANIEL H.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case remains centered on the formidable coalition arguing for reversal and the compelling legal framework provided by the Solicitor General (SG). The core of my belief is that the petitioners, the State of Utah, the SG, and the Surface Transportation Board (STB) itself have presented a strong, unified front. The SG's \"rule of reason\" framework, grounded in the controlling precedent of *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen*, offers the Court a moderate and precedented path to reverse the D.C. Circuit. This path allows the Court to reject the D.C. Circuit's expansive \"reasonable foreseeability\" standard without adopting the petitioners' potentially over-broad \"proximate cause\" test, instead reaffirming principles of agency deference and the linkage between NEPA scope and statutory authority.\n\nThe new observation provides no new external evidence about the case itself. Instead, it is an internal metacognitive check that formally updates my belief state by highlighting a critical and now-quantified knowledge gap. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Formalization of a Critical Knowledge Gap:** My understanding of the legal arguments in this case is confirmed to be entirely one-sided. I have a robust model of the arguments for reversal but possess zero information regarding the substantive arguments from the respondents, Eagle County. This observation moves the lack of respondent arguments from a noted uncertainty to a formally identified, critical deficiency in my task beliefs (\u03b8).\n\n2.  **Increased Salience of Counter-Arguments:** The observation solidifies that my primary predictive uncertainty is the content of the respondents' brief on the merits. To make a robust prediction, I must understand:\n    *   How Eagle County distinguishes the facts of this case from the precedent of *Public Citizen*.\n    *   What legal framework they advocate for as an alternative to the \"rule of reason\" or \"proximate cause.\"\n    *   How they justify the D.C. Circuit's \"reasonable foreseeability\" standard as being consistent with Supreme Court precedent and NEPA's statutory purpose.\n\n3.  **Qualification of Confidence:** While my assessment of the strength of the petitioners' and SG's arguments remains unchanged, my overall confidence in a prediction of reversal is now formally tempered. The current belief state is analogous to hearing only the prosecution's case in a trial. The arguments for reversal appear very strong, but their resilience is untested against the direct counter-arguments they are meant to defeat. The probability of reversal remains high based on the available information, but the variance around that probability has increased until the respondents' position is known. My model of the case is incomplete, and this observation serves as a formal acknowledgment of that incompleteness, preventing overconfidence based on a biased information set.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My previous belief state was defined by a one-sided understanding of the case, centered on the formidable arguments for reversal presented by the petitioners, the State of Utah, and the Solicitor General (SG). I had identified a critical knowledge gap: the complete absence of the respondents' substantive arguments. The new observation, the brief for respondent Eagle County, has filled this gap, fundamentally altering my model of the case and decreasing my confidence in a straightforward reversal.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondents' Core Framework\u2014Defending the Status Quo:** The central thrust of Eagle County's argument is that the D.C. Circuit's decision was not a radical departure but a standard application of long-standing NEPA principles. They argue that the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard has been the consensus view in the courts of appeals for decades and, most critically, was recently codified by Congress in the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. This frames the petitioners' and SG's proposed \"proximate cause\" or \"rule of reason\" tests not as a clarification, but as an attempt to have the judiciary impose limits on NEPA that Congress itself just considered and declined to adopt.\n\n2.  **Direct Rebuttal of Key Precedents:** Eagle County directly confronts the precedents that formed the core of my prior beliefs:\n    *   ***Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen***: They distinguish this case by focusing on agency authority. In *Public Citizen*, the agency (FMCSA) had no authority to deny Mexican trucks entry into the U.S., making the environmental effects of that entry irrelevant to its decision. Here, Eagle County argues the Surface Transportation Board (STB) *does* have the authority to \"deny the[] exemption petition if the environmental harm caused by the railway outweighs its transportation benefits.\" Therefore, the downline effects (wildfires, oil spills) are directly material to the STB's decision, making *Public Citizen*'s limitation inapplicable.\n    *   ***Metropolitan Edison Co. v. PANE***: They neutralize this precedent by arguing it is about a fundamentally different issue. *Metropolitan Edison* held that NEPA does not require analysis of non-physical, psychological harms (fear of a nuclear accident). Eagle County contrasts this with the current case, which involves \"classic, foreseeable environmental effects such as wildfires, water contamination, and oil spills.\" They also highlight that *Metropolitan Edison* itself explicitly stated it was *not* reading a tort-liability limit into NEPA, directly undermining the petitioners' push for a proximate cause standard derived from tort law.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Scope of NEPA Analysis:** The respondents reject the petitioners' \"pass-the-buck\" theory\u2014that an agency can ignore effects if another agency has some jurisdiction over them. Instead, they argue that NEPA's text and regulations establish a detailed scheme of *inter-agency collaboration* (lead and cooperating agencies). This structure presupposes that the lead agency will consider effects outside its core expertise by consulting with other agencies, which is precisely what the STB did by working with four other federal agencies. This recasts the petitioners' argument as being contrary to NEPA's explicit procedural design.\n\n4.  **Introduction of a Procedural Off-Ramp:** Eagle County introduces a significant new element by suggesting the Court could dismiss the writ as improvidently granted (DIG). They argue that the D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate rested on multiple, case-specific findings of agency error (e.g., the wildfire analysis was \"utterly unreasoned,\" the Board failed to address Colorado River impacts). They contend that even if the Supreme Court were to adopt the petitioners' legal standard, the judgment would stand on these independent grounds. This provides an off-ramp for the Court to avoid making a broad ruling on NEPA, which may be attractive to some Justices.\n\n5.  **Revised Assessment of Case Dynamics and Confidence:** My confidence in a reversal has been substantially reduced. The respondents have presented a robust, text-based defense of the D.C. Circuit's ruling that is grounded in recent congressional action. The legal battle is no longer a one-sided push for reversal but a balanced contest between two competing visions of NEPA: the petitioners' view, which seeks to import limiting principles from tort law and agency-specific statutes, and the respondents' view, which defends the traditional, materiality-based \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard now codified in the statute itself. The strength of the respondents' arguments, particularly the recent congressional action and the potential DIG off-ramp, significantly increases the probability of an affirmance or dismissal.",

This action\u2014searching for the petitioners' reply brief\u2014is the only way to acquire this information. Therefore, the action has the maximum possible Task EIG (1.0) as it directly targets the single most critical, identified knowledge gap. The potential for a significant posterior update is immense; a strong reply could revive the chances of reversal, while a weak one would cement my belief in an affirmance or DIG. The Design EIG is also high (0.7) because this is a classic test of a core principle in SCOTUS prediction: evaluating the strategic importance of the reply brief. Observing how a petitioner attempts to salvage their case against powerful, late-stage arguments provides a crucial, generalizable data point on the persuasive weight and function of this specific document in the litigation lifecycle.",

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explain\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been significantly refined. While my previous beliefs captured the substance of the respondents' arguments, this synthesis has crystallized the central points of contention and clarified the remaining uncertainty. My model of the case is no longer just a list of competing arguments, but a structured view of the two primary battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondents' Core Framework\u2014Defending the Status Quo (Stable):** Eagle County's central argument remains that the D.C. Circuit's decision was a standard application of the long-standing \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard for NEPA analysis. The most powerful element of this argument is that Congress recently codified this very standard in the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), making the petitioners' request for a new \"proximate cause\" test an invitation for the Court to judicially override a recent legislative judgment.\n\n2.  **Direct Rebuttal of Key Precedents (Stable):** The respondents' distinction of *Department of Transp. v. Public Citizen* (based on the STB's authority to deny the project on environmental grounds) and their neutralization of *Metropolitan Edison Co. v. PANE* (physical vs. non-physical harms) remain critical components of their defense. They effectively argue that the petitioners are misapplying precedent to import a tort-law \"proximate cause\" standard that the Court itself has previously declined to read into NEPA.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Scope of NEPA Analysis (Stable):** The respondents' argument that NEPA's structure anticipates and manages effects outside a lead agency's core jurisdiction through inter-agency collaboration (as the STB did with four other agencies) continues to be a strong counter to the petitioners' theory that an agency can ignore effects overseen by other regulators.\n\n4.  **Crystallization of the Two Decisive Battlegrounds (New Synthesis):** My analysis has now synthesized the complex arguments into two primary, potentially dispositive issues:\n    *   **The Statutory Interpretation Clash:** This is the core merits question. It pits the petitioners' and SG's proposed \"proximate cause\" or \"rule of reason\" standard\u2014derived from judicial precedent like *Public Citizen*\u2014against the respondents' \"reasonably foreseeable\" effects standard, which they argue is not only the historical consensus but is now explicitly endorsed by Congress in the 2023 FRA. The case may turn on whether the Court sees this as clarifying its own precedent or as supplanting a recent act of Congress.\n    *   **The Procedural Off-Ramp:** The possibility of a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) has been elevated from a secondary point to a co-equal potential outcome. The respondents' argument is that the D.C. Circuit's judgment rests on multiple independent and case-specific grounds (e.g., the STB's \"utterly unreasoned\" wildfire analysis). If the Court agrees, it could DIG the case to avoid making a broad ruling on NEPA, especially given the new statutory landscape created by the FRA.\n\n5.  **Revised Assessment and Identification of Critical Uncertainty:** My confidence in a reversal remains significantly lower than it was initially. The case is now framed as a direct conflict between judicial precedent and recent congressional action. The strength of the respondents' arguments on both the merits (the FRA) and procedure (the DIG) makes an affirmance or dismissal a highly plausible outcome. The most critical knowledge gap is now precisely defined: **how will the petitioners, in their reply brief, counter the two most powerful arguments against them?** Specifically, I need to know their response to the claim that the 2023 FRA has codified the respondents' standard and their rebuttal to the argument that the case should be dismissed as improvidently granted. The petitioners' reply brief is the single most important piece of evidence remaining to finalize my predictive model.",

This is a direct counter to the respondents' main statutory argument. 2) The SG's explicit rejection of a rigid tort-law 'proximate cause' standard, which distances the government's position from the petitioners' and offers the Court a more moderate path to reversal. 3) The SG's proposed 'manageable, context-specific' standard, rooted in a 'rule of reason,' which seems designed to be an attractive, flexible standard for a majority of the Court. 4) The SG's recommendation to 'remand to the court of appeals' after deciding the legal question, which provides a clear procedural off-ramp and significantly diminishes the likelihood of a DIG.

This brief doesn't just echo the petitioners; it carves out a distinct, moderate legal standard ('rule of reason') and provides a clear procedural path (remand, not DIG). Synthesizing this information, as outlined in the thought process, is essential. It fundamentally reshapes the predictive model by significantly increasing the probability of reversal, decreasing the probability of a DIG, and, most importantly, refining the central uncertainty from *whether* the court will reverse to *which standard* it will adopt for reversal. This is a massive leap in understanding the case's likely outcome.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action provides a powerful, generalizable lesson for SCOTUS prediction. It demonstrates the critical design principle of how to process and weight an SG brief, especially one that offers a 'middle way' solution. The process of mapping the SG's arguments onto existing uncertainties, resolving some while creating new, more nuanced ones, is a textbook example of effective Bayesian belief updating in this domain. This reinforces the meta-strategy that the SG's position is not just another data point but a potential blueprint for the Court's majority opinion, and an effective agent must model it as such.",

My model of the case is no longer just a list of competing arguments, but a structured view of the two primary battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome. The observation of the Solicitor General's (SG) reply brief, filed in support of the petitioners, directly addresses my previously identified critical uncertainties and substantially reshapes my predictive model.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondents' Core Framework\u2014Defending the Status Quo (Stable but Weakened):** Eagle County's central argument remains that the D.C. Circuit's decision was a standard application of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard, which they argue was codified by Congress in the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA). This belief remains stable as the core of the respondents' case. However, its persuasive power is now significantly weakened by the SG's direct rebuttal, which argues that the FRA did not abrogate this Court's precedents (*Metropolitan Edison*, *Public Citizen*) that require a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" in addition to foreseeability.\n\n2.  **Direct Rebuttal of Key Precedents (Stable):** The respondents' arguments distinguishing *Public Citizen* and *Metropolitan Edison* remain a key part of their defense. The SG's brief engages with these same precedents but interprets them differently, reinforcing my view that the case will turn on the Court's interpretation of its own prior rulings on NEPA causation.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Scope of NEPA Analysis (Stable):** The respondents' argument about inter-agency collaboration remains a valid point, but the SG's brief reframes the issue as one of agency discretion under a \"rule of reason,\" which is a more powerful and flexible framework for the petitioners' side.\n\n4.  **The Two Decisive Battlegrounds (Evolved Synthesis):** My previous synthesis identified two key issues. The SG's brief has provided critical new information that alters my assessment of both.\n    *   **The Statutory Interpretation Clash (Refined):** This is no longer a simple binary choice between the petitioners' \"proximate cause\" and the respondents' \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard. The Solicitor General has introduced a crucial middle-ground position. The SG argues for a \"manageable, context-specific\" analysis guided by a \"rule of reason\" derived from *Public Citizen*. This standard requires a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" (*Metropolitan Edison*) and is not satisfied by mere but-for causation or foreseeability alone. Critically, the SG argues that the 2023 FRA did not eliminate this causality requirement, but merely codified the separate foreseeability element. The SG also explicitly warns the petitioners against importing a rigid tort-law proximate cause standard. This provides the Court an \"off-ramp\" to reverse the D.C. Circuit without adopting a bright-line rule that could have unintended consequences, making a reversal more palatable.\n    *   **The Procedural Off-Ramp (Diminished):** The likelihood of a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) has been substantially reduced. The SG's brief directly addresses the disposition, recommending that the Court decide the legal question presented and then \"remand to the court of appeals.\" The SG explicitly advises the Court *not* to rule on the other case-specific aspects of the lower court's decision that were not challenged in the certiorari petition. This provides the Court with a clear, procedurally clean path to issue a merits ruling on the central NEPA question while avoiding the messy, fact-bound issues that often lead to a DIG. This recommendation from the government significantly lowers the probability of a dismissal.\n\n5.  **Revised Assessment and New Critical Uncertainty (New Synthesis):** My confidence in a reversal of the D.C. Circuit's legal standard has now substantially increased. The SG's brief has provided a powerful, well-reasoned, and precedentially-grounded pathway for the Court to rule for the petitioners on the legal question. The SG's middle-ground \"rule of reason\" standard is likely to be highly influential and may attract a majority of the Court. The primary uncertainty is no longer *whether* the Court will reverse, but rather *what standard it will adopt*. The new critical question is: **Will the Court adopt the SG's nuanced, deferential \"rule of reason\" standard, or will it go further and endorse the petitioners' more rigid, tort-like \"proximate cause\" test?** The choice between these two standards will define the breadth of the ruling and its future impact on NEPA litigation. The likelihood of an affirmance or a DIG now appears low.",

The brief will reveal the petitioners' strategic response to the SG's influential position. If they embrace the SG's standard, it signals a convergence that makes that outcome highly probable. If they double down on their stricter test, it sharpens the conflict for the Court. Either result will cause a significant update to my posterior beliefs about the specific legal rule the Court will adopt, making the Task EIG extremely high. For Design EIG, this action provides a classic and valuable lesson in tracking the 'dance' between the parties and the Solicitor General.

Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.

L. No. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 (42 \nU.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and this Court\u2019s precedents estab-\nlish several basic principles regarding the appropriate \ncontours of an environmental impact statement.  First, \nan agency must analyze the \u201creasonably foreseeable en-\nvironmental effects of the proposed agency action.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i).  Second, the term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental \neffect\u2019  * * *  include[s] a requirement of a reasonably \nclose causal relationship\u201d between the agency action \nand the particular environmental harm.  Metropolitan \nEdison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy, 460 U.S. \n766, 774 (1983).  An agency may therefore draw \u201cman-\nageable\u201d lines concerning causation that look to \u201cthe un-\nderlying policies behind NEPA and Congress\u2019 intent, as \n\n2 \n \ninformed by the \u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Department of \nTransp. v. Public Citizen, 541 U.S. 752, 767 (2004) (ci-\ntation omitted).  Third, when an agency makes a deter-\nmination under this framework about the scope of its \nenvironmental impact statement, a reviewing court \n\u201cmust assume\u201d that the agency has \u201cexercised [its] dis-\ncretion appropriately\u201d \u201c[a]bsent a showing of arbitrary \naction.\u201d  Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U.S. 390, 412 (1976).   \nThe non-federal respondents nonetheless contend \nthat an agency must consider every environmental con-\nsequence that is reasonably foreseeable as a factual \nmatter.  That contention is incorrect.  This Court\u2019s prec-\nedents make clear that NEPA permits agencies to limit \ntheir environmental analyses based on whether and to \nwhat extent the proposed federal action is the \u201clegally \nrelevant cause\u201d of the effects.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 769.  An agency may therefore make a reasonable, \ncontext-specific determination that\u2014based on the scope \nof the proposed action and the provisions of the agency\u2019s \ngoverning statutes\u2014a harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nwarrant additional consideration, or any consideration \nat all, in an environmental impact statement. \nAt the same time, petitioners go too far to the extent \nthey ask this Court to impose the same standard of \nproximate cause that applies in tort suits.  The common \nlaw of torts is distinct from the statutory requirements \nin NEPA and serves different purposes.  Agencies can-\nnot woodenly apply tort standards\u2014or the other cate-\ngorical limits petitioners sometimes appear to advocate \n\u2014where doing so would produce a result that contra-\nvenes NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and its rule of rea-\nson.   \n\n3 \n \nThe Surface Transportation Board (Board) properly \napplied those principles in this case.  The Board made a \nreasonable, context-specific determination that it did \nnot need to provide additional analysis of the upstream \nand downstream effects of oil and gas development and \nrefining in its environmental impact statement.  Accord-\ningly, the court of appeals erred in vacating that portion \nof the Board\u2019s decision.  This Court should so hold and \nremand to the court of appeals.  The Court should de-\ncline petitioners\u2019 request to reach beyond the question \npresented to consider aspects of the court of appeals\u2019 \ndecision that were not challenged in the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari.   \nA. NEPA Permits Agencies To Draw Manageable, Context-\nSpecific Lines In Determining The Scope Of Their  \nEnvironmental Impact Statements \nNEPA\u2019s text requires a federal agency to produce a \n\u201cdetailed statement\u201d examining the environmental ef-\nfects of a proposal for a \u201cmajor Federal action[] signifi-\ncantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).  As the government explained in \nits opening brief (at 19-20), that procedural require-\nment is the primary means through which Congress vin-\ndicated its express intent to develop a \u201cnational envi-\nronmental policy,\u201d under which all federal agencies \nwork to \u201cprevent or eliminate damage to the environ-\nment\u201d and improve public health and welfare, while also \nenhancing understanding of the environment.  42 U.S.C. \n4321, 4331 (emphasis omitted).  But NEPA\u2019s core pro-\ncedural requirement has important limits.   \nAs all parties agree, an agency does not need to con-\nsider an asserted environmental consequence of a pro-\nposed federal action unless it is \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 2; Envtl. Resp. Br. 10; Cnty. Resp. \n\n4 \n \nBr. 22-23.  Congress codified that requirement in its \n2023 amendments to NEPA.  42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)(i) \n(specifying that an agency must examine the \u201creasona-\nbly foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed \nagency action\u201d).  And although the environmental impact \nstatement in this case was completed before those 2023 \namendments were enacted, the regulations of the Coun-\ncil on Environmental Quality (CEQ) have long provided \nthat agencies should consider the \u201creasonably foresee-\nable\u201d environmental effects of their proposed actions.  \n43 Fed. Reg. 55,978, 56,004 (Nov. 29, 1978); 40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(b) (2019); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) and (aa) (2021); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2023); 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(i) (2024).1   \nMoreover, this Court has held that the statutory \nterm \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d embodies a further limi-\ntation on the scope of the environmental consequences \nan agency must analyze.  In Metropolitan Edison, the \nCourt explained that NEPA requires more than mere \n \n1 In a divided decision, the D.C. Circuit recently concluded that \nCEQ does not have statutory authority to issue regulations imple-\nmenting NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements that are binding on fed-\neral agencies and enforceable by the courts.  Marin Audubon Soc\u2019y \nv. FAA, No. 23-1067, 2024 WL 4745044 (Nov. 12, 2024).  The govern-\nment is currently assessing that ruling, which was issued without \nthe benefit of party briefing, as the dissent explained in maintaining \nthat the panel should not have decided the issue.  CEQ began issuing \nNEPA regulations through notice and comment in 1978, see 43 Fed. \nReg. at 55,978, and in the over four decades since, this Court has \nfrequently cited and relied on CEQ\u2019s regulations, e.g., Public Citizen, \n541 U.S. at 770; Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, \n372 (1989); Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U.S. 347, 356 (1979).  What-\never the merits of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s recent decision, CEQ\u2019s regula-\ntions represent the considered judgment of the expert body estab-\nlished by NEPA concerning the appropriate implementation of \nNEPA\u2019s general requirements.  And they also reflect the basic con-\ntours of agency practice under NEPA going back more than 45 years.   \n\n5 \n \n\u201cbut for\u201d causation because the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d must \u201cbe read to include a requirement of a rea-\nsonably close causal relationship between a change in \nthe physical environment and the effect at issue.\u201d  460 \nU.S. at 774.  Then, in Public Citizen, the Court ex-\nplained that an agency action is not the \u201clegally relevant \ncause\u201d of an environmental harm the agency lacks the \npower to prevent.  541 U.S. at 769.  And more generally, \nPublic Citizen held that agencies are permitted to draw \n\u201cmanageable\u201d lines to identify the consequences that \nhave a sufficiently close causal connection to the pro-\nposed action to warrant consideration, informed by the \n\u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason\u2019\u200a\u201d inherent in NEPA and the \u201cstatutory \npurposes\u201d of an environmental impact statement.  Id. at \n767-768 (citation omitted).  Those purposes are primar-\nily (1) \u201c\u200a\u2018ensur[ing] that the agency, in reaching its deci-\nsion, will have available, and will carefully consider, de-\ntailed information concerning significant environmental \nimpacts,\u2019\u200a\u201d and (2) providing relevant information to the \npublic that serves as a \u201c\u200a\u2018springboard for public com-\nment\u2019 in the agency decisionmaking process itself.\u201d  Id. \nat 768 (citation omitted).   \nUnder these principles, an agency may exclude or \nminimize consideration of environmental harms based \non its determination that, in light of the scope of the \nproposed federal action and the nature of the agency\u2019s \norganic statutes, the harms are too attenuated, specu-\nlative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process.  \nPublic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-22, \n27-28.  Courts may not set aside such a determination \nunless it is arbitrary or capricious.  Kleppe, 427 U.S. at \n412.   \n\n6 \n \nB. The Non-Federal Respondents Err In Asserting That \nReasonable Foreseeability Is The Only Limit On The \nScope Of An Environmental Impact Statement \nThe non-federal respondents agree (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 44) with the basic principle that an agency \nneed not consider \u201ceffects that are too attenuated, spec-\nulative, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material \nto the environmental review that NEPA requires.\u201d  But \nthey err in suggesting that those considerations are \nfully accounted for by the reasonable foreseeability re-\nquirement.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that \nreasonable foreseeability is not the only limit on an \nagency\u2019s NEPA obligations because those obligations \nare triggered only by a \u201creasonably close causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the proposed agency action and the \nasserted effect, Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774, \nand the extent of the analysis required of the agency is \nsubject to the \u201crule of reason\u201d inherent in NEPA, Pub-\nlic Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767-768.   \n1. \u201cReasonable foreseeability\u201d is one key limit on the \nscope of a NEPA analysis.  Current CEQ regulations, \nwhich were in place in 2023 when Congress codified the \n\u201creasonable foreseeability\u201d requirement in NEPA, define \n\u201c[r]easonably foreseeable\u201d as \u201csufficiently likely to oc-\ncur such that a person of ordinary prudence would take \nit into account in reaching a decision.\u201d  85 Fed. Reg. \n43,304, 43,376 (July 16, 2020) (40 C.F.R. 1508.1(aa) \n(2021)) (emphasis omitted); see 40 C.F.R. 1508.1(ii) \n(2024) (same).  That definition, which accords with the \nplain meaning of the phrase, places the emphasis on \nwhat effects an agency should reasonably anticipate.  It \ntherefore permits agencies to exclude effects that are \ntoo contingent, removed, or uncertain to warrant con-\nsideration.   \n\n7 \n \nBut this Court\u2019s precedents make clear that agencies \nmay impose limits on their NEPA analyses beyond \nthose captured by the term \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d  \nMetropolitan Edison explained that the statutory term \n\u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect\u2019\u200a\u201d further requires a \u201creasonably \nclose causal relationship.\u201d  460 U.S. at 774.  And in Pub-\nlic Citizen, the Court recognized that, even when an en-\nvironmental harm is \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d 541 U.S. \nat 766 (citation omitted), NEPA\u2019s causation standard \nmay not be met, id. at 767-768.  That is because the cau-\nsation standard looks not only to factual foreseeability, \nbut also to the scope of the agency\u2019s action and the use-\nfulness of particular environmental analysis, informed \nby the agency\u2019s statutory authority, and NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of reason.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 768.   \nWhile there is undoubtedly overlap between the re-\nquirements of reasonable foreseeability and the causa-\ntion standards under NEPA, see Gov\u2019t Br. 23-24, the \nnon-federal respondents wrongly assume that the over-\nlap is complete.  They therefore assert (e.g., Envtl. \nResp. Br. 1) that NEPA requires an agency to consider \nevery environmental harm for which the agency\u2019s action \nis the but-for cause, so long as the harm is \u201csufficiently \nlikely to occur and capable of being considered in suffi-\ncient detail.\u201d  That test would impose a rigidly expan-\nsive obligation on federal agencies, depriving them of \nthe ability to make a reasonable determination regard-\ning whether and to what extent the analysis of a harm \nwill be useful to the decisionmaking process.  And the \nnon-federal respondents\u2019 test would also be inconsistent \nwith Metropolitan Edison and Public Citizen, which \nemphasized that agencies are permitted to draw a \u201cman-\nageable\u201d line between environmental consequences that \nhave a reasonably close causal relationship with the pro-\n\n8 \n \nposed federal action and those that do not, based on \nNEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule of reason.   \n2. The non-federal respondents mistakenly suggest \nthat Congress\u2019s 2023 NEPA amendments confirm that \nreasonable foreseeability is the only permissible limit \non an agency\u2019s NEPA analysis.  Metropolitan Edison \nand Public Citizen explained that the requirement of a \n\u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d is contained in \nthe statutory term \u201c\u200a\u2018environmental effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Metropol-\nitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774.  That term remains in the \nstatute after the 2023 amendments, and none of Con-\ngress\u2019s other changes suggest an intent to depart from \nthe Court\u2019s prior construction.   \nIndeed, it would be more than passing strange to \nread the 2023 NEPA amendments to broaden the range \nof harms an agency must consider beyond what this \nCourt\u2019s prior precedents established, because several of \nthose amendments were aimed at lessening the burden \non federal agencies.  Thus, the amendments contain pro-\nvisions for shortening both the length of environmental \nimpact statements, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), and the time de-\nvoted to the environmental review process, 42 U.S.C. \n4336a(g).  It is hard to imagine, for example, how an \nagency could fit a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm that might flow from a \nmajor federal action into the 150 pages the amendments \ncontemplate, 42 U.S.C. 4336a(e), when the environmen-\ntal impact statement respondents found lacking here \nwas almost 600 pages and had approximately 3000 \npages of appendices.   \n3. The non-federal respondents also err in asserting \n(e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that allowing agencies to draw \nmanageable lines leads to \u201cunbounded and unpredicta-\nble results.\u201d  An agency generally cannot disregard a \n\n9 \n \nreasonably foreseeable environmental effect where \nthere is a \u201creasonably close causal relationship\u201d be-\ntween the effect and the proposed agency action.  That \nstandard is flexible, not boundless.  It permits an agency \nto exclude or minimize the analysis of effects where the \nagency reasonably finds that the requisite causal rela-\ntionship is absent or diminished.  And an agency may \nmake that finding based on a range of context-specific \nfactors, including the scope of the proposed action, the \nnature and reach of the agency\u2019s organic statutes, and \nwhether the asserted harm is too attenuated, specula-\ntive, contingent, or otherwise insufficiently material to \nthe particular agency decision.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. \nat 767.  The fact that other governmental entities au-\nthorize, fund, or carry out the specific conduct that \ngives rise to the environmental issues may also inform \nan agency\u2019s determination that the requisite \u201creasona-\nbly close causal relationship\u201d between its own actions \nand particular harms is missing or less robust.  Ibid. (ci-\ntation omitted); see Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18.  But an agency may \nnot exclude analysis of a reasonably foreseeable effect \nif those same considerations establish the agency action \nis the \u201clegally relevant cause\u201d of the effect and consid-\nering the effect is necessary to accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cun-\nderlying policies\u201d and is consistent with its \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of rea-\nson.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 768-769.   \n4. The non-federal respondents are also wrong to \ncontend (e.g., Envtl. Resp. Br. 46) that the government\u2019s \nposition represents a \u201cchange[]\u201d from \u201cthe longstand-\ning, well-understood framework for environmental re-\nview under NEPA.\u201d  As Metropolitan Edison and Pub-\nlic Citizen make clear, NEPA has always included room \nfor agencies to draw \u201c\u200a\u2018manageable,\u2019\u200a\u201d context-specific \nlines based on the extent to which the analysis of envi-\n\n10 \n \nronmental harms will be \u201cuseful[]\u201d to the decisionmak-\ning process.  Public Citizen, 541 U.S. at 767 (citation \nomitted).   \nFurther, for over four decades, CEQ has emphasized \nthat agencies should \u201cfocus[] on the major issues and \nreal choices facing federal decisionmakers and ex-\nclud[e] less important matters from detailed study.\u201d  43 \nFed. Reg. at 55,983.  In promulgating the 1978 NEPA \nregulations, CEQ explained that such line drawing is \ncrucial because \u201c[t]he usefulness of the NEPA process \nto decisionmakers and the public ha[d] been jeopard-\nized in recent years by the length and complexity of en-\nvironmental impact statements.\u201d  Ibid.  And in promul-\ngating regulatory amendments in 1986, CEQ reiterated \nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation of \u201creasonably foreseeable \nsignificant adverse effects\u201d should be informed by the \n\u201crule of reason.\u201d  51 Fed. Reg. 15,618, 15,621, 15,625-\n15,626 (Apr. 25, 1986).  CEQ explained that the \u201c\u200a\u2018rule of \nreason\u2019 is basically a judicial device to ensure that com-\nmon sense and reason are not lost,\u201d and that agencies \nare not forced to \u201c\u200a\u2018discuss remote and highly specula-\ntive consequences\u2019\u200a\u201d that will not be useful to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  Ibid. (citation omitted).   \nCurrent CEQ regulations carry forward the long-\nstanding position that agencies should draw managea-\nble lines that focus an agency\u2019s resources and attention \non the issues that are most significant to the deci-\nsionmaking process.  The regulations call for agencies \nto undertake a \u201cscoping\u201d process at the outset of an en-\nvironmental review during which they \u201cidentify[] the \nimportant issues and eliminat[e] from further study un-\nimportant issues,\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(a), as well as issues \nthat \u201chave been covered by prior environmental re-\nview(s),\u201d 40 C.F.R. 1502.4(d)(1).  The regulations also \n\n11 \n \nprovide that \u201c[e]nvironmental impact statements shall \ndiscuss effects in proportion to their significance,\u201d with \n\u201conly brief discussion of other than important issues.\u201d  \n40 C.F.R. 1502.2(b); see 40 C.F.R. 1500.2, 1500.4, \n1501.1(d).   \nIn addition, this Court\u2019s precedents have long em-\nphasized that judicial review of an agency\u2019s final deci-\nsion under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n701 et seq.\u2014including review of an agency\u2019s decisions \nregarding the scope and content of its accompanying \nenvironmental impact statement\u2014is highly deferential \nand may be set aside only if arbitrary and capricious.  In \nMarsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. \n360 (1989), for example, this Court recognized that \u201can \nagency must have discretion to rely on the reasonable \nopinions of its own qualified experts even if, as an orig-\ninal matter, a court might find contrary views more per-\nsuasive.\u201d  Id. at 378.   \nC. Petitioners Err To The Extent They Endorse Bright-\nLine Rules That Find No Footing In NEPA\u2019s Text \nPetitioners and the federal respondents are in ac-\ncord on the basic principles governing the requirements \nof NEPA, all of which support the sufficiency of the \nBoard\u2019s NEPA analysis that is before the Court in this \ncase.  See pp. 19-22, infra.  Like the federal respond-\nents, petitioners argue (Br. 21) that the review required \nby NEPA encompasses only the \u201creasonably foreseea-\nble effects of\u200a\u201d a proposed action.  They further argue \n(Br. 17) that, in determining what qualifies as an \u201cef-\nfect[]\u201d of a project, NEPA does not apply a but-for \nstandard of causation, and instead looks to whether the \nproposed agency action is the \u201clegally relevant\u201d cause \nof the environmental harm.  Petitioners also emphasize \nthat agencies must be permitted to draw \u201cmanageable\u201d \n\n12 \n \nlines that accomplish NEPA\u2019s \u201cgoal of \u2018ensur[ing] a \nfully informed and well considered [agency] decision\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwithout requiring analysis of matters that are insuffi-\nciently material.  Br. 42 (citation omitted; first set of \nbrackets in original).  And, like federal respondents, pe-\ntitioners observe that, in drawing those lines, agencies \nmay look to the limits of their statutory \u201cremit,\u201d Br. 26, \nand the \u201cattenuated,\u201d Br. 33 (citation omitted), \u201cspecu-\nlative,\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d nature of the alleged environ-\nmental harms, Br. 36.  \nAt times, however, petitioners appear to go further, \nsuggesting that an agency may apply bright-line rules \nto exclude analysis of reasonably foreseeable environ-\nmental effects for which the agency is the legally rele-\nvant cause, even though that analysis would be useful to \nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking and would aid the public in \nproviding informed comments during the decisionmak-\ning process.  Neither NEPA\u2019s text nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents support imposition of those limits. \n1. Petitioners suggest (e.g., Br. 30-31) that agencies \nshould apply the same proximate cause standard that \napplies in tort suits.  But this Court has already rejected \nthe contention that \u201cany cause-effect relation too atten-\nuated to merit damages in a tort suit would also be too \nattenuated to merit notice in an\u201d environmental impact \nstatement.  Metropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 774 n.7.  \nAs the government explained in its opening brief (at 34-\n37), tort law and NEPA serve different purposes.  Tort \nsuits assign monetary liability for a harm that has al-\nready occurred; NEPA is designed to implement a na-\ntional environmental policy by ensuring that agency de-\ncisionmaking is informed by the consideration of signif-\nicant environmental effects that are likely to occur in \nthe future.  Even when a connection between an agency \n\n13 \n \naction and an effect is not of a kind that might justify \nmonetary liability in a tort suit, the causal connection \nmay be close enough\u2014given the scope of the proposed \naction and the nature and reach of the agency\u2019s govern-\ning statutes\u2014that information about the harm will \nnonetheless make a material contribution to the agency\u2019s \ndecisionmaking process.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7.  Conversely, there may be circum-\nstances in which tort law would impose liability but \nthere is not a sufficiently \u201cclose causal relationship\u201d for \npurposes of NEPA.  Ibid. \nFurther, as the environmental respondents explain \n(Br. 38-40), tort law has evolved, and some of the prin-\nciples that petitioners purport to draw from tort law are \noutdated or at least disputed.  Requiring agencies to di-\nvert their attention to parsing tort principles for which \nthey have no particular expertise would therefore be \nlikely to lead to more confusion and uncertainty for the \nagencies in preparing their environmental impact state-\nments, for project proponents seeking NEPA review, \nand for the courts charged with adjudicating any subse-\nquent challenges.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 36-37.  These additional \nburdens would run counter to Congress\u2019s goal in the \n2023 amendments of making the NEPA process more \nefficient. \nThis Court\u2019s decision in Robertson v. Methow Valley \nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332 (1989), illustrates the \ndelta between tort law and NEPA.  In Robertson, the \nForest Service prepared an environmental impact \nstatement in connection with its issuance of a special \nuse permit for a ski resort that would be built on federal \nland.  Id. at 336.  The effects the Forest Service ana-\nlyzed included both the immediate effects on air quality \nand animal populations that would arise from construct-\n\n14 \n \ning and operating the resort, and the \u201cadverse effects \non air quality and the mule deer herd\u201d in the surround-\ning area that were \u201cprimarily attributable to predicted \noff-site development\u201d spurred by the new resort.  Id. at \n350.  It is highly unlikely that the Forest Service (which, \nin any event, enjoys sovereign immunity) or even the \nnew ski resort could have been held liable in a tort suit \nbrought by a local resident harmed by the changes in \nair quality and mule deer population attributable to the \nnew development.  But the Court nonetheless cited the \nForest Service\u2019s consideration of those secondary ef-\nfects with approval, adding that their consideration en-\nsured that local authorities were given \u201cadequate notice \nof the expected consequences\u201d of the proposed federal \naction and a chance to plan their response.  Ibid.   \nPetitioners observe (Br. 24) that Robertson affirmed \nthe Forest Service\u2019s decision to issue its environmental \nimpact statement before the local authorities fully \u201cde-\nveloped\u201d a mitigation plan that identified specific mea-\nsures to address the changes in air quality and the mule \ndeer population that would result from the new devel-\nopment.  But the Court did not hold that the Forest Ser-\nvice was free to ignore the air quality and mule deer ef-\nfects altogether, as a strict analogy to tort law might \nsuggest.  Instead, the Court recognized that the need to \ndiscuss \u201cmitigation\u201d \u201cin sufficient detail to ensure that \nenvironmental consequences have been fairly evalu-\nated\u201d did not extend so far as to require the agency to \ndelay the release of its environmental impact statement \nuntil it received a final mitigation plan from local au-\nthorities to address off-site effects that were outside of \nthe agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  Robertson, 490 U.S. at 352.  \nRobertson therefore demonstrates that agencies may \ndraw manageable lines based on credible, available in-\n\n15 \n \nformation, the scope of the project, and the agency\u2019s or-\nganic statutes, not the wooden application of tort law. \n2. Petitioners similarly err in suggesting that the \n2023 NEPA amendments codified tort law standards of \nproximate cause by adding the term \u201creasonably fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Br. 27-28 (citation and emphasis omitted).  \nWhile \u201cforeseeability\u201d is typically an important compo-\nnent in a proximate cause analysis, it is not the sole com-\nponent.  This Court has explained that the proximate \ncause standard drawn from \u201c\u200a\u2018tort actions recognized at \ncommon law\u2019\u200a\u201d generally requires the application of \u201cdi-\nrectness principles\u201d of causation that typically limit \ndamages liability to harms within the \u201c\u200a\u2018first step.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 203 \n(2017) (citations omitted).  The 2023 NEPA amend-\nments codify the reasonable foreseeability standard, \nbut nothing in the amendments suggests that Congress \nalso intended to incorporate tort law\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018first step\u2019\u200a\u201d or \n\u201cdirectness principles.\u201d  Ibid. (citations omitted).  Nor \ndoes anything in the amendments suggest that Con-\ngress intended to depart from this Court\u2019s longstanding \nprecedents interpreting the term \u201cenvironmental ef-\nfect\u201d to incorporate the need for a reasonably close \ncausal connection, but not to adopt the same causation \nstandards as tort law.  See Metropolitan Edison, 460 \nU.S. at 774 & n.7. \nMoreover, imposing a strict \u201cdirectness\u201d or \u201cfirst \nstep\u201d limit on NEPA\u2019s requirements would mark a sub-\nstantial shift in the way the statute has traditionally \nbeen interpreted and applied.  As Robertson illustrates, \nagencies have long considered both the direct effects of \ntheir actions (in Robertson, the harms to air quality and \nlocal animals caused by the construction of the ski re-\nsort itself\u200a), and secondary effects (i.e., the harm to the \n\n16 \n \nair quality and mule deer population caused by the new \noff-site development the ski resort would trigger) that \nare both caused by the action and reasonably foreseea-\nble.  Indeed, the first NEPA regulations provided that \nagencies should consider not just the \u201cdirect\u201d environ-\nmental effects of the proposed agency action, but also \nreasonably foreseeable \u201cindirect\u201d effects.  40 C.F.R. \n1508.8(a) and (b) (1979).  And the regulations in place at \nthe time of Congress\u2019s 2023 amendments to NEPA (and \nstill in place now) similarly call for agencies to consider \nreasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of their actions.  40 C.F.R. 1508.1(g) (2022); 40 \nC.F.R. 1508.1(i). \n \n3. For similar reasons, petitioners err to the extent \nthey assert (Br. 40) that, under Metropolitan Edison, \nan agency may exclude the consideration of an environ-\nmental effect whenever it is mediated through \u201cnon- \nenvironmental effects\u201d on third parties.  See Pet. Br. 19-\n22.  Petitioners appear to suggest (ibid.), for example, \nthat an agency may disregard the environmental effects \nof new development spurred by a federal project be-\ncause that development is itself \u201cnon-environmental.\u201d  \nAgain, in Robertson, the Court recognized the propriety \nof the agency\u2019s consideration of environmental effects \ncaused by \u201cpredicted off-site development,\u201d rather than \nby the construction and operation of the ski resort itself.  \n490 U.S. at 350.  And agencies often consider environ-\nmental effects mediated through third parties when \nthey determine it is appropriate to do so based on the \ncontext, including the scope of the project and the na-\nture of the agency\u2019s organic statutes.  For example, be-\nfore the Federal Highway Administration funds a high-\nway project, it often considers the land use effects of the \n\n17 \n \nnew infrastructure, including reasonably foreseeable \ngrowth in nearby communities.2  \n \nPetitioners\u2019 proposed rule also rests on a misreading \nof Metropolitan Edison.  In that case, the Court held \nthat, in authorizing the reopening of a nuclear facility, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not need to \nconsider the harms to the psychological health of nearby \nresidents that were caused by their fears concerning \nthe risk of a nuclear accident, because NEPA requires \nagencies to consider the public health consequences of \nchanges in the natural and physical environment, not \nthe health consequences of \u201crisk qua risk.\u201d  Metropoli-\ntan Edison, 460 U.S. at 779.  Metropolitan Edison\u2019s \nholding was therefore based on the Court\u2019s determina-\ntion that NEPA is focused on \u201cchange[s] in the physical \nenvironment\u201d and that the health harms flowing from \nfears or \u201crisk\u201d itself were \u201ctoo remote from the physical \nenvironment to justify\u201d requiring the agency to con-\nsider them.  Id. at 774.   \n \nThat holding cannot be extended to permit an agency \nto ignore reasonably foreseeable effects on the human \nenvironment solely on the ground that the federal pro-\nject would spur development or some other third-party \naction that in turn results in those effects.  As explained, \nsee pp. 4-5, supra, agencies are free to consider the at-\ntenuated or contingent nature of a harm or its material-\nity to the agency\u2019s decision in drawing a manageable \nline based on NEPA\u2019s underlying policies and the rule \nof reason.  But agencies must draw that line in context, \nand there is no categorical rule that could be applied to \n \n2 See, e.g., Fed. Highway Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., Instruc-\ntions for Reviewing Travel and Land Use Forecasting Analysis in \nNEPA Documents (Feb. 21, 2018), https://www.environment.fhwa. \ndot.gov/nepa/Travel_LandUse/forecasting_reviewer_guidance.aspx.  \n\n18 \n \nevery agency and project in determining whether a suf-\nficiently close causal connection exists. \n \n4. Petitioners likewise err to the extent they suggest \n(Br. 44) that agencies may ignore effects that fall out-\nside their \u201csubject-matter expertise.\u201d  NEPA expressly \ncontemplates that agencies will sometimes have to con-\nsider effects for which a different \u201cFederal agency\u201d \n\u201chas jurisdiction by law or special expertise.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n4332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see 42 U.S.C. 4336a(a)(3) \n(permitting a lead agency to \u201cdesignate any Federal, \nState, Tribal, or local agency that has jurisdiction by \nlaw or special expertise with respect to any environmen-\ntal impact involved in a proposal to serve as a cooperat-\ning agency\u201d).  The statutorily mandated solution is co-\noperation and consultation with other agencies, not dis-\nregarding the effects altogether.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 31-33. \n \nMetropolitan Edison does not suggest otherwise.  \nPetitioners observe (Br. 44) that Metropolitan Edison \nstated that requiring agencies to consider the \u201cpsycho-\nlogical health damage caused by risk\u201d would mean that \nagencies would have \u201cto expend considerable resources \ndeveloping psychiatric expertise that is not otherwise \nrelevant to their congressionally assigned functions.\u201d  \n460 U.S. at 776.  But the Court explained that this was \na problem because spending resources to gain psychiat-\nric knowledge might divert agencies\u2019 attention and \nleave them \u201cunable adequately to pursue\u201d NEPA\u2019s core \npurposes\u2014the \u201cprotection of the physical environment \nand natural resources.\u201d  Ibid.  The concern was there-\nfore about a diversion of resources from NEPA\u2019s cen-\ntral environmental focus; the Court was not endorsing \na general rule excusing agencies from including any \nanalysis of environmental effects outside their area of \nexpertise.   \n\n19 \n \n \n5. Of course, none of this is to say that an agency \nmust engage in a detailed analysis of every reasonably \nforeseeable environmental harm.  The government \nagrees with petitioners that, as this Court has observed, \nagencies must be permitted to draw a \u201cmanageable\u201d \nline \u201cif NEPA\u2019s goal of \u2018insur[ing] a fully informed and \nwell-considered decision\u2019 is to be accomplished.\u201d  Met-\nropolitan Edison, 460 U.S. at 776 (citation omitted; \nbrackets in original).  But an agency must draw its line \nwith that goal in mind, focusing on the question of \nwhether\u2014in light of the nature of the project and the \ngoverning statutes\u2014the analysis of particular harms is \ncalled for by NEPA\u2019s standard of a reasonably close \ncausal relationship and its rule of reason.  Agencies can-\nnot simply rely on the rigid application of tort principles \nor bright-line and categorical rules regarding interven-\ning effects or agency expertise.   \nD. The Surface Transportation Board Reasonably Declined \nTo Perform Additional Analysis Of The Upstream And \nDownstream Effects Of Oil And Gas Development \nThe problems with an expansive gloss on NEPA are \nthrown into sharp relief by the environmental respond-\nents\u2019 attempt (Br. 28-29) to defend the D.C. Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in this case regarding the Surface Transportation \nBoard\u2019s analysis of the upstream effects of oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Uinta Basin and the downstream ef-\nfects of refining in the Gulf Coast.   \n1. In preparing its environmental impact statement \nin connection with its authorization of a proposed rail \nline connecting the Uinta Basin to existing railways, the \nBoard engaged in detailed consideration of a wide range \nof potential environmental effects.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 6-8.  \nAmong those effects were the potential environmental \nconsequences of increases in oil and gas development in \n\n20 \n \nthe Uinta Basin that the new line might spur, and the \npotential increases in oil and gas refining.  See, e.g., J.A. \n351-362, 365-474.  The Board, for example, estimated \nthe aggregate additional emissions of greenhouse gases \nthat could occur from oil refining spurred by the new \nrail line.  J.A. 423. \nWhen the environmental respondents filed public \ncomments asserting that the almost 50 pages of analysis \nthat the draft environmental impact statement provided \nwith respect to the upstream and downstream effects of \noil and gas development were not sufficient, the Board \noffered a detailed response.  J.A. 520-529.  That response \nenumerated the various considerations that prompted \nthe Board to conclude that additional analysis of the up-\nstream and downstream effects of oil and gas develop-\nment would not \u201cinform\u201d its decisionmaking.  J.A. 521.  \nThe Board explained that the limited scope of its gov-\nerning statutes, the specific nature of the proposed ac-\ntion, and the attenuated, contingent, and speculative na-\nture of the effects all counseled against further analysis \nof the effects of oil and gas production in the Uinta Ba-\nsin and the localized effects of refining of the oil in dis-\ntant locations.  See J.A. 520-529; see also J.A. 421, 477-\n482; Pet. App. 107a-109a.  \nIn its final decision authorizing the new rail line, the \nBoard reiterated its explanation for declining to engage \nin additional analysis of these effects.  It observed that \nit \u201chas no authority or jurisdiction over development of \noil and gas in the Basin nor any authority to control or \nmitigate the impacts of any such development.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 108a.  And it stated that \u201c[o]il and gas development \nthat may occur following authorization of the [new rail-\nroad line] would entail many separate and independent \nprojects that have not yet been proposed or planned and \n\n21 \n \nthat could occur on private, state, tribal, or federal land \nand could range in scale from a single vertical oil well to \na large lease.\u201d  Ibid.  With respect to the effects of oil \nrefining, the Board determined that \u201cthe actual volumes \nof crude oil that would move over the [new line] would \ndepend on various independent variables and influences, \nincluding general domestic and global economic condi-\ntions, commodity pricing, the strategic and capital in-\nvestment decisions of oil producers, and future market \ndemand for crude oil from the Basin.\u201d  Id. at 106a.  The \nBoard further observed that it has \u201cno jurisdiction or \ncontrol over the destinations or end uses of any prod-\nucts or commodities transported on the proposed rail \nline.\u201d  J.A. 422.   \nBecause the Board\u2019s explanation was reasonable and \nconsistent with NEPA\u2019s text and underlying policies \nand the rule of reason, there was no basis for the court \nof appeals to find it arbitrary and capricious.  Yet the \nenvironmental respondents insist (Br. 28-29) that the \nagency was obligated to perform the additional analysis \nthey requested because the \u201ceffects were likely to oc-\ncur,\u201d \u201c[t]he Board had enough information to consider \nthose effects,\u201d and it had \u201cundisputed authority\u201d to do \nso.  That conception of an agency\u2019s NEPA obligations \nthreatens to mire agencies in boundless NEPA review, \nforcing them to perform additional NEPA analysis any \ntime a challenger points to some additional information \nthe agency could have included in its environmental im-\npact statement\u2014no matter how tenuous the connection \nto the federal action or how unlikely it is that the addi-\ntional information would be material to the agency and \nthe public in the decisionmaking process.  The Court \nshould reject that understanding of NEPA and vacate \nthis aspect of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision.   \n\n22 \n \n2. There are no substantial grounds for the Court to \nproceed further and consider aspects of the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision that petitioners did not challenge in their \ncertiorari petition.  That petition focused exclusively on \nwhether the court of appeals had misapplied Public Cit-\nizen by finding that the Board was required to consider \nthe upstream and downstream effects of oil and gas de-\nvelopment.  See Pet. i.  In their merits brief before this \nCourt, however, petitioners assert (e.g., Br. 30-31) that \nthe court of appeals also erred in finding that the Board \nwas required to consider certain downline effects, such \nas potential rail accidents, forest fires, and effects on \nlocal bodies of water.  But whether or not the Board was \nrequired by NEPA to consider the downline risks of \nfires or rail accidents (including the possible effects of \nan oil spill resulting from an accident), it did so, in ac-\ncordance with the Board\u2019s environmental regulations \nand practice.  See, e.g., 49 C.F.R. 1105.7(e); J.A. 199, \n201, 220, 222.  \nIn any event, the argument that the Board was not \nrequired to consider those downline effects was not \nraised before the court of appeals.  The parties instead \ndisputed whether the Board had committed certain er-\nrors during its analysis of those downline effects.  See \nPet. App. 40a-45a.  The court therefore did not pass on \nthe question of whether the Board was required to con-\nsider the effects in the first place.  Because this Court \nis one \u201cof review, not of first view,\u201d and because the is-\nsue is not properly before the Court in any event, the \nCourt should decline to consider the issue.  Cutter v. \nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005).3  \n \n3 At times, petitioners also appear to challenge (Br. 43-47) the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s determination that there were fact-specific errors in \n \n\n23 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed in relevant part, and the case should be  \nremanded to the court of appeals for further proceed-\nings consistent with the Court\u2019s opinion. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, which details the internal reasoning and analysis of the Solicitor General's (SG) reply brief, does not introduce new external evidence. Instead, it serves as a confirmation and explicit articulation of the analytical process that led to my most recent, significant belief update. This reinforces the validity of that update and solidifies my current understanding of the case's trajectory. My beliefs, as previously synthesized, are now more firmly grounded.\n\nMy cumulative and reinforced beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondents' Core Framework\u2014Defending the Status Quo (Stable, Persuasive Power Confirmed as Weakened):** Eagle County's argument that the D.C. Circuit correctly applied a \"reasonably foreseeable\" standard, which they claim was codified by the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), remains the foundation of their case. The analysis of the SG's brief confirms that this position is now on weak footing. The SG's argument\u2014that the FRA did not abrogate this Court's precedents (*Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen*, *Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy*) requiring a \"reasonably close causal relationship\"\u2014is a direct and powerful counter that significantly undermines the respondents' statutory interpretation.\n\n2.  **Direct Rebuttal of Key Precedents (Stable and Central):** The case continues to hinge on the interpretation of *Public Citizen* and *Metropolitan Edison*. The SG's engagement with these precedents, contrasting with the respondents' interpretation, reinforces my belief that the Court's decision will be a clarification of its own NEPA causation jurisprudence.\n\n3.  **Reframing the Scope of NEPA Analysis (Stable):** The SG's framing of the issue in terms of agency discretion under a \"rule of reason\" remains a more compelling and flexible framework than the respondents' arguments about inter-agency roles. This \"rule of reason\" approach, derived from *Public Citizen*, is likely to be attractive to the Court as it respects agency expertise while providing a limiting principle on NEPA's scope.\n\n4.  **The Two Decisive Battlegrounds (Synthesis Confirmed and Solidified):** The analysis of the SG's brief confirms my identification of the two key issues and the SG's influence on them.\n    *   **The Statutory Interpretation Clash (Refined and Confirmed):** The central conflict is now definitively framed not as a binary choice, but as a three-way decision between (a) the respondents' broad \"reasonably foreseeable\" test, (b) the petitioners' rigid \"proximate cause\" test, and (c) the SG's nuanced \"rule of reason\" standard. The SG's position, which requires a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" in addition to foreseeability and explicitly warns against importing a strict tort-law standard, provides the Court with a well-reasoned, precedentially-grounded \"off-ramp.\" This path allows the Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit without adopting an overly restrictive rule, making reversal a more probable outcome.\n    *   **The Procedural Off-Ramp (Confirmed as Diminished):** The likelihood of a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) remains substantially low. The observation confirms that the SG's explicit recommendation to decide the legal question and \"remand to the court of appeals\" provides a clean procedural path for a merits ruling. This advice from the government makes it highly probable the Court will address the central legal question.\n\n5.  **Revised Assessment and New Critical Uncertainty (Confirmed as the Central Predictive Question):** My confidence in a reversal of the D.C. Circuit's legal standard remains high. The SG's brief has provided a powerful, moderate pathway for the Court to side with the petitioners on the question presented. The primary uncertainty has definitively shifted from *whether* the Court will reverse to *how* it will reverse. The critical question that will determine the outcome and impact of this case is now firmly established: **Will the Court adopt the SG's deferential, context-specific \"rule of reason\" standard, or will it go further and endorse the petitioners' more rigid, tort-like \"proximate cause\" test?** The probability of an affirmance or a DIG is now assessed as very low. My predictive focus is now entirely on the choice between the two standards for reversal.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is the Reply Brief for the Federal Respondents (the Solicitor General, or SG), which provides the government's final written arguments before oral argument. This brief significantly clarifies the government's position relative to both the respondents (Eagle County) and the petitioners (Seven County), allowing me to resolve a key uncertainty from my previous analysis. My beliefs have been substantially refined, not just reinforced.\n\nMy cumulative and updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n1.  **Respondents' Core Framework (Confirmed as Critically Weakened):** My prior assessment that Eagle County's argument is on weak footing is now confirmed with high confidence. The SG's reply brief directly and forcefully attacks the respondents' central claim that \"reasonable foreseeability is the only limit on the scope of an environmental impact statement.\" The SG argues this position is inconsistent with this Court's precedents in *Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen* and *Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy*, which require a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" as a separate, additional limit. Furthermore, the SG's argument that the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) amendments were intended to *streamline*, not expand, NEPA review (e.g., by imposing page limits) serves as a powerful rebuttal to the respondents' statutory interpretation. The likelihood of the Court adopting the respondents' expansive view of NEPA is now exceptionally low.\n\n2.  **The SG's Explicit Rejection of Petitioners' Standard (New, Critical Insight):** My previous primary uncertainty was whether the Court, upon reversing, would adopt the SG's \"rule of reason\" or the petitioners' more rigid \"proximate cause\" test. The SG's reply brief provides dispositive evidence on this point by explicitly distancing the government from the petitioners' legal standard. The brief states, \"petitioners go too far to the extent they ask this Court to impose the same standard of proximate cause that applies in tort suits\" and \"Petitioners err to the extent they endorse bright-line rules that find no footing in NEPA\u2019s text.\" The SG cites *Metropolitan Edison* to argue that the Court has already rejected a simple importation of tort law into the NEPA context. This is a crucial signal: the government is not just offering a different path to reversal; it is actively arguing *against* the petitioners' proposed rule.\n\n3.  **Solidification of the \"Middle Way\" as the Most Probable Outcome (Belief Refined and Strengthened):** The SG has successfully and deliberately carved out a moderate, precedentially-grounded position between the two parties.\n    *   **Against Respondents:** NEPA requires more than just foreseeability; it requires a \"reasonably close causal relationship.\"\n    *   **Against Petitioners:** The \"reasonably close causal relationship\" test is not equivalent to tort-law proximate cause; it is a more flexible, context-specific \"rule of reason\" that grants agencies discretion.\n    This \"middle way\" allows the Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2014the outcome sought by the petitioners and the government\u2014without creating a rigid, bright-line rule that could unduly constrain agency action in future, unrelated cases. This type of solution, which respects both precedent and agency expertise, is often highly attractive to the Court, particularly to its median justices.\n\n4.  **The Decisive Battleground\u2014The Choice of Standard (Resolved):** The central predictive question has shifted. It is no longer a three-way contest between the standards proposed by the respondents, petitioners, and the SG. The contest is effectively over. The SG's brief has made the respondents' position appear contrary to precedent and the petitioners' position appear too extreme and rigid. The most probable outcome is now clearly a reversal of the D.C. Circuit based on a standard that mirrors the one articulated by the Solicitor General.\n\n5.  **Revised Assessment and New Predictive Focus:** My confidence in a reversal of the D.C. Circuit's legal standard is now extremely high. The probability of an affirmance or a Dismissal as Improvidently Granted (DIG) remains negligible. The SG's reply brief has resolved my main uncertainty. The key predictive task is no longer *whether* or even *how* the Court will reverse in a broad sense, but rather predicting the precise language and contours the Court will use when it adopts the SG's \"rule of reason\" / \"reasonably close causal relationship\" framework. The uncertainty has narrowed from the *choice* of standard to the *formulation* of the winning standard.",
