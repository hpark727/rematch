    "case_title": "Free Speech Coalition, Inc., et al., Petitioners v. Ken Paxton, Attorney General of Texas",
    "resolution_date": "Jun 27 2025",
    "legal_questions": [
      "Is a Texas law that requires any website that publishes content one-third or more of which is 'harmful to minors' to verify the age of each of its users before providing access subject to 'rational basis' review or 'strict scrutiny'?"
    ],
    "legal_answers": [
      "No"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "Texas enacted H.B. 1181, a law regulating commercial entities that publish or distribute material on internet websites, including social media platforms, where more than one-third of the content is sexual material harmful to minors. The law requires these entities to implement age verification methods to limit access to adults and display specific health warnings on their landing pages and advertisements. It defines sexual material harmful to minors using a modified version of the Miller test for obscenity.\n\nShortly after the law was enacted but before it took effect, plaintiffs sued, claiming H.B. 1181 violates their First Amendment rights and, for some plaintiffs, conflicts with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The district court issued a pre-enforcement preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim and suffer irreparable harm. The court ruled that the age-verification requirement and health warnings fail strict scrutiny\u2014that is, that it is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest using the least restrictive means to achieve that interest\u2014and that Section 230 preempts H.B. 1181 for certain plaintiffs. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that rational basis review\u2014i.e., rationally related to a legitimate government interest\u2014was the proper standard of review and thus vacated the injunction against the age-verification requirement but affirmed as to the health warnings.",

This provides a strong positive example of an effective workflow, which is highly valuable for improving the agent's general problem-solving methodology.\n\nJoint EIG is high (0.9) because, while the action doesn't directly inform the task prediction, formulating a coherent and efficient plan is a critical and high-value step in the overall process of optimal experimental design.",

The Task EIG is therefore extremely high (0.9), as it provides one of the two core pillars of the legal debate. The Design EIG is low (0.2) because the strategy itself\u2014'read the petitioner's brief to understand their arguments'\u2014is a fundamental and expected step in legal analysis, not a novel or complex strategy that would significantly refine my general approach to BOED.

Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002(a), \n129B.003.  An entity conducting age verification \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information of the individual,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 imposes no limits on \ntransmitting that information to others.  Nor does H.B. \n1181 establish any data-security requirements or \ndisclosure prohibitions for entities conducting age \nverification or others that receive identification \ninformation as part of the verification process. \nH.B. 1181 also mandates that covered websites post \nscripted \u201csexual materials health warnings\u201d on the \n\n8 \n \n \n\u201clanding page\u201d of the website and \u201call advertisements,\u201d \nalong with \u201chelpline\u201d numbers for \u201csubstance abuse and \nmental health.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered).  The purported \nwarnings state that \u201c[p]ornography is potentially \nbiologically addictive\u201d and \u201cproven to harm human \nbrain development.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.004(1); see id. \n(\u201cExposure to this content is associated with low self-\nesteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired \nbrain development, and other emotional and mental \nillnesses.\u201d).

Literature 236 (1973) ......................... 18\n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAmericans hold a wide range of views about sexual \ncontent online.  Some view it as offensive or indecent; \nfor others, it is artistic, informative, or even essential to \nimportant parts of career and life.  Consistent with the \nbedrock First Amendment principle that \u201cesthetic and \nmoral judgments about art and literature \u2026 are for the \nindividual to make, not for the Government to decree,\u201d \nthis Court has long treated non-obscene sexual content \nas constitutionally protected for adults.  United States \nv. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818 (2000).  And \nwhile the Court has held that states may limit minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual material reasonably found harmful to \nthem, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 638-39 (1968), \nthe Court has uniformly held that a content-based \nburden on adults\u2019 access to such protected speech \u201ccan \nstand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny,\u201d Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 665-66 \n(2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 874 (1997); Sable \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). \nEnacted in 2023, Texas House Bill (H.B.) 1181 \nimposes requirements on commercial websites \u201cmore \nthan one-third of which\u201d are \u201csexual material harmful \nto minors\u201d\u2014a term that includes all sexually suggestive \ncontent, as might be found in romance novels or R-rated \nmovies.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).  The \nlaw requires a covered website to verify the age of every \nuser, typically via government-issued identification.  Id.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 129B.002-003.  Entities conducting such verification \nmay not \u201cretain\u201d users\u2019 \u201cidentifying information,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 129B.002(b), but H.B. 1181 does not prohibit transfer \nof that information or impose any other protection \nagainst disclosure.  And while Texas insists that forcing \nusers to endure chilling online privacy and security \n\n2 \n \n \nrisks is necessary to protect minors from harmful \nsexual content, H.B. 1181 exempts the search engines \nand social-media platforms that are principal gateways \nfor minors\u2019 access to that very content.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nConfirming Texas\u2019s real aims, H.B. 1181 also requires \ncovered websites to post stigmatizing, unscientific \n\u201c[w]arnings\u201d that condemn their content as harmful to \nhealth.  Id. \u00a7 129B.004. \nThe district court preliminarily enjoined H.B. 1181, \nfinding that the law is subject to strict scrutiny and \nlikely to fail it under this Court\u2019s governing precedent.  \nIn particular, the court explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is materially identical to the \nChild Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, \nwhich this Court in Ashcroft held was subject to strict \nscrutiny and likely unconstitutional.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that H.B. 1181 is materially identical to COPA, \nbut a divided panel held that it was not bound by \nAshcroft because that decision contains what the \nmajority termed \u201cstartling omissions.\u201d  Pet. App. \n17a.  The majority concluded that the proper level of \nscrutiny is instead rational-basis review, as applied in \nGinsberg.  To justify its departure from Ashcroft, the \nmajority reasoned that this Court there applied strict \nscrutiny to COPA only because Attorney General \nAshcroft, represented by Solicitor General Olson, \nerroneously accepted strict scrutiny rather than urging \nmere rational-basis review in defense of the statute.   \nAs recognized by Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent, the \nFifth Circuit veered astray.  This Court in Ashcroft did \nnot apply strict scrutiny to COPA based on an oversight \nor concession.  It did so because First Amendment \nprinciples and precedent firmly establish that strict \nscrutiny \napplies \nto \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \n\n3 \n \n \nconstitutionally protected speech, specifically including \nsexual content that is not obscene for adults.  Neither \nTexas\u2019s professed aim to protect minors nor Ginsberg\u2019s \nholding\u2014which applies only to the rights of minors\u2014\nalters that analysis.  The laws in Ashcroft, Reno, \nPlayboy, and Sable all aimed to protect minors, and this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in each of those post-\nGinsberg decisions.  Strict scrutiny applies here too. \nUnder strict scrutiny, this is a straightforward \ncase.  As the district court found and the Fifth Circuit \ndid not question, H.B. 1181 is both overinclusive and \nunderinclusive, and it fails to pursue its objective with \nthe means least restrictive of adults\u2019 protected speech.  \nIndeed, Texas has disregarded the measure specifically \nidentified in Ashcroft as both less restrictive and more \neffective than online age-verification: content-filtering \nsoftware, which limits minors\u2019 access to sexual material \ninappropriate for them without burdening adults\u2019 \naccess to speech they have a right to receive.  That \nlegislative oversight is especially striking because \ncontent-filtering \ntechnology \nhas \nimproved \nsince \nAshcroft.  Meanwhile, online age-verification has grown \neasier to circumvent and threats of online identity theft, \nextortion, and data breaches have multiplied\u2014\nheightening chills in the highly sensitive and personal \ncontext of accessing sexual material. \nRestoring the preliminary injunction of H.B. 1181 by \nreversing the erroneous decision below would not \nundermine genuine efforts to limit minors\u2019 access to \nsexually inappropriate material.  Petitioners agree that \nprotecting minors is a compelling government interest \nand that\u2014as this Court expressly stated in Ashcroft\u2014a \nlaw narrowly tailored to that objective can survive strict \nscrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-73.  The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\n4 \n \n \napplication of rational-basis review is therefore as \nunnecessary as it is wrong.  As in other recent cases, the \nCourt should adhere to \u201csettled principles about \nfreedom of expression\u201d that have \u201cserved the Nation \nwell over many years\u201d and reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \njarring departure from First Amendment precedent.  \nMoody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, 2403 (2024).   \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion (Pet. App. 1a-87a) is \nreported at 95 F.4th 263.  The opinion of the district \ncourt granting a preliminary injunction (Pet. App. 90a-\n161a) is reported at 689 F. Supp. 3d 373. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit entered its judgment on March 7, \n2024.  Petitioners timely petitioned for certiorari on \nApril 12, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides in relevant part that \u201cCongress \nshall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d  \nH.B. 1181 is reproduced in an appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1.  \u201cThe most basic\u201d principle of free speech is that \n\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression \nbecause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or \nits content.\u201d  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, \n790-91 (2011) (citation omitted).  Generally, when a law \n\u201cimposes a restriction on the content of protected \n\n5 \n \n \nspeech, it is invalid unless \u2026 it passes strict scrutiny\u2014\nthat is, unless it is justified by a compelling government \ninterest and is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.\u201d  \nId. at 799.  Otherwise, content-based speech restrictions \nare permitted only in limited \u201chistoric and traditional \ncategories long familiar to the bar.\u201d  United States v. \nStevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (citation omitted).   \nOne such category is obscenity, defined as material \nthat \n\u201cdepicts \nor \ndescribes \n\u2026 \nsexual \ncontent\u201d \n(specifically identified by statute), in a \u201cpatently \noffensive\u201d way that \u201cappeals to the prurient interest,\u201d \nand, taken as a whole, \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\u201d  Miller v. California, 413 \nU.S. 15, 24 (1973) (citation omitted).  In Ginsberg, the \nCourt upheld a state law that \u201cadjusts the definition of \nobscenity\u201d applicable to minors based on their different \nreaction to sexual content.  Id. at 638 (citation omitted).  \nAs to adults, however, the Court has \u201cmade it perfectly \nclear that \u2018sexual expression which is \u2026 not obscene is \nprotected by the First Amendment.\u2019\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874 (brackets and citation omitted).  And the Court has \nrepeatedly held that laws imposing content-based \nburdens on adults\u2019 access to such constitutionally \nprotected expression are subject to strict scrutiny, even \nif the laws permissibly aim to restrict minors\u2019 access to \nsuch material.  Id.; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66; \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 813; Sable, 492 U.S. at 126. \nThe Court\u2019s most recent decision in that line of cases \nis Ashcroft.  There, the Court considered a challenge to \nCOPA, \nwhich \nprohibited\u2014absent \nage-verification \nmeasures\u2014the online transmission of content that \nCongress deemed obscene for minors using a modified \nobscenity standard like the one at issue in Ginsberg.  \n542 U.S. at 661-62.  Because COPA burdened adults\u2019 \n\n6 \n \n \naccess to speech constitutionally protected for them, the \nCourt held that strict scrutiny applied for the same \nreasons as in analogous prior cases.  Id. at 665-66 (citing \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874); see id. at 670 (citing Playboy, \n529 U.S. at 825-26).  The Court then upheld a \npreliminary injunction of COPA, determining that the \nstatute was likely unconstitutional because \u201cless \nrestrictive \nalternatives\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, \ncontent-\nfiltering software\u2014\u201cwould be at least as effective in \nachieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was \nenacted to serve.\u201d  Id. at 665 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874); see id. at 665-66, 673. \n2.  Almost 20 years after Ashcroft, in June 2023, \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181.  H.B. 1181 requires age \nverification by any commercial website \u201cmore than one-\nthird of which is sexual material harmful to minors,\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a), defined \nusing almost exactly the same modification of the adult \nobscenity standard that Congress adopted in COPA, id. \n\u00a7 129B.001(6).1  Because this statutory definition \napplies to even the youngest minors, for whom almost \n \n1  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful \nto minors\u201d as including material that \u201c(A) the average person \napplying contemporary community standards would find, taking \nthe material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to \nappeal to or pander to the prurient interest; (B) in a manner \npatently offensive with respect to minors, exploits, is devoted to, \nor principally consists of descriptions of actual, simulated, or \nanimated displays or depictions of: (i) a person\u2019s pubic hair, anus, \nor genitals or the nipple of the female breast; (ii) touching, \ncaressing, or fondling of nipples, breasts, buttocks, anuses, or \ngenitals; or (iii) sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, \nbestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, excretory functions, \nexhibitions, or any other sexual act; and (C) taken as a whole, lacks \nserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.001(6). \n\n7 \n \n \nany sexual content could qualify as obscene, H.B. 1181 \ncovers \u201call salacious material,\u201d from sex-education \ncontent to simulated sex scenes in Oscar-winning films.  \nPet. App. 109a, 115a.  And because H.B. 1181 applies to \nany website that devotes any more than one-third of its \ncontent to such sexual material, its restrictions apply to \nbroad swaths of speech that are not sexual\u2014much less \nobscene, even as to minors.  \nH.B. 1181 also contains several conspicuous \nexemptions.  It expressly exempts search engines, Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.005(b), even though they \ncan provide access to the same sexual content as \ncovered websites, see Pet. App. 112a.  And the law de \nfacto exempts social-media sites that contain less than \none-third sexual material, even if those sites contain a \nlarger total volume of sexual content (including the \nsame content) as covered websites.  Pet. App. 113a. \nTo comply with \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement, covered websites must \u201cverify that an \nindividual attempting to access the [site] is\u201d at least 18 \nyears old using \u201cdigital identification,\u201d \u201cgovernment-\nissued identification,\u201d or \u201ca commercially reasonable \nmethod that relies on public or private transactional \ndata.\u201d  Tex.

A \u201csubstantial \nchilling effect\u201d results from demanding proof of \nindividual identity online: Adults who submit, for \nexample, a \u201cgovernment ID\u201d over the Internet to \n\u201caffirmatively identify themselves\u201d understand that \nthey are thereby exposing themselves to \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks.\u201d  Pet. App. 125a-126a.  The \nchilling effect is worse than ever now because Internet \n\u201c[u]sers today are more cognizant of privacy concerns\u201d \nand \u201cdata breaches have become more high-profile\u201d and \ncommonplace.  Pet. App. 127a.  Adults\u2019 reasonable \nconcerns are compounded by H.B. 1181\u2019s failure to \nprohibit the transmission of adults\u2019 information to third \n\n9 \n \n \nparties\u2014including the government, creating the risk of \n\u201cstate monitoring\u201d of \u201cwhat kind of websites they visit.\u201d  \nPet.

Correspondingly, such \ninformation is \u201cmore likely to be targeted\u201d by identity \nthieves and extortionists because \u201cusers may be more \nwilling to pay to keep that information private.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 127a. \nB. Procedural History \n1. District Court Proceedings \nPetitioners challenged H.B. 1181 soon after it was \nsigned.  Pet. App. 90a.  After an evidentiary hearing, the \ndistrict court issued an order preliminarily enjoining \nenforcement of H.B. 1181 before it became effective, \naccompanied by a lengthy decision explaining the \nfactual findings and legal reasoning underlying the \norder.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.  \na.  The district court held that petitioners are likely \nto succeed on the merits.  Under Reno and Ashcroft, the \ncourt explained, H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny \nbecause it is a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nprotected speech.  Pet. App. 107a-111a.  While crediting \nTexas\u2019s compelling interest in protecting minors from \nharmful content, the court held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification mandate likely does not withstand strict \nscrutiny because it is an underinclusive and overly \nrestrictive means of pursuing that interest, particularly \ngiven the availability of more effective, less restrictive \nalternatives.  Pet. App. 111a-136a.   \nThe district court first explained that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions of search engines and social media render it \n\n10 \n \n \n\u201cseverely underinclusive.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a-114a.  The \ncourt found that minors can easily locate \u201csexually \nexplicit or pornographic\u201d content on search engines \nthrough \u201cvisual search\u201d\u2014i.e., a search for images or \nvideos.  Pet. App. 112a.  The court also found that social-\nmedia platforms like Instagram and Facebook contain \n\u201cmaterial which is sexually explicit for minors,\u201d and \nsites like Reddit \u201cmaintain entire communities and \nforums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online pornography.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 113a.  Because such outlets are the most frequent \nsources for minors to access sexual content, yet none is \nregulated by H.B. 1181, the court found that the law \n\u201cfails to reduce the online pornography that is most \nreadily available to minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.   \nThe district court similarly found that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is overly restrictive \nbecause it \u201csweeps far beyond obscene material and \nincludes all content offensive to minors, while failing to \nexempt material that has cultural, scientific, or \neducational value to adults only.\u201d  Pet. App. 122a.  The \ncourt added that the Texas legislature did not \u201ceven \nconsider[] the law\u2019s tailoring or ma[ke] any effort \nwhatsoever to choose the least-restrictive measure.\u201d  \nPet. App. 135a.  Indeed, the court found that Texas\u2019s \nown evidence\u2014along with petitioners\u2019\u2014identified less \nrestrictive and more effective alternatives.  In \nparticular, the legislature paid no heed to updated and \nimproved forms of the content-filtering software that \nthis Court found superior to online age-verification in \nAshcroft.  Pet. App. 128a-135a.  While Texas contended \nthat changes in technology should alter the judicial \nanalysis\u2014positing age verification as \u201cmore secure and \nconvenient\u201d and content filtering as obsolete\u2014the court \nfound that Texas\u2019s argument \u201csimply does not match \nthe evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a.   \n\n11 \n \n \nb.  The district court also held that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nmandated health warnings are likely unconstitutionally \ncompelled speech.  Pet. App. 136a-150a.  Under \nNational Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. \nBecerra, 585 U.S. 755 (2018) (NIFLA), the court held \nthat the speech mandate is subject to strict scrutiny, \nwhich it likely cannot survive.  Pet. App. 137a-143a.  The \ncourt emphasized that, as a result of the age verification \nrequired by H.B. 1181, the warnings would be seen \npredominantly by adults, contrary to H.B. 1181\u2019s stated \npurpose of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 142a.  And even \nif the warnings are treated as a commercial-speech \nmandate subject to lesser scrutiny, the court held they \ncannot survive because they are not \u201cpurely factual and \nuncontroversial.\u201d  Pet. App. 145a (quoting Zauderer v. \nOff. of Disciplinary Couns., 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985)). \nc.  Finally, the district court held that a preliminary \ninjunction is justified because H.B. 1181, if enforced, \nwill cause irreparable harm to petitioners and adult \nTexans by chilling access to protected sexual expression \nand compelling speech.  Pet. App. 156a.  In enjoining \nH.B. 1181, the court noted that \u201cnothing in th[e court\u2019s] \norder prevents the state from pursuing\u201d the other \n\u201cviable and constitutional means\u201d available \u201cto achieve \nTexas\u2019s goal\u201d of protecting minors.  Pet. App. 160a. \n2. Court Of Appeals Proceedings \na.  Texas appealed and sought a stay pending appeal \nfrom the Fifth Circuit.  See Pet. App. 167a-168a.  The \nmotions panel entered an administrative stay without \nany stated reasons, lasting nearly two months, during \nwhich time the parties briefed and argued the appeal.  \nPet. App. 167a-168a.  The merits panel then issued an \nunexplained stay pending appeal by a 2-1 vote, which \nlasted roughly another four months.  Pet. App. 166a & \n\n12 \n \n \nn.1 (noting Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissenting vote).  \nDuring this period, Texas began enforcement actions.  \nSee C.A. Dkt. #131. \nb.  On March 7, 2024, the Fifth Circuit merits panel \nupheld the preliminary injunction unanimously as to the \nhealth-warning provision, Pet. App. 27a-38a, but held by \na 2-1 vote that petitioners were unlikely to succeed in \nchallenging the age-verification provision, Pet. App. 8a-\n27a.  The panel accordingly vacated the preliminary \ninjunction as to the age-verification provision over \nJudge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent.  Pet. App. 44a. \nThe panel majority acknowledged that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the \nCOPA provisions addressed by this Court in Ashcroft, \nrejecting Texas\u2019s purported distinctions of the two \nstatutes.  Pet. App. 16a.  Nevertheless, the majority \nheld that rational-basis review is the applicable \nstandard of scrutiny given Ginsberg.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  \nThe majority acknowledged that its holding departs \nfrom Ashcroft, but it declined to follow this Court\u2019s \ndecision in that case.  Pet. App. 16a-19a.  It deemed the \nAshcroft Court\u2019s lack of \u201cdiscussion of rational-basis \nreview under Ginsberg\u201d a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that \ncould \u201conly\u201d be explained by the failure of the United \nStates to argue for the application of rational-basis \nreview\u2014a non-jurisdictional error that the Court \npurportedly \u201cdid not have to correct\u201d on its own.  Pet. \nApp. 17a-18a.      \nThe panel majority similarly declined to apply other \nprecedents holding that strict scrutiny applies to \ncontent-based \nburdens \non \nadults\u2019 \naccess \nto \nconstitutionally protected sexual expression.  Pet. App. \n13a-16a, 20a-26a (discussing Reno, Playboy, and Sable).  \nThe majority contended that none of these cases could \n\n13 \n \n \n\u201csurmount the rock that is Ginsberg.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nThe majority then held that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovision \u201ceasily\u201d survives rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 26a.   \nJudge Higginbotham dissented, relying on Sable, \nReno, Playboy, and Ashcroft.  Pet. App. 45a-87a.  H.B. \n1181 \u201cmust face strict scrutiny review,\u201d he explained, \n\u201cbecause it limits adults\u2019 access to protected speech \nusing a content-based distinction.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a-48a.  \nHe added that Ginsberg \u201chas no purchase\u201d in \naddressing \u201ca challenge to an adult\u2019s ability to access \nconstitutionally protected materials\u201d online, because \nGinsberg held \u201cthat minors have more limited First \nAmendment rights than adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 56a-57a.  \nFinding no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings, he \nwould have affirmed the preliminary injunction in full.  \nPet. App. 68a-78a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nH.B. \n1181\u2019s \nage-verification \nrequirement \nis \nunconstitutional under a straightforward application of \nFirst Amendment principles and precedent.  The \npreliminary injunction should accordingly be restored. \nA.  When speech is protected by the First \nAmendment, a content-based burden on that speech \ntriggers strict scrutiny.  H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nrequirement fits squarely within that rule.  The age-\nverification requirement is triggered by speech that \nTexas has deemed inappropriate for minors but that is \nconstitutionally protected for adults.  It is facially \ncontent-based, applying only to specified sexual \nmaterial.  And it imposes a clear burden, forcing adult \nusers to incur severe privacy and security risks\u2014which \n\n14 \n \n \nthe statute leaves largely unaddressed\u2014before they \ncan access constitutionally protected speech. \nBasic principles of free speech thus call for strict \nscrutiny.  And this Court\u2019s precedent removes all \ndoubt.  In an unbroken line of cases dating back \ndecades, the Court has uniformly applied strict scrutiny \nto laws that do what H.B. 1181 does\u2014burden adults\u2019 \naccess to non-obscene sexual content, which is \nconstitutionally protected for them, while attempting to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to that content.  That line of \ncases culminated in Ashcroft, in which eight Justices \napplied \nstrict \nscrutiny \nto \na \nlaw \nmaterially \nindistinguishable from H.B. 1181. \nWithout attempting to distinguish Ashcroft, the \nFifth Circuit dismissed it by speculating that this Court \ndid not really mean that strict scrutiny applies to laws \nlike COPA and H.B. 1181.  That position is as \nremarkable as it is mistaken.  Lower federal courts \nmay not disregard this Court\u2019s decisions, even if they \n(mis)perceive \n\u201comissions\u201d \nin \nthe \nCourt\u2019s \nreasoning.  Pet. App. 17a.  Regardless, Ashcroft \nevidences no omission.  The Ashcroft Court subjected \nCOPA to strict scrutiny because that is what the First \nAmendment requires, as the United States recognized \nin defending the statute.  The Court did not adopt the \nrational-basis review standard of Ginsberg, because \nthat standard applies to the definition of obscenity for \nminors\u2014not the imposition of burdens on adults, as this \nCourt\u2019s post-Ginsberg decisions in Reno, Playboy, and \nSable confirm. \nB.  Under the proper standard of strict scrutiny, \nthis case is readily resolved.  As the district court found \nand the Fifth Circuit did not refute, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is triply flawed: it is \n\n15 \n \n \noverinclusive, underinclusive, and not the least \nrestrictive means of pursuing the state\u2019s interest in \nprotecting minors.  It is overinclusive because\u2014\nthrough its application to entire websites that have \nmore than one-third content inappropriate for minors\u2014\nit restricts adults\u2019 access to speech that is not even \nsexual and not even arguably obscene for minors.  It is \nunderinclusive because it exempts search engines and \nsocial-media sites that make available to minors huge \nquantities of the same content that the statute restricts \non petitioners\u2019 websites.  And it fails to adopt less \nrestrictive \nand \nmore \neffective \nalternatives \nto \nburdensome online age-verification, such as the \ncontent-filtering software that this Court identified in \nAshcroft.  Each of those defects is independently fatal; \ntogether, they underscore that H.B. 1181 is designed \nforemost to target disfavored speakers\u2014whom the law \nbrands with self-condemning \u201chealth warnings\u201d\u2014\nrather than to meet the state\u2019s purported objective.  \nSuch speaker-based discrimination affords yet another \nreason why petitioners\u2019 challenge will likely succeed. \nC.  Petitioners satisfy the remaining requirements \nfor a preliminary injunction.  They, along with Texas \nadults, are irreparably harmed by the loss of their First \nAmendment freedoms and the prospect of crippling \nenforcement \nproceedings \nand \nunrecoverable \ncompliance costs.  Moreover, the equities and public \ninterest strongly favor enjoining enforcement of the \nstatute until the litigation is complete\u2014just as was true \nfor the comparable laws in Reno and Ashcroft. \n\n16 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nTHE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OF THE AGE-\nVERIFICATION REQUIREMENT IN H.B. 1181 \nSHOULD BE RESTORED \nA \u201cplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that \nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\u201d  \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008).  Here, as in most First Amendment cases, the \nprincipal \nquestion \nis \nwhether \npetitioners \nhave \n\u201cdemonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.  As the district court \ncorrectly concluded, they have.  Because petitioners \nalso satisfy the relevant equitable factors, the \npreliminary injunction should be restored.  See Pet. App. \n45a-87a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). \nA. The Age-Verification Requirement In H.B. \n1181 Is Subject To Strict Scrutiny \n1. Strict Scrutiny Applies To Content-Based \nBurdens On Protected Speech  \na.  \u201cThe First Amendment, applicable to the States \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \nthat abridge the freedom of speech.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. \nat 766. It is a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d of the First \nAmendment that states typically cannot restrict \nprotected speech \u201cbecause of its message, its ideas, its \nsubject matter, or its content.\u201d  NIFLA, 585 U.S. at 766 \n(quoting Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972)).  \nSuch restrictions \u201care presumptively unconstitutional\u201d \nand generally may be justified only if they overcome the \n\u201cstringent standard\u201d of strict scrutiny.  Id.  The Court \n\n17 \n \n \nhas applied that principle to speech of many different \nforms, from outdoor signs to violent video games to \ndepictions of animal cruelty to sexually suggestive \ncontent on television and the Internet\u2014just to name a \nfew examples from recent years.  See Reed v. Town of \nGilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 159 (2015); Brown, 564 U.S. at 799; \nStevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813-14; \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874; see also Barr v. Am. Ass\u2019n of Pol. \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 618-19 (2020) (plurality \nopinion) (applying strict scrutiny to restrictions on \nrobocalls); id. at 650 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the \njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (same).  In \nshort, the First Amendment generally \u201cbars the \ngovernment from dictating what we see or read or \nspeak or hear.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coal., 535 U.S. \n234, 245 (2002).  \nThe First Amendment confers that broad protection \nnot because any \u201cone idea is as good as any other\u201d;  the \n\u201cConstitution no more enforces a relativistic philosophy \nor moral nihilism than it does any other point of view.\u201d  \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  The First Amendment \nbroadly protects speech because \u201cit is difficult to \ndistinguish\u201d high-value speech from low-value speech \nand \u201cdangerous\u201d for the government \u201cto try.\u201d  Brown, \n564 U.S. at 790.  \u201cWhat is one man\u2019s amusement, \nteaches another\u2019s doctrine.\u201d  Id. (quoting Winters v. \nNew York, 333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948)).  The First \nAmendment \u201cexists precisely so that opinions and \njudgments, including esthetic and moral judgments \nabout art and literature, can be formed, tested, and \nexpressed.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 818.  And, with few \nexceptions, those \u201cjudgments are for the individual to \nmake, not for the Government to decree, even with the \nmandate or approval of a majority.\u201d  Id. \n\n18 \n \n \nb.  The Court has long applied these principles to \nspeech involving sex.  Although obscenity is historically \nunprotected, \u201csex and obscenity are not synonymous,\u201d \nand the non-obscene \u201cportrayal of sex \u2026 in art, \nliterature, and scientific works\u201d has never been \nregarded as \u201csufficient reason to deny material the \nconstitutional protection of freedom of speech and \npress.\u201d  Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957).  \nTo the contrary, sex has been \u201ca subject of absorbing \ninterest to mankind through the ages\u201d and remains \u201cone \nof the vital problems of human interest and public \nconcern.\u201d  Id.; see, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78 \n(collecting examples of sexual material \u201cwith serious \neducational or other value\u201d); see also Free Speech Coal., \n535 U.S. at 246-48 (2002) (discussing the theme of sex in \nart and literature dating back to Shakespeare).   \n\u201cSexual expression and imagery were common, \nwidespread, legal, and quite explicit\u201d before and during \nthe Founding era.  Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the First \nAmendment, 17 First Amend. L. Rev. 134, 135 (2022).  \nAmerican colonial bookstores \u201ccarried an extraordinary \narray of erotica,\u201d id., and prominent figures \u201clike \nBenjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson collected \nmany [such] works,\u201d Geoffrey R. Stone, Sex and the \nConstitution 83 (2017).  Jefferson\u2019s library, for example, \ncontained numerous publications that \u201cportrayed vivid \nscenes of sexuality, lust, and sexual scandal.\u201d  Id.; see 4 \nCatalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson 433-36, \n447, 456, 553-54 (E. Millicent Sowerby ed., 1955).  And \nmany Americans \u201cread sex manuals\u201d such as Aristotle\u2019s \nMasterpiece\u2014an \u201cerotic\u201d anthology understood to have \nmedical value.  Vern L. Bullough, An Early American \nSex Manual, Or, Aristotle Who?, 7 Early Am. \nLiterature 236, 236, 241 (1973); see John D\u2019Amelio & \nEstelle B. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of \n\n19 \n \n \nSexuality in America 19 (1988) (describing that \u201chighly \npopular\u201d work as \u201ca compendium of reproductive lore\u201d).  \nObjections to such non-obscene sexual publications on \nreligious, moral, aesthetic, and other grounds were \ngenerally pursued through private restrictions, not \npublic laws; \u201cthe distribution, exhibition, and possession \nof pornographic material was simply not thought to be \nany of the state\u2019s business.\u201d  Sex and the First \nAmendment, supra, at 135.   \nIn keeping with that history and understanding, this \nCourt has exercised \u201c[c]easeless vigilance\u201d to protect \nadults\u2019 access to sexual material that does not fall within \nthe definition of obscenity, Roth, 354 U.S. at 488, even \nthough some may \u201cfind [it] shabby, offensive, or even \nugly,\u201d Playboy, 529 U.S. at 826.  That is consistent with \nthe \n\u201cbedrock \nprinciple \nunderlying \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment \u2026 that the government may not prohibit \nthe expression of an idea simply because society finds \nthe idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\u201d  Snyder v. \nPhelps, 562 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (quoting Texas v. \nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989)); see Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 245 (\u201c[S]peech may not be prohibited \nbecause \nit \nconcerns \nsubjects \noffending \nour \nsensibilities.\u201d).  Indeed, \u201cthe point of all speech \nprotection ... is to shield just those choices of content \nthat in someone\u2019s eyes are misguided, or even hurtful.\u201d  \nSnyder, 562 U.S. at 458 (citation omitted); see 303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 602 (2023) (\u201cA \ncommitment to speech for only some messages and \nsome persons is no commitment at all.\u201d). \nc.  The distinction between unprotected obscenity \nand protected speech about sex applies to people of all \nages.  In Ginsberg, however, this Court held that the \nline can be drawn in a different place with respect to \n\n20 \n \n \nminors.  390 U.S. at 638.  The Court in Ginsberg upheld \na New York law that prohibited the knowing sale to \nminors of sexual material \u201cdefined to be obscene on the \nbasis of its appeal to them whether or not it would be \nobscene to adults.\u201d  Id. at 631.  Rejecting a challenge \nasserted on behalf of minors, the Court determined that \nthe law permissibly \u201cadjusts the definition of obscenity \n\u2018to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type \nof material to be assessed in term of the sexual \ninterests\u2019\u201d of minors, which differ from those of adults.  \nId. at 638 (quoting Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, \n509 (1966)).  Because the line drawn by the state has a \n\u201crational relation to the objective of safeguarding such \nminors from harm,\u201d the Court held, the law did not \nviolate minors\u2019 First Amendment rights.  Id. at 643. \nThe Court\u2019s decision in Ginsberg marks an exception \nto the general principle that minors and adults enjoy the \nsame First Amendment protections, and the Court has \ndeclined to extend Ginsberg beyond the narrow context \nin which it was decided.  See Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-95 \n(rejecting California\u2019s reliance on Ginsberg to prohibit \nthe sale of violent video games to minors).  Most \ncritically for present purposes, however, Ginsberg\u2019s \ntolerance of a more restrictive obscenity definition for \nminors does not in any way diminish the constitutional \nprotection of non-obscene sexual expression for adults.  \nThe law at issue in Ginsberg did not place any \nrestriction on adults\u2019 access to sexual materials; it did \nnot, for example, require sellers to conduct age \nverification of adult customers.  See 390 U.S. at 634.  To \nthe \ncontrary, \nthe \nGinsberg \nCourt \nexpressly \ndistinguished New York\u2019s restriction on minors\u2019 access \nto sexual content from a Michigan law that barred the \nsale to adults and minors of content deemed harmful to \nminors, id.\u2014a law the Court unanimously invalidated as \n\n21 \n \n \nviolating the First Amendment.  Butler v. Michigan, \n352 U.S. 380, 383-84 (1957) (refusing to \u201creduce the \nadult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit \nfor children,\u201d which would impermissibly \u201cburn the \nhouse to roast the pig\u201d). \nThe Court has since reaffirmed in an unbroken line \nof ensuing decisions that a burden on adults\u2019 access to \nsexual material constitutionally protected for them is \nsubject to strict scrutiny even if that burden arises from \na law aimed at restricting minors\u2019 access to sexual \nmaterial that is not constitutionally protected for them.  \nSee, e.g., Reno, 521 U.S. at 975 (\u201c[T]he level of discourse \nreaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that \nwhich would be suitable for a sandbox.\u201d (quoting Bolger \nv. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 74-75 (1983)).   \nIn Sable, for example, the Court considered a \nfederal law prohibiting \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d telephone services \ncontaining content that was constitutionally protected \nfor adults but inappropriate for minors.  492 U.S. at 117, \n126.  Given the burden on adults, the Court subjected \nthe law to strict scrutiny.  Id. at 126.  And while the \nCourt accepted the government\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest \nin protecting the physical and psychological well-being \nof minors,\u201d the Court invalidated the law because it \n\u201cwas not sufficiently narrowly drawn \u2026 to serve those \ninterests without unnecessarily interfering with [the] \nFirst Amendment freedoms\u201d of adults.  Id. \nThe Court followed the same approach in Playboy.  \nThere, a federal law required cable-television operators \noffering \nchannels \n\u201cprimarily \ndedicated \nto\u201d \nprogramming that was \u201csexually-oriented\u201d but not \nobscene for adults to either block their channels or \nbroadcast them only late at night, when children were \nnot likely to be watching.  529 U.S. at 806.  The Court \n\n22 \n \n \nagain acknowledged the government\u2019s interest in \nstopping \u201cunwanted, indecent speech\u201d from entering \n\u201cthe home without parental consent,\u201d but emphasized \nthat, because the law burdened adults\u2019 access to sexual \nexpression that is constitutionally protected for them, \nthe \u201cstandard the Government must meet\u201d to restrict \nthat speech \u201cshould be clear:  The standard is strict \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The Court rejected the argument \nthat a lower level of scrutiny should apply because \nadults could still watch the programming late at night; \nthe Court explained that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-\nbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny \nas its content-based bans.\u201d  Id. at 812.  After finding \nthat effective, less restrictive alternatives existed\u2014for \nexample, \u201ca regime in which viewers could order signal \nblocking on a household-by-household basis\u201d\u2014the \nCourt invalidated the law.  Id. at 807, 826-27. \nIn Reno, the Court extended those principles to \nsexual content specifically on the Internet.  The Court \naffirmed a preliminary injunction of a federal law that \n\u201cprohibit[ed] the knowing transmission of obscene or \nindecent messages\u201d online \u201cto any recipient under 18 \nyears of age,\u201d unless certain age-verification measures \nwere employed.  Reno, 521 U.S. at 859-61.  While \nrecognizing Ginsberg\u2019s holding that the \u201cscope of the \nconstitutional freedom of expression secured to a citizen\u201d \nto access sexually explicit material may \u201cdepend on \nwhether the citizen is an adult or a minor,\u201d the Reno \nCourt followed Playboy and Sable by applying strict \nscrutiny to the statute because it burdened adults\u2019 \naccess to speech that was constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Id. at 864-65, 874-77.  The Court affirmed the \npreliminary injunction, noting the government had \nfailed \u201cto explain why a less restrictive\u201d measure such \n\n23 \n \n \nas content \u201ctagg[ing],\u201d a nascent form of content \nfiltering, would not similarly protect minors.  Id. at 879. \nMost recently, the Court applied the same principles \nto COPA in Ashcroft.  As noted above, COPA prohibited \nthe online transmission of content deemed obscene for \nminors\u2014using Miller\u2019s adult-obscenity standard from \nthe perspective of a minor\u2014unless age-verification \nmeasures were employed.  See pp. 5-6, supra.  As in \nReno, Playboy, and Sable, the Ashcroft Court applied \nstrict scrutiny based on the law\u2019s burden on adults\u2019 \naccess to protected speech.  542 U.S. at 665-66.  The \nCourt then affirmed a preliminary injunction of COPA.  \nIt explained that the use of \u201cblocking and filtering \nsoftware\u201d would be an effective and less restrictive \nmeans of restricting minors\u2019 access to online sexual \ncontent inappropriate for them, while still allowing \nadults to access the \u201cspeech they have a right to see \nwithout having to identify themselves\u201d and thereby \nincur \u201cthe potential chilling effect\u201d of age verification.  \nId. at 666-67.2 \nTaken together, the teaching of those cases is \nunmistakable:  Strict scrutiny applies to laws that \nburden adults\u2019 right to access sexual expression that is \nconstitutionally protected for them, even if those laws \nare aimed at preventing minors\u2019 exposure to that \ncontent.  Indeed, prior to the majority decision below, \nevery court of appeals that encountered a similar law \nreviewed it under strict scrutiny.  See Mukasey, 534 F.3d \nat 190; PSInet v. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 229, 233-34 \n \n2  Following remand, the district court permanently enjoined \nCOPA, the Third Circuit affirmed under strict scrutiny, and this \nCourt denied review.  See ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, 190, \n207 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1137 (2009). \n\n24 \n \n \n(4th Cir. 2004); Am. Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 \nF.3d 96, 99-102 (2d Cir. 2003); ACLU v. Johnson, 194 \nF.3d 1149, 1152, 1155-58 (10th Cir. 1999).   \n2. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Requirement \nIs A Content-Based Burden On Protected \nSpeech Subject To Strict Scrutiny \nLike the laws in Ashcroft, Playboy, Reno, and Sable, \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement applies to \nspeech that is constitutionally protected for adults and \nimposes a content-based burden on adults\u2019 access to \nthat speech.  It is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.   \na.  The speech covered by H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is constitutionally protected \nfor adults.  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 applies to speech that \nsatisfies the Miller adult-obscenity test modified to \ncover sexual material that is deemed harmful from the \nperspective of a minor.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.001(6); see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 661-62.  H.B. \n1181, moreover, applies to minors generally\u2014with no \ndistinction between, e.g., a 17-year-old and a 5-year-\nold\u2014so content that would be harmful to even the \nyoungest minor is covered by the statute.  \u201cBecause \nmost sexual content is offensive to young minors, the \nlaw covers virtually all salacious material,\u201d Pet App. \n109a, from nude modeling to romance novels to R-rated \nmovies or television shows for mature audiences, id. at \n51a-52a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  That material \nis all undisputedly protected for adults. \nNor is H.B. 1181 directed at speech that is obscene \nfor adults.  Texas separately criminalizes such obscenity, \nleaving no need to subject it to age verification.  Tex. \nPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 43.21-43.23.  As such, adult obscenity is \nnot part of the constitutional analysis.  See Free Speech \n\n25 \n \n \nCoal., 535 U.S. at 240 (not considering obscene speech \nin the constitutional analysis because the statute at \nissue \u201cis not directed at speech that is obscene\u201d and \n\u201cCongress has proscribed those materials through a \nseparate statute\u201d); Reno, 521 U.S. at 878 n.44 (similar).  \nThe point is so plain that Texas conceded it at oral \nargument below.  Asked whether \u201cthe state take[s] the \nposition that the adults should be able to access all of \nth[e] material\u201d covered by H.B. 1181, or instead \u201cthat \nsome of th[e covered material] is obscene,\u201d the state \nresponded: \u201cadults should still be able to access every \nbit of the materials.\u201d  Official Recording at 13:35-14:00, \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. \nb.  It is equally clear that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification requirement is content-based.  The \nrequirement applies only to websites that provide \n\u201csexual material harmful to minors.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.001(6), 129B.002(a).  This definition \nis content-based on its face and indistinguishable from \nthe one that triggered strict scrutiny in Ashcroft; it is \nlikewise of a piece with the restrictions that triggered \nstrict scrutiny in Reno, Playboy, and Sable.  What is \nmore, H.B. 1181\u2019s content-based definition is especially \nbroad:  it sweeps in all of a website\u2019s non-sexual content \njust because more than one-third of the website \ncontains the targeted sexual content.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(a).3   \nc.  Nor can there be any serious dispute that H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement imposes a burden.  \nCovered websites must require adults to provide their \n \n3  The \u201chealth-warnings\u201d mandate likewise applies based on \nthe content of websites\u2019 speech and further compels the utterance \nof particular words.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.004.   \n\n26 \n \n \npersonally identifying information whenever they wish \nto access constitutionally protected sexual speech.  As \nis clear from the district court\u2019s unchallenged \nfindings\u2014along with common sense and experience\u2014\nmany adults will understandably be reluctant to do so.  \nPet. \nApp. \n124a-127a. \n \nSubmitting \nidentifying \ninformation online entails risks of \u201cinadvertent \ndisclosures, leaks, or hacks,\u201d all of which are heightened \nbecause the disclosure of personal information here \ncould \u201creveal intimate desires and preferences.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 125a-126a; see Electronic Frontier Found. (EFF) \nCert. Amicus Br. 6 (elaborating security risks). \nH.B. 1181 does little to assuage these concerns.  \nWhile requiring that age-verification providers \u201cmay \nnot retain any identifying information,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code \u00a7 129B.002(b), H.B. 1181 does not prohibit \nthe transmission of such information to third parties, \nincluding to criminals or the state.  It is \u201cdubious,\u201d \nmoreover, that adults will \u201ctrust that companies will \nactually delete it.\u201d  Pet. App. 126a.  Beyond creating \nrisks of potentially devastating identify theft and \nextortion, the law ushers in the chilling prospect that \n\u201cthe state government can log and track adults\u2019 access \nto sexual material.\u201d  Pet. App. 75a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting).  And even if those worst-case scenarios are \nnot realized, their specter will have a significant (and \nostensibly designed) deterrent effect.  Pet. App. 126a; \nsee, e.g., Denver Area Educ. Telecomms. Consortium, \nInc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 754 (1996) (crediting such \nrisks in the context of adults\u2019 access to sexual content).4   \n \n4   The \u201chealth-warnings mandate,\u201d which demands that \nwebsites stigmatize and condemn adult users by \u201cwarning\u201d them \naway, confirms that such deterrence is by design. \n\n27 \n \n \nFor many adults, moreover, H.B. 1181 \u201coperates as \na de facto ban.\u201d  Found. for Individual Rights and \nExpression (FIRE) Cert. Amicus Br. 8.  \u201cTexans who do \nnot possess government identification or whose age or \nidentity are not reliably confirmed by commercial age-\nverification systems will be functionally prohibited from \nvisiting sites\u201d subject to the law.  Id.  This is not \nhypothetical: \u201c[a]bout 15 million adult citizens do not \nhave a driver\u2019s license, while about 2.6 million do not \nhave any form of government-issued photo ID.\u201d  EFF \nCert. Amicus Br. 10.  \nIn sum, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement \nimposes a content-based burden on the right of adults \nto access speech that is constitutionally protected for \nthem.  Under this Court\u2019s consistent precedent, H.B. \n1181 is therefore subject to strict scrutiny.  See p. 24, \nsupra; see also Pet. App. 47a-48a (Higginbotham, J., \ndissenting); Pet. App. 108a.   \n3. The Fifth Circuit Erred In Applying \nRational-Basis Review To H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-\nVerification Requirement  \nThe Fifth Circuit declined to follow this Court\u2019s well-\nestablished precedent, applying rational-basis review \nrather than strict scrutiny.  Although the court provided \nseveral justifications for its position, none has merit. \na.  As a threshold matter, the Fifth Circuit squarely \ndefied this Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft, which the panel \nmajority acknowledged applied strict scrutiny to a \nmaterially indistinguishable law.  Pet. App. 4a, 16a.  The \nmajority\u2019s stated basis for doing so was that Ashcroft\u2019s \nfailure to apply rational-basis review under Ginsberg \nwas a \u201cstartling omission[]\u201d that could be explained only \nby the United States\u2019 failure to argue that rational-basis \n\n28 \n \n \nreview applied to COPA; on that view, the majority \ndeemed itself free to adopt a different approach and to \ncredit Texas\u2019s proposal for applying rational-basis \nreview here.  Pet. App. 17a, 26a.  That was not the \ncorrect treatment of this Court\u2019s precedent. \nTo begin, lower federal courts are bound by the \nreasoning and result of this Court\u2019s decisions under the \nprinciple of \u201cvertical stare decisis.\u201d  Ramos v. \nLouisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 124 n.5 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring in part); see, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, \n517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996) (\u201cWhen an opinion issues for the \nCourt, it is not only the result but also those portions of \nthe opinion necessary to that result by which we are \nbound.\u201d).  As such, the Fifth Circuit was not free to \ndisregard Ashcroft or any other decision of this Court \nbased on perceived weaknesses in the Court\u2019s analysis.  \nSee, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).   \nIn any event, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of Ashcroft \nis wrong.  The United States\u2019 brief in Ashcroft makes \nclear that the reason the government declined to argue \nfor rational-basis review was not an oversight but \ninstead a recognition that this Court had clearly and \nrepeatedly held that strict scrutiny applies to laws like \nCOPA.  See U.S. Br. 18, Ashcroft, supra (No. 03-218) \n(\u201c[B]ecause [COPA] regulates on the basis of content, \n[it] \u2018must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling \ngovernment interest\u2019 in order to be constitutional under \nthe First Amendment.\u201d (quoting Playboy, 529 U.S. at \n813)).  The Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft reflects that \nsame understanding.  Eight Justices in Ashcroft applied \nstrict scrutiny: the five Justices in the majority and \nthree of the dissenters, who would have upheld COPA \nunder strict scrutiny.  542 U.S. at 670; see id. at 677 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and \n\n29 \n \n \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Only Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent would have \nsubjected COPA to less than strict scrutiny, contending \nthat the covered speech was unprotected and thus \npresumably subject to rational-basis review.  Id. at 676.  \nThat Justice Scalia advocated that position while eight \nJustices concluded otherwise refutes the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \naccount of a \u201cstartling omission[].\u201d  Pet. App. 17a. \nFurthermore, it is implausible that this Court would \nhave felt itself constrained to apply the wrong tier of \nconstitutional scrutiny simply because the parties \npurportedly invoked the wrong legal standard.  Parties \ncannot \u201cstipulate or bind [a court] to the application of \nan incorrect legal standard.\u201d  NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at \n2429 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (citations \nomitted). At a minimum, it is highly unlikely that the \nCourt would have adopted such a position in a major \nconstitutional case without explaining that it was doing \nso only because of the parties\u2019 arguments\u2014especially \nwhen the precise issue was squarely raised by the \ndissent.  Cf. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279-80 \n(2023) (explaining that the Court was deferring to the \nparties\u2019 presentation of the arguments); McCullen v. \nCoakley, 573 U.S. 464, 478 (2014) (stating that the Court \nwould \u201cassume, without deciding, that\u201d a particular \n\u201clevel of scrutiny\u201d applied). \nb.  In addition to misreading Ashcroft, the Fifth \nCircuit also misread Ginsberg.  The panel majority \ndrastically reduced the applicable standard from strict \nscrutiny to rational-basis review on the theory that such \na result was necessary to afford continuing vitality to \nGinsberg.  See Pet. App. 19a-20a.  But no such straining \nis necessary to give meaning to Ginsberg.   \nProperly understood, Ginsberg stands for the \nimportant but limited proposition that states can define \n\n30 \n \n \nobscenity more broadly for minors than for adults, and \nthus can restrict minors\u2019 access to a broader range of \nsexual content than they can permissibly restrict for \nadults.  390 U.S. at 638; see Brown, 564 U.S. at 793-94 \n(describing Ginsberg in those terms); Pet. App. 55a, 68a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting) (same).  That holding \nreflects the government\u2019s \u201csomewhat broader authority \nto regulate the activities of children,\u201d Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74-75 (1976) \n(citing Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 629), but it does not affect \nthe state\u2019s authority to regulate access by adults to \ncontent that is constitutionally protected for them. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary reading does not find \nadequate roots in Ginsberg.  As explained above, \nGinsberg did not involve a law that burdened the speech \nrights of adults while restricting access for minors.  See \npp. 20-21, supra.  The law barred only \u201cknowing[]\u201d sales \nto minors and did not prescribe age verification in any \nform, let alone across all transactions, or otherwise \nrestrict adults\u2019 access.  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 633-34.  So \nlong as a vendor did not sell to someone appearing to be \na minor, the law had nothing to say.  See id. at 643-44.  \nThat is why the vendor in Ginsberg appealed his \nconviction by invoking the rights of minors, not adults.  \nSee id. at 636 (\u201c[H]is contention is \u2026 that the scope of \nthe constitutional freedom of expression secured to a \ncitizen to read or see material concerned with sex \ncannot be made to depend upon whether the citizen is \nan adult or a minor.\u201d); see Appellant Br., Ginsberg, \nsupra (No. 47, O.T. 1967), 1967 WL 113634, at *7 (\u201cThe \nappellant\u2019s position is that the restriction on the \ndistribution of literature based on age classification is \ncensorship, pure and simple.\u201d).  The Court rejected the \nargument on those terms, holding that \u201cthe concept of \nobscenity \u2026 may vary according to the group to whom \n\n31 \n \n \nthe questionable material is directed or from whom it is \nquarantined.\u201d  390 U.S. at 636 (citation omitted).  To be \nsure, if the challenge in this case rested on the \nproposition that minors have rights to view sexual \ncontent covered by H.B. 1181, Ginsberg might be \nrelevant.  Recognizing Ginsberg\u2019s continued vitality in \nsuch a circumstance gives that precedent the force it is \ndue, no more and no less.   \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nposition, \nby \ncontrast, \ncontravenes the decades of precedents after Ginsberg \nthat applied strict scrutiny to laws restricting the \nspeech rights of adults alongside minors.  See pp. 20-24, \nsupra.  Indeed, no other court in the 20 years since \nAshcroft or the 56 years since Ginsberg has even \nsuggested anything like the position adopted by the \nFifth Circuit here.  And the only case addressing such a \nlaw after the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision relies on Ashcroft \nand Judge Higginbotham\u2019s dissent rather than the \nFifth Circuit majority opinion.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. \nv. Rokita,      F. Supp. 3d     , 2024 WL 3228197, at *7-16 \n(S.D. Ind. June 28, 2024).  Reviewing a nearly identical \nage-verification provision, the district court in that case \nheld that the \u201ccase is not close\u201d and that the law is a \n\u201cdead ringer\u201d for the statute addressed by this Court in \nAshcroft.  Id. at *18.  The court rejected the state\u2019s \nattempts to evade strict scrutiny, which the court held \nis dictated by \u201ceach of\u201d this Court\u2019s cases addressing \nstatutes that burden adults in the course of \u201cseeking to \nprotect \nminors \nfrom \nindecent \nwire \ncommunications.\u201d  Id. at *13.5   \n \n5   On appeal, the Seventh Circuit stayed the resulting \npreliminary injunction without \u201cconsidering the standards \nappropriate to a stay pending appeal on the merits,\u201d on the theory \n \n\n32 \n \n \nc.  The Fifth Circuit briefly suggested that strict \nscrutiny does not apply for the additional reason that \nH.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification requirement constitutes \nonly a speech burden rather than a speech ban.  Pet. \nApp. 16a n.23.  But this Court has never required that a \ncontent-based law actually ban speech to trigger strict \nscrutiny.  To the contrary, the Court has confirmed \nmany times\u2014including in the context of laws restricting \nadults\u2019 access to constitutionally protected sexual \nexpression\u2014that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s content-based \nburdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its \ncontent-based bans.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 812 \n(emphases added); see, e.g., Reed, 576 U.S. at 171-72 \n(applying strict scrutiny not to a ban on speech but to a \nregulation governing the size of political signs); Simon \n& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime \nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991) (\u201cA statute is \npresumptively inconsistent with the First Amendment \nif it imposes a financial burden on speakers because of \nthe content of their speech.\u201d); cf. Sorrell v. IMS Health \nInc., 564 U.S. 552, 565-66 (2011) (\u201cLawmakers may no \nmore silence unwanted speech by burdening its \nutterance than by censoring its content.\u201d). \nd.  Finally, the Fifth Circuit suggested it was \nimpelled towards applying rational-basis review for \nfear that states otherwise would lack means of \nprotecting children from harmful sexual content.  Pet. \nApp. 22a-23a.  But in applying strict scrutiny in Sable, \nPlayboy, Reno, and Ashcroft, the Court noted less \n \nsimply that the Indiana and Texas statutes should be treated the \nsame (i.e., not subject to an injunction) pending the Court\u2019s \ndecision in this case.  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Rokita, 2024 WL \n3861733, at *1-2 (7th Cir. Aug. 16, 2024) (Rovner, J., concurring in \npart, dissenting in part). \n\n33 \n \n \nrestrictive options each time.  Strict scrutiny is not \u201ca \ndeath knell in and of itself.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  The Court \nhas upheld laws under strict First Amendment scrutiny.  \nSee, e.g., Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 444, \n457 (2015); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 39 (2010); cf. Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 366-67, 371-72 (2010) (upholding disclaimer and \ndisclosure provisions of campaign-finance law because \nthey survived \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d).  The Court in \nAshcroft expressly stated that a narrowly tailored \n\u201cregulation of the Internet designed to prevent minors \nfrom gaining access to harmful materials\u201d would pass \nmuster, and pointed to less restrictive options.  542 U.S. \nat 666-70, 672.  And the district court in this case \nlikewise acknowledged that there \u201care viable and \nconstitutional means to achieve Texas\u2019s goal\u201d of \nprotecting minors from sexual content online without \nunduly limiting adults\u2019 rights.  Pet. App. 160a.  Adhering \nto strict scrutiny, in sum, would not render states \npowerless to protect minors.  It would merely require \nthem to do so through a carefully tailored law. \nAccepting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position, by contrast, \ncould invite even more troubling restrictions on speech, \nreaching beyond petitioners\u2019 websites to include \n\u201cbookstores, \nlibraries, \npublishers, \nauthors \nand[] \nmainstream websites,\u201d among others.  Am. Booksellers \nCert. Amicus Br. 1.  After all, if a state seeking to \nprotect minors from harmful sexual content needs only \na rational basis to restrict adults\u2019 access to protected \nspeech, states might attempt to ban the publication of \nsexual content more generally\u2014a seemingly rational \nmechanism to shield minors from sexual content that \ncould harm them.  But see Butler, 352 U.S. at 383-84.  \nNor would the implications of affirmance necessarily be \nlimited to sexual content in the eyes of lower courts.  \n\n34 \n \n \nSeveral states have recently enacted laws requiring \nsocial-media websites to perform age verification \nbefore allowing access to their platforms.  See, e.g., Ark. \nCode \u00a7 4-88-1402; Ga. Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-6-2, 3 (effective July \n1, 2025).  Other states have pursued content-based \nrestrictions on library books or instructional materials \nunder the auspices of protecting minors from \npurportedly harmful speech more broadly.  See, e.g., \nIowa Code \u00a7 256.11; Tenn. Code \u00a7 49-6-1019.  Even if \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning would not apply directly to \nsuch laws, any suggestion that they could be subject to \nmere rational-basis review would lead down a troubling \nroad.  Cf. Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 503 (2011) \n(\u201cSlight encroachments create new boundaries from \nwhich legions of power can seek new territory to \ncapture.\u201d (citation omitted)). \n4. H.B. 1181\u2019s Age-Verification Provision Is \nAlso Subject To Strict Scrutiny Because It \nEmbodies Speaker-Based Discrimination \nH.B. 1181 is subject to struct scrutiny on a separate \nground: it discriminates against particular speakers in \nways that suggest the state\u2019s disapproval of the content \nof their speech.    \na.  \u201cLaws designed or intended to suppress or \nrestrict the expression of specific speakers contradict \nbasic First Amendment principles.\u201d  Playboy, 529 U.S. \nat 812.  Such \u201c[s]peaker-based laws run the risk that \n\u2018the State has left unburdened those speakers whose \nmessages are in accord with its own views.\u2019\u201d  NIFLA, \n585 U.S. at 778 (citation omitted).  Unless the \nchallenged law can survive strict scrutiny, the First \nAmendment \u201cdoes not permit [the government] to \nimpose special prohibitions on those speakers who \n\n35 \n \n \nexpress views on disfavored subjects.\u201d  R.A.V. v. St. \nPaul, 505 U.S. 377, 391 (1992). \nH.B. 1181 squarely implicates those concerns.  It \ndiscriminates based on speaker by targeting the online \npornography industry while leaving unregulated \nidentical sexual content on social-media websites, on \nsearch engines, and on websites that limit their sexual \ncontent to no more than one-third of their total content, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 129B.002, 005.  In \nsubstance, the legislature has singled out the \npornography industry while allowing those outside the \nindustry to purvey the same content without any such \nrestrictions.  See Rokita, 2024 WL 3228197, at *16 \n(explaining that materially identical Indiana law \n\u201cdiscriminates amongst speakers in the marketplace\u201d). \nFar from disguising its true design, Texas \npractically trumpets its censorial intent.  See Br. in Opp. \n1, 4 (boasting of success in limiting the speech of \u201cthe \npornography industry\u201d and describing petitioners\u2019 \nprotected speech as \u201cinexhaustible amounts of [] smut\u201d); \nResp. C.A. Br. 1, 23 (describing H.B. 1181\u2019s target as \n\u201ccommercial purveyors of online pornography\u201d and \ncastigating petitioners as \u201cBig Porn\u201d).  The law\u2019s \nimposition of compelled \u201chealth warnings\u201d make this \nconclusion inescapable, branding, as they do, all \npetitioners\u2019 adult patrons as unwell and needing \npsychiatric treatment.  See  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \n\u00a7 129B.004 (capitalization altered); p. 8, supra. \nb.  In concluding otherwise, the panel majority \nstated that H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions of search engines \nand social media were driven by \u201ca reasonable policy \nchoice \nto \navoid \nthe \nlegal \nconcerns \nthat \naccompany \u2026 regulat[ing] the \u2018entire universe of \ncyberspace.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n\n36 \n \n \n868).  But Texas has shown no compunction about \nregulating the entities that it left out of this law.  See \nNetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at 2408.  More fundamentally, \nexempting social-media websites and search engines \ncannot explain speaker-based discrimination where, as \nhere, it defeats the law\u2019s avowed purpose.  As the \ndistrict court found, H.B. 1181\u2019s exemptions allow \nminors to access, without any restrictions, endless \nvolumes of the same kinds of content that appear on \npetitioners\u2019 sites.  Pet. App. 113a-114a.  Indeed, \n\u201c[Texas\u2019s] own expert suggests that exposure to online \npornography often begins with \u2018misspelled searches,\u2019\u201d \nPet. App. 112a, and \u201c[Texas\u2019s] own study \u2026 points \nout[ that] pop-up ads, not pornographic websites, are \nthe most common forms of sexual material encountered \nby adolescents,\u201d  Pet. App. 131a.  Such \u201cdifferential \ntreatment, \nunless \njustified \nby \nsome \nspecial \ncharacteristic of the\u201d online pornography industry\u2014\nwhich the state has not identified\u2014\u201csuggests that the \ngoal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of \nexpression.\u201d  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minn. \nComm\u2019r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 585 (1983). \nThe Fifth Circuit also misread R.A.V., reasoning \nthat the speaker-based \u201c[s]electivity\u201d prohibited by \nthat decision applied to \u201cdifferent sorts of messages, not \ndifferent mediums.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a (citation omitted).  \nBut R.A.V. never cabined its holding in that way, nor did \nit suggest that different rules would govern a speaker-\nbased restriction on another medium.  See 505 U.S. at \n394.  Indeed, this Court has held that an \u201cink and paper \ntax\u201d that \u201csingles out the press\u201d cannot stand for that \nvery reason.  Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 591-92; see \nSmith v. Daily Mail Publ\u2019g Co., 443 U.S. 97, 105-06 \n(1979) (invalidating state law that restricted speech in \nnewspapers but not on radio).  In any event, the search \n\n37 \n \n \nengines and social-media platforms that H.B. 1181 \nexempts are part of the same medium\u2014the Internet\u2014\nas the websites H.B. 1181 targets.  Such a divergent \napproach to regulating the same medium further \nevinces \nspeaker-based \ndiscrimination, \nwhich \nindependently warrants strict scrutiny. \nB. Petitioners Are Likely To Succeed On The \nMerits Of Their Challenge To The Age-\nVerification Requirement In H.B. 1181 \nWhen H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision is \nproperly subjected to strict scrutiny, petitioners satisfy \nthe principal requirement for a preliminary injunction \nbecause  \u201cthey are likely to succeed on the merits.\u201d  \nAshcroft, 542 U.S. at 666.   \n1. To survive strict scrutiny, H.B. 1181 must be \n\u201cnarrowly \ntailored \nto \npromote \na \ncompelling \n[g]overnment interest\u201d and employ the least speech-\nrestrictive means of protecting minors.  Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813; see Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 665-66.  As the \ndistrict court\u2019s undisturbed factual findings make clear, \nTexas cannot come close to satisfying that test.  \nParticularly given this Court\u2019s instruction to \u201cuphold \nthe injunction\u201d if \u201cthe underlying constitutional \nquestion is close,\u201d id. at 664, Texas has no viable path to \nmeeting its heavy burden at this preliminary stage.  \nIndeed, this is if anything an a fortiori case from \nAshcroft, because H.B. 1181 materially replicates \nCOPA while applying to an even wider swath of speech, \nincluding fewer privacy and security protections, and \nexempting channels through which minors can continue \nto access the same sexual content.   \na.  To start, H.B. 1181 is \u201cvastly overinclusive\u201d by \ndesign, restricting through its very structure far more \n\n38 \n \n \nspeech than necessary to accomplish its purported aim.  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 804.  Because the Act\u2019s requirements \napply to an entire website when any more than one-\nthird of the website\u2019s content falls within the statutory \ndefinition of sexual material harmful to minors, the Act \nburdens substantial amounts of speech that do not \nrelate to its stated purpose.  For example, a website that \ncontains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually \nsuggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. \n1181\u2019s restrictions.  That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.  \nAs the district court aptly described, H.B. 1181 is akin \nto a restriction on movie theaters requiring them to \n\u201ccatalog all movies that they show, and if at least one-\nthird of those movies are R-rated, \u2026 screen everyone \nat the main entrance for their 18+ identification, \nregardless of what movie they wanted to see.\u201d  Pet. App. \n111a n.5.   \nb.  At the same time, H.B. 1181 is \u201cwildly \nunderinclusive when judged against its asserted \njustification,\u201d which \u201cis alone enough to defeat it.\u201d  \nBrown, 564 U.S. at 802.  Search engines are explicitly \nexempted from the Act\u2019s age-verification requirement, \neven though a minor can conduct an image or video \nsearch to yield \u201csexually explicit or pornographic\u201d \nresults \u201cextracted from [adult] websites regardless of \nage verification.\u201d  Pet. App. 112a.  Likewise, social-\nmedia \nplatforms \nlike \nReddit \n\u201cmaintain \nentire \ncommunities and forums\u201d devoted \u201cto posting online \npornography.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  Instagram and \nFacebook similarly contain \u201cmaterial which is sexually \nexplicit for minors.\u201d  Pet. App. 113a.  And a website \ncontaining massive amounts of sexual material obscene \nas to minors can remain unregulated just by adding \ntwice as much non-sexual material.  All of these \nloopholes allow minors to access the very material \n\n39 \n \n \nTexas purportedly wants to protect them from\u2014indeed, \nthe \u201cmaterial most likely to serve as a gateway to \npornography use.\u201d  Pet. App. 114a.  \nSuch significant gaps are \u201cnot how one addresses a \nserious social problem,\u201d and they render H.B. 1181 no \nless underinclusive than other laws that this Court has \ninvalidated under the First Amendment.  Brown, 564 \nU.S. at 802; see, e.g., id. at 805 (striking down a statute \nbarring the sale of violent video games to minors \nbecause it excluded other portrayals of similar violence); \nDenver Area, 518 U.S. at 753, 757, 760 (striking down a \nban on sexual content \u201con leased channels\u201d but \u201cnot on \nother channels\u201d because such content was \u201cbroadcast \nover both kinds of channels\u201d and \u201cthe record before \nCongress \u2026 provides no convincing explanation\u201d for \ndifferential treatment); Daily Mail, 443 U.S. at 104-05 \n(striking \ndown \nlaw \nthat \nprohibited \nnewspaper \npublication \nof \nyouthful \noffenders\u2019 \nnames \nwhile \npermitting publication by \u201celectronic media\u201d).  \nc.  Finally, like the federal government in Ashcroft \nand Reno, Texas fails to show that H.B. 1181 employs \nthe least restrictive means of pursuing its compelling \nend.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 666 (citing Reno, 521 U.S. at \n874).  The district court\u2019s factual findings make clear \nthat less restrictive and more effective alternatives are \nreadily available, chief among them the modern variant \nof the content-filtering software that this Court \nrecognized as a less restrictive alternative to the age-\nverification regime in Ashcroft.  Id. at 666-73; see Pet. \nApp. 133a-135a.  Content-filtering software is installed \n\u201cat the receiving end\u201d\u2014e.g., on individual devices such \nas laptops or smart phones\u2014and prevents those devices \nfrom displaying material from selected websites or \napplications.  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 667; see Pet. App. \n\n40 \n \n \n132a, 134a; J.A. 59.  Such software is commonly used by \nemployers and other institutions (likely including \nfederal courts) to limit access to websites deemed \ninappropriate.  See J.A. 280. \nAs explained in Ashcroft, content-filtering software \nis less restrictive of speech than \u201cuniversal restrictions \nat the source\u201d such as mandatory age-verification \nbecause it can restrict minors\u2019 access to inappropriate \ncontent while preserving adults\u2019 \u201caccess to speech they \nhave a right to see without having to identify \nthemselves or provide\u201d sensitive personal information.  \n542 U.S. at 667.  Likewise, content-filtering software \nempowers parents to control the kinds of material their \nchildren are able to view, which by definition provides \nbetter tailoring than a blunt governmental mandate.  Id. \nat 667-68; cf. Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. \n180, 201-02 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[P]arents, not \nthe State, have the primary authority and duty to raise, \neducate, and form the character of their children.\u201d); \nPlayboy, 529 U.S. at 824-25 (emphasizing the goal of \nproviding options for parents in restricting minors\u2019 \naccess to sexual content).  And content-filtering \nsoftware is more effective than age verification, which \nis notoriously \u201csubject to evasion and circumvention\u201d\u2014\nand which can drive minors to dangerous parts of the \ndark web that content filters would block.  Ashcroft, 542 \nU.S. at 667-68; see Int\u2019l Centre for Missing and \nExploited Children (ICMEC) Cert. Amicus Br. 3, 14-16.   \nAs the district court found, all those reasons to \nprefer filtering software ring even truer today.  While \n\u201c[t]he risks of compelled digital verification are just as \nlarge, if not greater\u201d than in 2004, filtering software has \nonly improved and \u201ccan more precisely screen out \nsexual content for minors without limiting access to \n\n41 \n \n \nother speech.\u201d  Pet. App. 127a, 132a.  Moreover, minors \nhave only grown savvier with technology, such as \nVirtual Private Networks (VPNs), that bypass online \nage verification with ease.  Pet. App. 134a; see ICMEC \nCert. Amicus Br. 10-13.  Yet despite this Court\u2019s \ninstruction in Ashcroft that governments \u201cundoubtedly \nmay act to encourage the use of filters\u201d or \u201ctake steps \nto promote their development by industry,\u201d 542 U.S. at \n669, Texas has taken no such steps\u2014or even, as far as \nthe legislative record reflects, considered such less \nrestrictive \nalternatives, \nsee \nPet. \nApp. \n85a \n(Higginbotham, J., dissenting); Pet. App. 135a-136a.6 \n2.  Texas has suggested that, even if H.B. 1181 fails \nstrict scrutiny, it is nevertheless immune from facial \ninvalidation because it permissibly applies to obscene \nspeech that is constitutionally unprotected for adults.  \nBr. in Opp. 22; see NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. at 2397 \n(explaining that a First Amendment facial challenge \nrequires showing that \u201ca substantial number of [the \nlaw\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d \n(citation omitted)).  But as explained above\u2014and as the \nstate conceded in the Fifth Circuit\u2014Texas separately \ncriminalizes obscenity for adults, so the whole point of \n \n6  It would also be less restrictive to pair preinstalled filtering \ntechnology on devices with device-level age-verification measures, \nmeaning that the device would block sexually explicit content by \ndefault until an adult user verifies his or her age on the device.  \nPet. App. 128a; see ICMEC Cert. Amicus Br. 17-19.  Alternatively, \nInternet service providers could by default block sexually explicit \ncontent until adults opt out of the blocking regime.  Pet. App. 128a; \ncf. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 823 (noting that a \u201cwell-promoted \nvoluntary blocking provision\u201d could be a less restrictive means of \npreventing minors\u2019 access to sexual content); Denver Area, 518 \nU.S. at 759 (similar). \n\n42 \n \n \nH.B. 1181 is to impose age verification and other \nburdens on sexual material that is obscene for minors \nbut not for adults.  See pp. 25-26, supra.  H.B. 1181 is \nthus no more immune to a facial challenge than the \nsimilarly structured laws in Reno and Ashcroft, both of \nwhich were challenged facially and subject to \npreliminary injunctions that this Court affirmed.  See \nReno, 521 U.S. at 883, 885; Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664, \n672. \nNor is H.B. 1181 susceptible to the analysis that led \nthe Court in NetChoice to question the facial challenges \nat issue.  There, the Court remanded for the lower \ncourts to \u201cask[], as to every covered platform or \nfunction, whether there is an intrusion on protected \neditorial discretion.\u201d  144 S. Ct. at 2398.  The Court \nadded that \u201cit is not hard to see how the answers might \ndiffer\u201d depending on the nature of the platform.  Id.  No \nsuch reasoning applies here, because there are no \ndistinctions among covered websites that entitle some \nto greater constitutional protection than others.  \u201cIt is \nthe structure of the law, and not its application to any \nparticular [website], that renders it unconstitutional.\u201d  \nPet. App. 122a n.10; see Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. \nBonta, 594 U.S. 595, 618 (2021) (similarly finding that a \nlaw that exhibits categorically improper tailoring is \nfacially invalid under the First Amendment).  If \nanything, Texas\u2019s defense of H.B. 1181 focuses on its \napplication to these challengers, which comprise the \ntargeted industry; upon advancing to other applications, \nTexas\u2019s defense becomes that much weaker and the \nlikely unconstitutionality that much clearer.  In other \nwords, the basis for facial unconstitutionality follows a \nfortiori from the success of an as-applied challenge here.  \nSee Order Den. Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal at 4-13, \nFree Speech Coal. v. Rokita, No. 1:24-cv-00980-RLY-\n\n43 \n \n \nMG (S.D. Ind. July 25, 2024), ECF No. 50 (rejecting a \nsimilar NetChoice-based facial challenge argument).   \nC. Petitioners \nSatisfy \nThe \nRemaining \nPreliminary Injunction Factors \nBeyond likelihood of success on the merits, \npetitioners satisfy the other requirements for a \npreliminary injunction.  They are \u201clikely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief \u201d \nand \u201cthe balance of equities\u201d and \u201cthe public interest\u201d \nweigh heavily in their favor.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n\u201cThe loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes \nirreparable injury.\u201d  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976).  With Texas actively filing enforcement actions \nunder H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provision, the chill \ninflicted on petitioners\u2019 protected speech is ongoing and \npalpable\u2014thus supplying a paradigmatic basis for a \npreliminary injunction. \nPetitioners also face the additional irreparable harm \nof bearing the unrecoverable costs of complying with an \nunconstitutional law.  Indeed, \u201ccomplying with a \nregulation later held invalid almost always produces \nthe irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance \ncosts.\u201d  Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, \n220-21 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Given Texas\u2019s \nsovereign immunity from claims for money damages, \nsee Pet. App. 157a, petitioners face mounting financial \nburdens of complying with the law (either by \nimplementing costly measures or by abandoning \noperations) if the preliminary injunction is not restored. \nAs for the equities, they merge with the public \ninterest, see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nand strongly favor petitioners.  States have no interest \n\n44 \n \n \nin enforcing unconstitutional laws, particularly laws \nthat are as ineffective and ill-suited to their avowed \npurpose as H.B. 1181 is.  See Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d \n638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\u201c[E]nforcement of an \nunconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest.\u201d).  \nFinally, as in Ashcroft, restoring the preliminary \ninjunction will not end this case.  See 542 U.S. at 672-73. \nTo the extent a factual dispute remains as to H.B. 1181\u2019s \ntailoring and the least restrictive means, both sides may \nbenefit from a more fulsome factual record.  See Pet. \nApp. 85a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  In this respect, \ntoo, proper resolution of this case follows from Reno and \nAshcroft, which affirmed preliminary injunctions of like \nlaws while \u201callow[ing] the parties to update and \nsupplement the factual record to reflect current \ntechnological realities.\u201d  Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 672. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.   \n \n \n\n45 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nDAVID D.

This is the dispositive legal question.\n*   **Information Sources Identified:** The primary sources for the competing legal arguments have been identified. The petitioner's brief will contain the arguments for applying strict scrutiny, while the respondent's brief will advocate for rational basis review. The potential influence of amicus briefs, particularly from the Solicitor General, is also noted as a key signal to monitor.\n*   **Substantive Knowledge Unchanged:** I have not yet learned any specific legal arguments, precedents, or facts from the case briefs. My substantive knowledge about the case remains at its initial state. However, I now have a clear framework for acquiring and evaluating the necessary information.

The resulting observation will cause a massive update to my posterior beliefs, making the Task EIG maximal.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175. Unsurprisingly, \u201c[t]he pornography industry \nremains a bastion of explicit anti-black stereotyping\u2014\nraw, obscene, and increasing mainstreamed.\u201d David Pil-\ngrim, The Jezebel Stereotype (updated 2024), Jim Crow \nMuseum, https://perma.cc/2VT8-LVFU.  \n3. The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD. Be-\nfore being forced to remove millions of its videos when \n\u201ccredit [card] companies \u2026 cut ties with\u201d it for hosting \n\u201cinappropriate and illegal videos,\u201d Paul, supra, Pornhub \nbragged that if you \u201cstarted watching 2019\u2019s new videos \nin 1850, you would still be watching them today.\u201d J.A.177. \nFurthermore, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing \nthe industry. See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637. It may \u201cnega-\ntively influence attitudes towards women,\u201d \u201ccause de-\npression, anxiety, decreases in well-being, reduced self-\nesteem,\u201d and cause \u201crisker sexual behaviors (such as \ncondom non-use), a likelihood to experience unhealthy \n\n8 \n \ndating relationships, [and] a tendency to perpetrate \nand/or experience sexual violence.\u201d ROA.1637-39. \nC. Children\u2019s exposure to online pornography \nChildhood exposure to obscenity has increased as \nonline pornography\u2019s reach and sophistication has \ngrown.

Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 634-35 \n(1968). Nevertheless, Petitioners insist that because they \nhave moved their business online, the First Amendment \nprotects their right to distribute a nearly inexhaustible \namount of obscenity to any child with a smartphone. \nFor nearly thirty years, due to technological limita-\ntions, governments have struggled to translate Ginsberg \nfrom bookstores to the internet. See Ashcroft v. ACLU \n(Ashcroft II), 542 U.S. 656 (2004); Reno v. ACLU, 521 \nU.S. 844 (1997). Technology, however, has evolved: \nAround the world, websites can and do create adult-only \nzones where adults can view materials unsuited for chil-\ndren. The question presented here is thus: \n \nGiven that a State may, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, restrict minors\u2019 access to pornographic materials, \nwhether it is facially unconstitutional for a State to re-\nquire a commercial entity that provides such materials to \ntake commercially reasonable steps to verify the age of \nits customers. \n \n\n \n(II) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage \nQuestion Presented ...........................................................

Like \n\u201cdoomscrolling\u201d on social media, online pornographers \nuse sophisticated algorithms to keep adults who have \ngreater maturity than children on their sites. Childhood \naccess to this avalanche of misogynistic and often violent \nsmut \u201c\u2018is creating a public health crisis.\u2019\u201d Marc Novicoff, \nA Simple Law is Doing the Impossible. It\u2019s Making the \nOnline Porn Industry Retreat, Politico (Aug. 8, 2023) \n(quoting Louisiana age-verification bill), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/Novicoff2023.  \nIn 2023, the Texas Legislature\u2014voting 164 to 1\u2014ad-\ndressed this crisis by enacting House Bill 1181 (\u201cH.B. \n1181\u201d). H.B. 1181 does not prevent adults from viewing \npornography. Instead, it requires online pornographers \nto take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that \ntheir customers are not children. Nor is H.B. 1181 an out-\nlier. Countries all around the world require online por-\nnographers to use age-verification technology.     \n \nPetitioners say little about what they sell. But even \nthey admit (at 3) that Texas has a compelling interest in \npreventing children from viewing the content on their \nwebsites. This Court has held\u2014\u201ccategorically\u201d\u2014that \n\u201cobscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-\nment,\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 23 (1973), and \nhas emphasized that States may prevent \u201cthe sale to mi-\nnors of sexual material that would be obscene from the \nperspective of a child \u2026 so long as the legislature\u2019s judg-\nment that the proscribed materials [are] harmful to chil-\ndren \u2018[is] not irrational.\u2019\u201d Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass\u2019n, \n564 U.S. 786, 793-94 (2011) (quoting Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \n\n2 \n \nat 641). States thus can require brick-and-mortar retail-\ners peddling obscenity to verify the ages of their custom-\ners. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 634-35. Indeed, all \u201c50 States\u201d \nbar minors from buying \u201cpornographic materials.\u201d \nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 824 (1988). \n \nBecause no one disputes that Texas can prevent kids \nfrom accessing hardcore pornography, this case is about \nmeans, not ends. Petitioners would prefer that the pro-\ntection of children be left to device manufacturers. But \nwhere, as here, the level of constitutional protection de-\npends on the identity of the listener, a State can require \nthe speaker to serve as a gatekeeper. See Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 125-26 \n(1989). That principle of law has not changed just be-\ncause obscenity has moved online. \n \nEven if Ginsberg were inapplicable in cyberspace, \nhowever, H.B. 1181 would still easily survive. Texas \nseeks to protect kids from some of the most prurient sex-\nual content imaginable. And the means Texas has chosen \nis appropriate. Texas has addressed only websites dedi-\ncated to pornography, has allowed them to comply by us-\ning common age-verification technology, and has not im-\nposed criminal penalties. Such a modest but important \nlaw satisfies any level of scrutiny.   \n \nThat point is especially true, moreover, in the posture \nof a facial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 decision to facially challenge H.B. 1181 \u201ccomes \nat a cost.\u201d Moody v. NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. 2383, 2397 \n(2024). They must show that \u201ca substantial number of \n[the law\u2019s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in \nrelation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d Id. \nThey cannot because much of the content on their web-\nsites is obscene even for adults. No one has a constitu-\ntional right to view \u201cteen bondage gangbang\u201d videos, \n\n3 \n \nmuch less hundreds of thousands of them. J.A.176. And \nbecause this case concerns the extraordinary remedy of \na preliminary injunction, Petitioners must show more \nthan just a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits. Yet they have not identified a single person who has \nbeen chilled. By any measure, the Fifth Circuit correctly \nvacated the district court\u2019s flawed injunction. \n \nSTATEMENT \nI. Children and Online Pornography \nA. The online pornography industry \n1. Petitioners say almost nothing about what\u2019s on \ntheir websites. Suffice it to say, they are not streaming \n\u201cromance novels or R-rated movies.\u201d Contra Pet.Br.1. \nPetitioners include (1) an association of pornographic ac-\ntors, producers, distributors, and retailers; (2) foreign \nand domestic producers, sellers, and licensers of pornog-\nraphy; and (3) Jane Doe, a pornographic performer. \nROA.19-24.1 Petitioner MG Freesites Ltd. operates \nPornhub\u2014\u201cthe 12th most visited website in the world \u2026 \nahead of Amazon, TikTok, and LinkedIn.\u201d Bradley \nSaacks, Inside Pornhub\u2019s Finances, Semafor (Jul. 27, \n2023), https://perma.cc/EC8Q-3FEU; ROA.21. \n \nOnline pornographers are sophisticated. Like social-\nmedia companies, they use complex algorithms to hook \nusers. See, e.g., Amy Adler, Arousal by Algorithm, 109 \nCornell L. Rev. 787, 811 (2024). Their content triggers \nneurological effects akin to gambling. See Todd Love et \nal., Neuroscience of Internet Pornography Addiction: A \nReview and Update, 5(3) Behavioral Sciences 388 (2015); \nsee also J.A.254 (H.B. 1181 bill analysis noting that por-\nnography is biologically addictive). \n \n1 \u201cROA\u201d refers to the record on appeal. \n\n4 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 business models generally fall into two \ncategories: \nadvertisement-based \nand \nsubscription-\nbased. The first generates revenue from \u201cadvertising \nplacements on its website and through referral fees.\u201d \nROA.249. The second generates revenue from subscrip-\ntions\u2014often paid for with personal credit cards, com-\nplete with identifying information. ROA.250-51.  \n2. As online pornographers have become more so-\nphisticated, the type of content they display has also \nchanged. Now, websites use their \u201cextraordinary trove \nof user data to script pornography (often using A/B test-\ning), giving data-driven specific requirements to porn \nproducers to fulfill.\u201d Adler, supra, at 813. This creates \nwhat one scholar has identified as an \u201cA.I.-driven feed-\nback loop\u201d in which pornography \u201cgains the capacity to \ncrystalize, amplify, and distort desire itself.\u201d Id. \n \n\u201cMost of today\u2019s pornography,\u201d moreover, \u201cdoes not \nreflect consensual, loving, healthy relationships\u201d but \n\u201cteaches dominance, aggression, disrespect, and objecti-\nfication.\u201d Byrin Romney, Screens, Teens, and Porn \nScenes: Legislative Approaches to Protecting Youth \nfrom Exposure to Pornography, 45 Vt. L. Rev. 43, 43 \n(2020) (emphasis omitted). For example, and Texas re-\ncites the following with considerable reluctance, in one of \nPetitioner Xnxx\u2019s more than 300,000 free videos of \u201cteen \nbondage gangbang[s],\u201d five men tie a young woman down \nwith electrical tape and take turns penetrating her \norally, vaginally, and anally\u2014sometimes simultaneously. \nJ.A.176. In this 36-minute video\u2014viewed more than \n650,000 times as of August 2023\u2014the men choke the \nwoman and eventually strap an open-mouth gag or \n\u201cmouth spreader\u201d over her head, forcing her mouth open \nwhile they ejaculate in it. J.A.176.  \nThis video is far from unique. Gagging, slapping, hair \n\n5 \n \npulling, spanking, and increasingly choking are the five \nmost common forms of physical aggression found in por-\nnography, and women are the targets of such violence \n97% of the time. J.A.158. In 2020, Pornhub removed \u201cmil-\nlions of videos\u2014the majority of its content\u2014after an in-\nvestigation revealed a large number of them featured un-\nderaged and sex-trafficked subjects.\u201d Kari Paul, Porn-\nhub Removes Millions of Videos After Investigation \nFinds Child Abuse Content, The Guardian (Dec. 14, \n2020), https://perma.cc/MXU8-6KFC. Even so, one of \nPetitioner\u2019s sites recently listed 306,230 videos of \u201cper-\nfect girl porn,\u201d 579,497 videos of \u201cteen hardcore\u201d porn, \nand 328,273 videos of \u201cyoung petite porn.\u201d ROA.399. \nAnother popular category is hentai, a cartoon intro-\nduction to violent pornography which commonly features \n\u201ca grotesque creature penetrating a girl with an enor-\nmous phallus or tentacle\u201d\u2014acts which, if performed in \nreal life, would result in severe injury or death. J.A.159-\n60. Pornhub alone hosts over 100,000 of these videos. \nJ.A.159. And for customers whose tastes in domination \nand humiliation run to particular races, Petitioners have \nthat, too. One site offers 88,713 free videos of \u201cAsian \nbondage\u201d and another 91,203 of \u201cEbony bondage.\u201d \nJ.A.175.

The astounding amount of online obscenity con-\ntinues to grow. Pornhub alone transferred 6,597 \npetabytes of data in 2019. Romney, supra, at 50. That \nrepresents \u201c1.36 million hours (169 years) of new con-\ntent\u201d\u2014more data than the entire internet in 2002, id. and \n90,000 times the Library of Congress, Matt Raymond, \n\n6 \n \nHow \u2018Big\u2019 is the Library of Congress?, Libr. of Cong. \nBlogs (Feb. 11, 2009), https://perma.cc/TQ5B-4NYD.

See, e.g., Leo Herrera, AI and the Future \nof \nSex, \nMIT \nTech. \nRev. \n(Aug. \n26, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/SH8C-Q6PN. \u201cUsers can now check \nboxes on a list of options as long as the Cheesecake Fac-\ntory menu \u2026: categories like male, female, and trans; \nages from 18 to 90; breast and penis size; details like \u2026 \nunderwear color; backdrops like grocery stores, \nchurches, the Eiffel Tower, and Stonehenge; even \nweather.\u201d Id. It is also possible to furtively create por-\nnography involving people in one\u2019s daily life. Id. \nB. The effects of pornography on children \n1. Pornography harms children, a fact Petitioners \nnowhere deny. Repeated exposure may trigger disasso-\nciation, \u201cdepression,\u201d and psychosomatic symptoms such \nas \u201cheadache, irritability, [and] trouble sleeping.\u201d \nJ.A.160, 162. Children who view pornography are more \nlikely to use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and disengage \nfrom school. J.A.161. They have less social integration \nand decreased emotional attachment with caregivers. \nJ.A.160. They also experience \u201cpoor social functioning, \nimpulsiveness, and social anxiety,\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional \nstress responses and poor executive function,\u201d as well as \n\u201cimpairments to judgment, memory, and emotional reg-\nulation.\u201d J.A.162. They may also develop unrealistic ex-\npectations about their appearance. J.A.163.   \nChildren who habitually view pornography are more \n\n7 \n \nlikely to exhibit behavioral problems such as emulating \nsexual strangulation, dating violence, and sexual coer-\ncion. J.A.160-163. In fact, \u201c42% of 15-16-year-olds ex-\npressed the desire to mirror pornography\u2014and more \nthan half of all boys believe that online porn depicts re-\nalistic sexuality.\u201d J.A.161. Adolescent viewers are thus at \nhigher risk of intimate partner cyberstalking and adult \nperpetration of child sexual abuse. J.A.160-61, 164. For \ngirls, early exposure to online pornography is a risk fac-\ntor for later suffering sexual abuse, sexual coercion, and \nsexual aggression. J.A.161. And all children exposed to \npornography are \u201cmore likely to display hypersexualiza-\ntion and to develop paraphilias (e.g., exhibitionism, vo-\nyeurism).\u201d J.A.161. \nThe dramatic rise of \u201cchoking\u201d well illustrates the \ndanger, given that it is \u201cdefined by medical science as \n\u2018nonfatal strangulation\u2019\u201d and \u201cposes grave neurological \nharms to victims, including unconsciousness, brain in-\njury, seizure, motor and speech disorders, memory loss,\u201d \nand PTSD. J.A.158. Not by coincidence, children mirror \nsuch dangerous conduct. See, e.g., Peggy Orenstein, The \nTroubling Trend in Teenage Sex, N.Y. Times (Apr. 12, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/2mp4z4j2 (tying the alarming \nspike of \u201csexual strangulation\u201d of girls \u201cbetween the ages \n[of] 12 and 17\u201d to online pornography, where such behav-\nior has become a \u201cstaple\u201d). \nFar from rebutting this trend, Petitioners\u2019 own evi-\ndence confirms that \u201call signs point to the idea that main-\nstream online pornography appears to negatively influ-\nence youth in several ways.\u201d ROA.1637. It may \u201cnega-\ntively influence attitudes towards women,\u201d \u201ccause de-\npression, anxiety, decreases in well-being, reduced self-\nesteem,\u201d and cause \u201crisker sexual behaviors (such as \ncondom non-use), a likelihood to experience unhealthy \n\n8 \n \ndating relationships, [and] a tendency to perpetrate \nand/or experience sexual violence.\u201d ROA.1637-39. \nC. Children\u2019s exposure to online pornography \nChildhood exposure to obscenity has increased as \nonline pornography\u2019s reach and sophistication has \ngrown. In fact, \u201capproximately one in five youth experi-\nence unwanted online exposure to sexually explicit mate-\nrial.\u201d J.A.241 (bill analysis for H.B. 1181). \nThe last two decades have also seen a dramatic in-\ncrease in the number of children under 13 exposed to \npornography\u2014despite content filtering. In 2006, just \nover 25% of children aged 13 or younger were exposed to \nonline pornography. See Chiara Sabina, et al., The Na-\nture and Dynamics of Internet Pornography Exposure \nfor Youth, 11 CyberPsychology & Behavior 691, 692 \n(2008). By 2022, that number more than doubled to 54%. \nSee Michael B. Robb & Supreet Mann, Common Sense \nMedia, \nTeens \nand \nPornography \nat \n5 \n(2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/YG3L-W3LK. And the number of chil-\ndren exposed to online pornography at age 10 or younger \nincreased more than seven-fold from less than 2% in 2008 \nto 15% by 2022. Id; Sabina, supra at 692.  \n \nIf the picture these statistics paint was not disturbing \nenough, it becomes even darker when the kind of por-\nnography is considered. Over a third of boys exposed to \npornography reported viewing \u201c[s]exual activity involv-\ning bondage\u201d; almost a third, \u201c[s]exual activity between \npeople and animals\u201d; over a fifth, \u201c[s]exual activity in-\nvolving urine or feces\u201d; and almost that many, \u201c[r]ape or \nsexual violence.\u201d Sabina, supra, at 693. And all of that \nwas before the explosion of smartphones. Today, \u201cusing \nsmartphones to access free pornography online is the \nmost common means of viewing pornographic material.\u201d \nAmanda Giordano, What to Know About Adolescent \n\n9 \n \nPornography Exposure, Psychology Today (Feb. 27, \n2022), https://tinyurl.com/GiordanoPsych. \n \nD. Age-verification technology \n1. Age verification is a generic term that refers to a \nset of techniques and technologies to determine some-\none\u2019s likely age. J.A.49. It is used for any number of age-\nrestricted products and services such as online gambling, \nalcohol and tobacco sales, and car rentals. J.A.194, 198. \nSuch technology can determine a person\u2019s age in various \nways, including by government identification, credit \ncards, credit checks, bank records, and even age estima-\ntion through facial, voice, or behavioral analysis. J.A.188-\n91. Age may also be inferred by the existence of some \nother fact\u2014for example, someone who is a commercial \nairline pilot must be over 18. J.A.187, 189.  \nAge verification often does not take place on the web-\nsite that requires it. J.A.185. Instead, a person can obtain \nverification from a third-party provider by downloading \nan age-verification app (such as Yoti) or visiting an age-\nverification provider\u2019s website. J.A.185-86, 189, 201. An \nage-restricted website can also redirect customers to a \nthird-party provider, who typically offers consumers \ntheir choice of age-verification method. J.A.186. Regard-\nless of how a person first contacts a third-party provider, \nthat provider usually relays to the purveyor of the age-\nrestricted product only the answer to a single question: \nIs this person 18 years or older? Yes or No. J.A.185.  \nThis process is not one that adults must undertake \nevery time they wish to access pornographic material on \nthe internet. Instead, an age-verified person may travel \nthrough the internet with a token that signifies their sta-\ntus as an adult\u2014and nothing more\u2014to each age-re-\nstricted website they visit. J.A.186, 197-98.  \n2. Age verification has become an increasingly \n\n10 \n \ncommon feature of online commerce. The pornographic \nwebsite OnlyFans, for example, uses Yoti, one of the \nworld\u2019s largest third-party providers. J.A.181. And after \nthe public relations and legal crises resulting in the re-\nmoval of millions of videos, Pornhub also began using \nYoti to verify the ages of content providers\u2014but not con-\ntent viewers. J.A.181. Pornhub and others have age-ver-\nification technology built into their systems. J.A.285. \nCountries around the world require age verification \nfor online pornography, including Australia, France, \nGermany, and the United Kingdom. Last year, the Eu-\nropean Union ordered three of the largest online pornog-\nraphers (Pornhub, XVideos and Stripchat) to verify the \nage of users. BBC, Porn Viewers in EU May Have to \nProve Their Age (Dec. 20, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y3R2-\nGXLV.  \nNor does age verification suggest that an adult views \npornography. J.A.203. This service \u201cis widely used by \nthousands of sellers and their consumers on a daily basis \naround the world, in a variety of contexts\u201d that have \nnothing to do with pornography. J.A.181, 209. For exam-\nple, the millions of customers who use DraftKings for \nfantasy sports betting must verify their ages using a \nthird-party verification provider. See, e.g., IDTech, So-\ncure to Provide Biometric Onboarding Tech for \nDraftKings (Apr. 9, 2021), https://perma.cc/7VFG-\nWTDX. Age verification thus is not only doable\u2014it\u2019s al-\nready being done. J.A.181, 209. \nII. H.B. 1181 \nIn H.B. 1181, Texas enacted an age-verification re-\nquirement to address three realities: (1) the internet con-\ntains vast amounts of obscenity easily accessed by kids, \n(2) today\u2019s online obscenity is especially harmful to chil-\ndren, and (3) age-verification technology is increasingly \n\n11 \n \ncommon across industries and allows websites to identify \nwhen their customers are children.  \nSpecifically, H.B. 1181 requires pornographic web-\nsites to \u201cuse reasonable age verification methods\u201d to ver-\nify that a customer \u201cis 18 years of age or older.\u201d Tex. Civ. \nPrac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002(a).2 It applies to commer-\ncial entities that \u201cknowingly and intentionally publish[] \nor distribute[] material on an Internet website, including \na social media platform, more than one-third of which is \nsexual material harmful to minors.\u201d Id.  \nH.B. 1181 defines \u201c[s]exual material harmful to mi-\nnors\u201d based on this Court\u2019s test for obscenity to encom-\npass material that (1) \u201cappeal[s] to or pander[s] to the \nprurient interest\u201d when taken as a whole and with re-\nspect to minors; (2) describes, displays or depicts \u201cin a \nmanner patently offensive with respect to minors\u201d vari-\nous sex acts and portions of the human anatomy, includ-\ning depictions of \u201csexual intercourse, masturbation, sod-\nomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation, [and] excre-\ntory functions\u201d; and (3) \u201clacks serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value for minors.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.001(6); \ncompare Miller, 413 U.S. at 24-25.  \nTo comply with H.B. 1181, a covered website need not \nchange anything it posts. Instead, it must require cus-\ntomers to (1) \u201cprovide digital identification\u201d or (2) \u201ccom-\nply with a commercial age verification system that veri-\nfies age using\u201d a \u201cgovernment-issued identification\u201d or \n\u201ccommercially reasonable method that relies on public or \nprivate transactional data to verify the age of an \n \n2 H.B. 1181 also requires such websites to provide health warn-\nings about the dangers of pornography. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.004(1). The district court enjoined that provision, \nPet.App.136a-50a; the Fifth Circuit affirmed the injunction, \nPet.App.27a-38a; and Texas has not sought relief from this Court. \n\n12 \n \nindividual.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.003(b). \nCovered websites thus may use third-party providers \nlike Yoti. And to ensure user privacy, the age-verifier \n\u201cmay not retain any identifying information of the indi-\nvidual.\u201d Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). And, of course, if a covered \nwebsite is concerned that an age-verification provider \nmay wrongly transmit information to others, it can \nchoose a different provider or do age verification itself. \nId. \u00a7129B.003(b). \nH.B. 1181 empowers the Attorney General to bring \ncivil-enforcement actions for injunctive relief, civil pen-\nalties, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Id. \u00a7129B.006.  \nIII. Procedural History \nH.B. 1181 was to go into effect on September 1, 2023. \nPet.App.175a. On August 4, 2023, Petitioners brought a \npre-enforcement facial challenge. ROA.16-46. No adult \nviewer of pornography in Texas joined the suit. ROA.20. \nAs relevant here, Petitioners allege that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification requirement violates the First Amend-\nment. ROA.42-43. They moved for a preliminary injunc-\ntion, ROA.54-83, and the district court held a hearing less \nthan three weeks later, ROA.1829-96. The only live wit-\nness was the State\u2019s expert, J.A.267-86, who explained \nthat age verification is \u201cnot new\u201d for pornographic web-\nsites, which \u201cuse it elsewhere in the world,\u201d J.A.285.  \nEight days later, the district court\u2014applying strict \nscrutiny\u2014issued a preliminary injunction facially enjoin-\ning enforcement of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification require-\nment. Pet.App.107a-36a. Yet rather than evaluating the \n\u201cfull range\u201d of H.B. 1181\u2019s applications and then deter-\nmining whether the law\u2019s supposedly \u201cunconstitutional \napplications substantially outweigh its constitutional \nones,\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397, the court refused to \nview even a sample of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \n\n13 \n \nwebsites, ROA.1881. Instead, it insisted that mainstream \nmovies with partial nudity and simulated sex like those \non Netflix are \u201cas raw as any pornography,\u201d ROA.1877-\n78; but see J.A.175 (Xnxx.com\u2019s six categories of \u201cbond-\nage\u201d videos). \nThe Fifth Circuit administratively stayed the district \ncourt\u2019s preliminary injunction and expedited oral argu-\nment. Pet.App.167a-68a. A month later, the court stayed \nthe injunction pending resolution of the appeal. \nPet.App.165a-66a. In March 2024, the Fifth Circuit va-\ncated the injunction of H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification re-\nquirement. Pet.App.8a-27a. It relied on Ginsberg to con-\nclude that \u201cregulations of the distribution to minors of \nmaterials obscene for minors are subject only to ra-\ntional-basis review.\u201d Pet.App.8a. The court distinguished \nReno because the law there was far broader than H.B. \n1181 and Ashcroft II because it did not consider which \nlevel of scrutiny applied. Pet.App.13a-19a. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit then \u201ceasily\u201d concluded Texas satisfied rational-ba-\nsis review. Pet.App.26a-27a. Judge Higginbotham dis-\nsented, concluding that strict scrutiny applied because \nH.B. 1181 limited adult access to protected speech, \nPet.App.47a-48a, and content filtering and the like are \nless restrictive alternatives, Pet.App.76a-78a.3 \nThe Fifth Circuit thereafter denied Petitioners\u2019 re-\nquest to stay issuance of its mandate. Pet.App.162a-63a. \nThis Court denied Petitioners\u2019 emergency application to \nstay the mandate on April 30, 2024. Accordingly, H.B. \n1181\u2019s age-verification requirement has been in effect \nsince September 19, 2023. Following the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, moreover, one prominent pornography website \n \n3 Petitioners also made arguments about vagueness or whether \nthey fall within H.B. 1181\u2019s scope. They do not advance such argu-\nments here.    \n\n14 \n \ncommitted to using an age-verification service. See Press \nRelease, Office of Attorney General of Texas, Texas Se-\ncures Settlement with Operator of Major Pornography \nWebsite, Ensuring Compliance with Texas Law (Apr. \n26, 2024), https://perma.cc/UV63-WPX9.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\u201cFor the first time in the history of humanity, chil-\ndren can easily be exposed to the most extreme, miso-\ngynistic sex acts imaginable, thanks to the phenomenon \nof Internet porn.\u201d David Horsey, Our Social Experi-\nment: Kids with Access to Hard-Core Porn, L.A. Times \n(Sept. 3, 2013), https://perma.cc/9DGH-NZBN. That \u201cso-\ncial experiment,\u201d id., has failed. To address a public-\nhealth crisis, Texas did not restrict adult access to por-\nnography. Instead, Texas imposed an age-verification \nrequirement\u2014just as governments have done the world \nover for this industry and others. Petitioners cannot \nshow that H.B. 1181 is unconstitutional under the correct \nlevel of scrutiny\u2014rational basis\u2014or any other. And they \nespecially cannot make that showing in the context of a \nfacial, pre-enforcement preliminary injunction.   \nI. The Fifth Circuit followed Ginsberg and Sable. \nWhere the level of constitutional scrutiny depends on the \nnature of the audience, Sable allows a State to put the \nonus on the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper. And \nGinsberg\u2014which upheld a State\u2019s power to require \nbrick-and-mortar retailers to prevent children from \nviewing obscenity\u2014employs a rational-basis test.   \nPetitioners offer a bevy of counterarguments, but \neach misfires. H.B. 1181 is not \u201ccontent based\u201d because \nthe question it asks is whether the content is constitu-\ntionally protected in the first place. Such threshold de-\nterminations have never been subjected to strict-scru-\ntiny review. See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. \n\n15 \n \n460, 468-69 (2010). Otherwise, a State could not criminal-\nize speech that facilitates crime without triggering strict \nscrutiny. And the suggestion that States cannot express \ndisapproval of obscenity\u2014a \u201cvalueless\u201d category of \nspeech, Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66, 73 \n(2023)\u2014turns the First Amendment on its head.    \nNor did Ashcroft II overrule Sable and Ginsberg. Be-\ncause it is just as easy for websites to ensure that those \nwishing to gamble, buy alcohol, or view pornography are \nadults as it is for brick-and-mortar shopkeepers, Texas \nacted well within its police power by imposing that re-\nquirement on websites trafficking in hardcore pornogra-\nphy. And if Ashcroft II prevents Texas from requiring \nPetitioners to use the same age-verification services as \ncomparable websites, Ashcroft II must be overruled. Re-\nliable age verification was not on the table twenty years \nago. That is not remotely true today.   \nII.  Even if heightened scrutiny applied, the prelimi-\nnary injunction would still fail. Any heightened standard \ncould only be intermediate scrutiny, but H.B. 1181 would \nclear even strict scrutiny. Not only is Texas\u2019s interest \noverwhelming, H.B. 1181 focuses on websites causing the \nmost harm to children. And as more than two decades of \nfailed filtering confirms, Texas cannot vindicate its inter-\nest in any other way.  \nAgain, Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments fail. They say \nthat H.B. 1181 is not narrowly tailored because Texas \ndoes not regulate every website where obscenity is avail-\nable. Yet Texas \u201cmay focus on [its] most pressing con-\ncerns\u201d and \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. \n433, 449 (2015). Petitioners also urge content filtering \nbut cannot show it is \u201cat least as effective\u201d as age verifi-\ncation. Reno, 521 U.S. at 874. To the contrary, despite \n\n16 \n \nwidespread availability, filtering \u201chas proven an ineffec-\ntive mechanism.\u201d J.A.207.  \nIII. Petitioners also cannot successfully bring a facial \nchallenge. Because such challenges \u201crest on speculation\u201d \nabout how a law will be interpreted and what the facts \nwill reveal, a plaintiff ordinarily must show that the law \nis \u201cunconstitutional in all of its applications.\u201d Wash. State \nGrange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, \n449-50 (2008). Although the Court has shown greater so-\nlicitude to free-speech claims, see, e.g., NetChoice, 144 \nS.Ct. at 2397, a facial injunction blocking enforcement of \na state law is \u201cstrong medicine\u201d presenting significant \nseparation-of-powers concerns, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, \n413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973).  \nPetitioners have not come close to meeting their bur-\nden. Even on the incomplete record before the Court, \nmuch of the content here is plainly obscene\u2014and thus \nconstitutionally unprotected\u2014even for adults. The dis-\ntrict court, however, committed a more egregious ver-\nsion of the error identified in NetChoice. Not only did it \nfail to consider each application of H.B. 1181, it did not \neven consider H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland. Instead, it specu-\nlated about hypothetical applications while refusing to \nreview the content squarely at issue. Petitioners, how-\never, cannot complain that their adult customers\u2019 consti-\ntutional rights have been chilled based on content that \nthose customers have no constitutional right to view. \nIV. Finally, a preliminary injunction is an \u201cextraordi-\nnary remedy\u201d that is never awarded as of right. Winter \nv. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Instead, a plaintiff \n\u201cmust establish\u201d not only \u201cthat he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits,\u201d but also \u201cthat he is likely to suffer irrepara-\nble harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d and \u201cthat \nan injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Id. at 20. Here, \n\n17 \n \neven if Petitioners satisfied their burden with respect to \nthe merits, they flunked the other requirements. They \ndid not identify a single adult who has been chilled from \nvisiting their websites, and they cannot show that any \n(nonexistent) injury outweighs harm to children. En-\nforcement of H.B. 1181 has been permitted for more than \na year and the sky has not fallen. The Court should retain \nthat status quo while litigation continues.   \nARGUMENT \nI. The Fifth Circuit Applied the Correct Test. \nBecause H.B. 1181 imposes a gatekeeping function \nthat forecloses only minors from accessing obscenity, \nthe Fifth Circuit properly applied Ginsberg\u2019s rational-\nbasis analysis. Pet.App.8a-10a. Petitioners do not ques-\ntion that Ginsberg states the proper test for minors\u2019 ac-\ncess to such content, only (at 20-21) whether Ginsberg \napplies when the question is whether prohibiting access \nby minors allegedly impedes access by adults. Petition-\ners are wrong: Requiring commercial enterprises to take \ncommercially reasonable steps to verify that their cus-\ntomers are adults need only be a rational way to combat \nthe harms that even Petitioners accept (at 3) their prod-\nucts cause children. \nA. Ginsberg\u2019s rational-basis test governs. \n1. In Ginsberg, New York took this Court\u2019s then-ex-\nisting definition of obscenity and adjusted it for kids. 390 \nU.S. at 635. Thus, the State decreed that material \n\u201c[h]armful to minors\u201d included content that \u201cpredomi-\nnantly appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid inter-\nest of minors\u201d and \u201cis utterly without redeeming social \nimportance for minors,\u201d among other elements. Id. at \n646. New York then made it unlawful for businesses to \nknowingly sell such material to minors, but provided that \n\n18 \n \nan honest mistake about age would excuse liability if the \nshopkeeper made a \u201creasonable bona fide attempt\u201d to as-\ncertain the customer\u2019s age. Id. at 631, 646. One obvious \nway to do so was by reviewing identification. See, e.g., \nLeading Cases: Freedom of Speech and Expression, 118 \nHarv. L. Rev. 353, 363 & n.85 (2004). \nConsidering a First Amendment challenge to the law, \nthe Court first concluded that a child\u2019s rights do not pre-\nvent States from defining obscenity based on its appeal \nto minors. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 637-39. The Court then \nidentified two interests to support the law: (1) parental \ninterests in deciding whether their children should view \nsuch material, and (2) the State\u2019s independent interest in \nthe well-being of children. Id. at 639-41. Because \u201cob-\nscenity is not protected expression,\u201d the Court required \nonly that New York have made a \u201crational\u201d decision that \nexposure to such material be harmful to minors. Id. at \n641-43. Concluding New York had, the Court rejected \nthe constitutional challenge. Id. \nSince deciding Ginsburg, the Court has reiterated its \nholdings many times. In Erznoznik v. City of Jackson-\nville, for example, the Court cited Ginsberg for the \u201cwell \nsettled\u201d proposition that governments \u201ccan adopt more \nstringent controls on communicative materials available \nto youths than on those available to adults.\u201d 422 U.S. 205, \n212 (1975). In Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., a \nplurality considering zoning rules for adult movie thea-\nters invoked Ginsberg to explain that \u201cthe Members of \nthe Court who would accord the greatest protection to \nsuch materials have repeatedly indicated that the State \ncould prohibit the distribution or exhibition of such ma-\nterials to juveniles and unconsenting adults.\u201d 427 U.S. \n50, 69 (1976) (plurality op.) And in Brown, the Court ex-\nplained\u2014without qualification\u2014that because \u201cobscenity \n\n19 \n \nis not protected expression,\u201d laws like that at issue in \nGinsberg that address obscenity for children need only \nbe rational. 564 U.S. at 794. \n2. The Court\u2019s decision in Sable makes explicit what \nwas already implicit in Ginsberg: Where the level of con-\nstitutional protection depends on the audience, States \nmay require the speaker to serve as the primary gate-\nkeeper to that audience. 492 U.S. at 125-26. The federal \nlaw at issue in Sable prohibited making, by way of an in-\nterstate telephone call, \u201cany obscene or indecent commu-\nnication for commercial purposes.\u201d Id. at 123 n.4. Sable \noperated \u201cdial-a-porn\u201d phone lines, offering prere-\ncorded, sexually explicit messages. Id. at 117-18. Uphold-\ning the ban on \u201cobscene\u201d phone calls, the Court explained \nthat the statute did not impose a national standard of ob-\nscenity but instead relied on \u201ccontemporary community \nstandards,\u201d as required by Miller. Id. at 124-25.   \nJudged by each individual community\u2019s standards, \nthe same recorded messages might be considered ob-\nscene (and therefore unprotected by the First Amend-\nment) in some communities but not obscene (and there-\nfore protected) in others. Id. at 125-26. Sable objected \nthat it was not its burden as speaker to distinguish be-\ntween those listeners. This Court disagreed, holding that \n\u201c[i]f Sable\u2019s audience is comprised of different communi-\nties with different local standards, Sable ultimately \nbears the burden of complying with the prohibition on \nobscene messages.\u201d Id. at 126. The Court recognized that \nSable might be \u201cforced to incur some costs\u201d to develop \nand implement its own \u201csystem\u201d to determine the locale \nof incoming calls but found \u201cno constitutional impedi-\nment\u201d to the imposition of such costs. Id. at 125.  \nThe principle from Sable is thus plain: Where a \nspeaker\u2019s audience consists of two groups\u2014one to whom \n\n20 \n \nthe speaker has the right to speak a particular message \nand another to whom the speaker does not\u2014the State \nmay place the onus on the speaker to distinguish be-\ntween the groups. See id. at 126. Such a rule makes \nsense. It is less invasive on speech when the speaker as-\nsesses his own listeners, rather than when the govern-\nment does so. Thus, even if distinguishing between lis-\nteners imposes costs, a State may require the speaker to \nserve as gatekeeper. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. ACLU (Ash-\ncroft I), 535 U.S. 564, 583 (2002) (plurality op.); see also \nid. at 582 (\u201cIn [Sable], this Court made no effort to eval-\nuate how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn \noperators to tailor their messages [because] the burden \nof complying with the statute rested with those compa-\nnies.\u201d). \n3. The Fifth Circuit thus correctly recognized that \nGinsberg controls this case: H.B. 1181 adjusts this \nCourt\u2019s definition of obscenity as it applies to minors, \nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); does not bar \nadult access to material that is obscene as to minors; is \nsupported by the same state interests as in Ginsberg that \nhave only grown more compelling; and is rationally re-\nlated to those interests (a point Petitioners do not con-\ntest).  \nTrue, one distinction between H.B. 1181 and the New \nYork law in Ginsberg is that H.B. 1181 makes age verifi-\ncation mandatory, id. \u00a7129B.002(a), while New York \nmade it an affirmative defense, Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. \nBut this distinction is immaterial: Operationally, to avoid \ncriminal conviction, New York retailers that sold mate-\nrial considered obscene for minors had to ascertain the \nage of the person buying it\u2014an assessment that could be \nmade by looking at the person or by requesting other \nproof of age. And the other main distinction between the \n\n21 \n \nNew York law and this one cuts in favor of H.B. 1181. \nWhereas the New York law was a criminal provision that \ncarried with it the risk of one year in prison, id. at 633 \nn.2, H.B. 1181 is a civil provision. Ginsberg thus applies \na fortiori. \nIndeed, H.B. 1181 addresses a situation remarkably \nsimilar to Sable: speech that is obscene and therefore un-\nprotected for one community (children) but\u2014argua-\nbly4\u2014not obscene and therefore protected for another \ncommunity (adults). To be even more precise, H.B. 1181 \naddresses speech that is unprotected for minors in \nTexas. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6). Thus, \nPetitioners can comply with H.B. 1181 by leaving the \nState\u2014as Pornhub has done. William Melhado, Pornhub \nSuspends Site in Texas Due to State\u2019s Age-Verification \nLaw, \nTex. \nTribune \n(Mar. \n14, \n2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/N9K6-W7CL. But \u201c[i]f a publisher \nchooses to send its material\u201d to Texas, \u201cthis Court\u2019s ju-\nrisprudence teaches that it is the publisher\u2019s responsibil-\nity to abide by that community\u2019s standards.\u201d Ashcroft I, \n535 U.S. at 583 (plurality op.) (following Sable, 492 U.S. \nat 125-26).   \n4.  None of the forgoing analysis changes merely be-\ncause H.B. 1181 addresses the internet\u2014not magazine \nstands. First Amendment principles \u201cdo[] not change be-\ncause the [interaction] has gone from the physical to the \nvirtual world.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2393. The gate-\nkeeping function performed by the 1960s shopkeeper is \nnow performed by websites using age-verification tech-\nnology. Notably, Sable did not involve a brick-and-mor-\ntar building, but this Court nonetheless held that if a \n \n4 In reality, much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 websites is ob-\nscene even as to adults. See supra pp.4-5; infra p.43.  \n\n22 \n \ncompany in the speech business wishes to operate na-\ntionally, it must adjust its \u201csystem\u201d to ensure that every \naudience member in each community may lawfully hear \nits message. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125. As Sable confirms, it \nis constitutionally irrelevant that such adjustments may \nrequire the company itself to \u201cscreen[]\u201d would-be cus-\ntomers, contract with a third party to do it, or leave the \nmarket. Id. Nor did the imposition of such \u201cburdens\u201d \ntrigger strict scrutiny. Contra Pet.Br.32. \nIt would be odd\u2014to say the least\u2014for this Court to \n(1) permit States to require speakers to serve as gate-\nkeepers for their own audiences without any additional \nscrutiny, see Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; and (2) cite Ginsberg \nfor the rule that States need only have a rational basis to \nrestrict minors\u2019 access to pornography, e.g., Erznoznik, \n422 U.S. at 212; yet (3) impose strict scrutiny on a re-\nquirement that pornographers take reasonable steps to \nensure their audiences don\u2019t include children. In fact, \nsuch a doctrine would not just be odd\u2014it would be inco-\nherent.    \nB. Petitioners\u2019 theories are unpersuasive. \nPetitioners disagree, but their theories overlook \nprecedent, misread precedent, or miss the point. Re-\ngardless, if Ashcroft II means what Petitioners say, the \nCourt should overrule it because it would contradict \nother precedent and rest on untrue factual premises. \n1. In challenging the Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \nthe rational-basis standard, Petitioners insist (e.g., at 24-\n27) that because H.B. 1181 is a \u201ccontent-based\u201d re-\nstriction on speech, it must trigger strict scrutiny. Both \nthe major and the minor premise are wrong. This Court \nhas \u201creject[ed] \u2026 the view that any examination of \nspeech or expression inherently\u201d makes a law content \nbased and \u201ctriggers heightened First Amendment \n\n23 \n \nconcern.\u201d City of Austin v. Reagan Nat\u2019l Advert. of Aus-\ntin, LLC, 596 U.S. 61, 73 (2022). Moreover, though the \nCourt has applied strict scrutiny to some content-based \nrestrictions, e.g., United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Grp., \nInc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), many laws that in one \nsense are \u201ccontent based\u201d are not subject to strict scru-\ntiny, see, e.g., FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 745 \n(1978) (plurality op.).  \nHere, H.B. 1181 is not a content-based restriction on \nprotected speech. It is a requirement that speakers serve \nas the gatekeeper when their speech is unprotected as to \ncertain listeners. Under cases like Sable, such a require-\nment is entirely permissible. And because H.B. 1181 in-\nvolves protecting minors from exposure to hardcore por-\nnography, it is subject to rational-basis scrutiny. \na. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 view, not every regula-\ntion of expression that turns in some sense on content is \nsubject to strict scrutiny. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he ques-\ntion whether speech is[] or is not protected by the First \nAmendment often depends on the content of the speech.\u201d \nNew York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 763 (1982) (quoting \nAm. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. at 66 (plurality op.)). One \ncannot tell if speech is unprotected incitement, defama-\ntion, a true threat, or integral to a crime without consid-\nering its content. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-69. \nRegulations of commercial speech, Zauderer v. Office of \nDisciplinary Counsel of Sup. Ct. of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, \n638 (1985), and bans against solicitation, Heffron v. Int\u2019l \nSoc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647 \n(1981), similarly turn on content. Applying these well-es-\ntablished principles, H.B. 1181 is not a regulation of pro-\ntected speech but a law controlling access by a particular \ncommunity to unprotected speech. \n\n24 \n \nBecause it has always been understood that the First \nAmendment allows \u201crestrictions upon the content of \nspeech\u201d in these limited areas, restrictions limited to \nthose areas are not subject to strict scrutiny. Counter-\nman, 600 U.S. at 73 (quoting Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468). \nH.B. 1181 addresses perhaps the prototypical example of \nsuch an area of unprotected expression: materials that \nare obscene for minors. See, e.g., Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-\n69. Because H.B. 1181 does nothing more than create a \nmechanism to distinguish between minors and adults\u2019 \nability to access materials that are not protected as to \nminors, it cannot be subject to strict scrutiny.5 \nb. Obscenity, which the Court has described as \u201cval-\nueless material,\u201d Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73, is one cat-\negory of \u201cspeech\u201d that is \u201cnot protected,\u201d Smith v. Cali-\nfornia, 361 U.S. 147, 152 (1959). \u201cAt the time of the adop-\ntion of the First Amendment, obscenity law was not as \nfully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently con-\ntemporaneous evidence to show that obscenity, too, was \noutside the protection intended for speech and press.\u201d \nRoth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483 & n.13 (1957); \nsee also id. at 485 n.17 (listing federal obscenity laws). \nAccordingly, the regulation or prohibition of obscenity is \nnot subject to strict scrutiny, even though one has to see \nit to know it. See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. \n87 (1974) (criminalizing obscenity). Even the dissenters \nin Reagan agreed that governments may prohibit ob-\nscenity\u2014a \n\u201ccontent-based \nrestriction[]\u201d\u2014without \n \n5 Petitioners spill considerable ink (at 16-19) defending speech \nthat is (allegedly) not obscene as to minors or adults. It is unclear, \nhowever, how much of that speech Petitioners make. Because the \npreliminary-injunction record does not answer that question, this \npoint cannot support their facial challenge. See NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. \nat 2398-99. \n\n25 \n \nmeeting strict scrutiny. 596 U.S. at 87 n.1 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting). \nThis rule does not change merely because the line \nhere concerns obscenity for minors. Speech is generally \nconsidered obscene if the \u201caverage person, applying con-\ntemporary community standards,\u201d would conclude that \n\u201cthe work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient in-\nterest.\u201d Miller, 413 U.S. at 24. In determining whether a \ndepiction is or \u201cis not protected expression,\u201d govern-\nments can consider whether the audience comprises \nadults or children. Brown, 564 U.S. at 794 (discussing \nGinsberg). Accordingly, the fact that H.B. 1181 requires \nconsidering the content of speech to determine whether \nit is protected by the First Amendment as to minors does \nnot require the application of strict scrutiny. \n2. In arguing to the contrary, Petitioners point (at \n21-23) to Ashcroft II, Sable, Playboy, and Reno for the \nproposition that strict scrutiny applies to alleged bur-\ndens on adult access to speech even if that same speech \nis unprotected for minors. These cases, however, are in-\napposite because each involved a law that banned pro-\ntected speech for all listeners\u2014not, as H.B. 1181 does, \nrequire the speaker to serve as the gatekeeper to ensure \nthose individuals who have a constitutional right to do so \n(and only those individuals) can access the material. \na. The Fifth Circuit concluded that the Child Online \nProtection Act (COPA) at issue in Ashcroft II is the clos-\nest analog to H.B. 1181. Pet.App.16a. Like H.B. 1181, \nCOPA defined material that was \u201charmful to minors\u201d us-\ning the Miller standard. 542 U.S. at 661. But, unlike H.B. \n1181, COPA criminalized posting such information to the \ninternet for \u201ccommercial purposes.\u201d Id. COPA involved \nage verification in some sense, but only as an affirmative \ndefense: A criminal defendant could avoid liability by \n\n26 \n \nrestricting access to obscene-for-minors material by re-\nquiring, among other things, a credit card, adult access \ncode, digital age certificate, or measures feasible under \nexisting technology. Id. at 662.  \nAshcroft II is irrelevant here for at least three rea-\nsons.  \nFirst, COPA placed a greater burden on speech than \nH.B. 1181. It was a criminal statute that used age verifi-\ncation only as a defense, so there was no guarantee \nagainst prosecution. See, e.g., Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 674 \n(Stevens, J., concurring). Criminal statutes often require \ngreater scrutiny. See, e.g., City of Houston v. Hill, 482 \nU.S. 451, 459 (1987). By contrast, H.B. 1181 is a civil stat-\nute and so is not \u201cenforced by severe criminal penalties.\u201d \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 660.   \nSecond, the Court did not purport to overrule Sable \nor to limit Ginsberg to brick-and-mortar shopping. In-\nstead, the Court barely addressed either case, and never \nmentioned the relevant portion of Sable addressing when \ngovernments can require speakers to act as gatekeepers. \nThe Court does not lightly toss aside foundational legal \nprinciples (as opposed to fact-heavy analysis), and cer-\ntainly did not do it without saying so. Further, the Court \nrecognized that the 5-year-old record did not \u201creflect \ncurrently technological reality.\u201d Id. at 671. Accordingly, \nfor case-specific reasons, age verification was seen as a \nmaterial burden rather than a manageable gatekeeping \nobligation. Here, by contrast, because of technological \nadvances, it is now far easier and less invasive to age ver-\nify; in fact, it can be done via software that does not even \nretain facial images. J.A.190-91. \nThird, as the Fifth Circuit explained, no one con-\ntested strict scrutiny\u2019s application in Ashcroft II. This \nCourt\u2019s rule \u201cin both civil and criminal cases\u201d is to \u201crely \n\n27 \n \non the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign \nto courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties \npresent.\u201d Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 243 \n(2008). In fact, \u201cour system is designed around the prem-\nise that parties represented by competent counsel know \nwhat is best for them, and are responsible for advancing \nthe facts and arguments entitling them to relief.\u201d United \nStates v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U.S. 371, 375-76 (2020) \n(cleaned up). Because the government did not argue for \na lesser burden, the Court was not obligated to make an \nargument for it. Pet.App.19a. \nc. None of Petitioners\u2019 other three cases establish \nthat H.B. 1181 is subject to strict scrutiny.  \nFirst, Petitioners\u2019 reliance on Sable (at 21) is selec-\ntive. As explained above, Sable\u2019s gatekeeping analysis\u2014\nwhich Petitioners do not address\u2014squarely supports \nH.B. 1181. The Court in Sable also upheld an outright \nban on \u201cobscene\u201d telephone calls because \u201cprotection of \nthe First Amendment does not extend to obscene \nspeech.\u201d 492 U.S. at 124. Granted, the Court applied \nstrict scrutiny to the ban on \u201cindecent\u201d communications, \nnoting that \u201c[s]exual expression which is indecent but not \nobscene is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d Id. at \n126. Although the government attempted to justify the \ncomplete ban on indecent calls as necessary to protect \nminors, the Court recognized that other means were \navailable to vindicate that interest\u2014namely, requiring \nSable to screen its customers. Id. at 128. As that is what \nH.B. 1181 requires covered websites to do, it is hard to \nsee how Sable helps Petitioners. \nSecond, Playboy concerned what amounted to a ban \non speech that was not obscene. The Telecommunica-\ntions Act of 1996 required cable operators who provided \nchannels \u201cprimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented \n\n28 \n \nprogramming\u201d to scramble those channels or limit their \ntransmission to nighttime hours. 529 U.S. at 806. Rele-\nvant here, it was undisputed that the material at issue \nwas not obscene, and therefore that the law was a con-\ntent-based restriction on protected speech. Id. at 811-12. \nBecause scrambling was not guaranteed to be effective \ndue to signal bleed, most operators were effectively \nforced not to transmit such speech outside of nighttime \nhours. Id. at 806-07. This, in turn, prevented adults from \nviewing such materials for two-thirds of the day. Id. at \n812. Because the statute prohibited adults from viewing \nconstitutionally protected speech, this Court held it was \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 813. The Court did not \naddress whether the content at issue constituted obscen-\nity for children, let alone what the analysis would be for \na law that limited only children\u2019s right to access such ma-\nterials during daylight hours. \nThird, Reno concerned the Communications Decency \nAct (CDA), the \u201cbreadth\u201d of which was \u201cwholly unprece-\ndented.\u201d 521 U.S. at 877. The CDA criminalized the \nonline transmission of \u201cany comment, request, sugges-\ntion, proposal, image, or other communication which is \nobscene or indecent\u201d to someone known to be a minor. \nId. at 859 (emphasis added). In defining affected mate-\nrial, the CDA also prohibited \u201cpatently offensive\u201d com-\nmunications involving sexual activities and organs but \ndid not fully parrot the Court\u2019s obscenity precedent. Id. \nat 860. Thus, the CDA applied to far more speech than \nobscenity for minors. Further, because it applied \n\u201cbroadly to the entire universe of cyberspace,\u201d id. at 868, \nanyone posting had to assume a minor was present and \n\u201cin the absence of a viable age verification process\u201d cen-\nsor their speech accordingly, id. at 876.  \n\n29 \n \nTo the extent that Reno is relevant at all, it rebuts \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt to cabin Ginsberg (at 20-21, 30-31) \nas holding only that a State may define obscenity with \nrespect to minors. If that were true, Reno would have \nbeen much shorter. The Court would not have needed to \ndistinguish the CDA from the New York law in Ginsberg \nin at least four respects: the CDA (1) did not allow par-\nents to consent to the speech, (2) applied to non-commer-\ncial transactions, (3) used a much broader definition of \ncovered content, and (4) defined minors as those under \n18. 521 U.S. at 865-66. Instead, the Court could have \nsimply said Ginsberg answered a different question.  \nThe Fifth Circuit properly noted that at least three \nof the distinctions identified in Reno are inapplicable to \nH.B. 1181. Pet.App.13a-15a. Under H.B. 1181, so long as \nparents age verify themselves, they may allow their chil-\ndren to view any material on covered websites. See Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.002. H.B. 1181 applies \nonly to commercial entities whose websites contain more \nthan one-third harmful material. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a). H.B. \n1181 also closely follows the Court\u2019s definition of obscen-\nity. Id. \u00a7129B.001(6). And while H.B. 1181 defines minor \nas an individual under 18 rather than 17, id. \n\u00a7129B.001(3), that is a distinction without a difference \nhere, especially for a facial challenge. Thus, just as the \nReno Court distinguished the New York law in Ginsberg \nfrom the CDA, this Court should distinguish H.B. 1181 \nfrom the CDA. \nC. If Ashcroft II requires strict scrutiny, it \nshould be overruled. \nTexas does not believe that Ashcroft II requires ap-\nplication of strict scrutiny here. If the Court disagrees, \nhowever, so much the worse for Ashcroft II. Under Peti-\ntioners\u2019 theory, Ashcroft II ran roughshod over Sable \n\n30 \n \nand Ginsberg while creating an untenable distinction be-\ntween cyberspace and brick-and-mortar commerce\u2014\nsomething this Court refused to do in NetChoice. Doctri-\nnally, it makes no sense that a State can require an of-\nfline merchant to verify that a customer is not a child\u2014\u00e0 \nla Ginsberg\u2014but cannot do the same for an online mer-\nchant. After all, the same sort of (supposed) chill exists \nin either forum. E.g., Pet.App.11a (noting Petitioners\u2019 \nadmission). Yet this Court in Ginsberg and Sable allowed \nStates to place the burden on the speaker. \nFurthermore, the facts have changed markedly since \n2004\u2014a key reason to overrule precedent. See, e.g., Ja-\nnus v. Am. Fed\u2019n of State, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., Council \n31, 585 U.S. 878, 924-25 (2018). Although the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s decision not to challenge strict scrutiny in \nAshcroft II may seem strange in retrospect, given the in-\nfancy of the internet and the rudimentary technologies \nat issue, no one then credibly could have claimed that \nage-verification technology reliably and easily distin-\nguished adults from minors. Furthermore, online ob-\nscenity has grown much more dangerous for kids as the \nvolume, production quality, and algorithm usage in-\ncreases\u2014and will grow even more dangerous as AI be-\ncomes more entrenched. The world has changed.  \nII. H.B. 1181 Survives Any Level of Review. \nPetitioners do not argue that H.B. 1181 fails rational-\nbasis review, instead focusing on strict scrutiny. Even if \nheightened scrutiny applied, however, H.B. 1181 would \nclear it. At most, the standard would be intermediate \nscrutiny, but even under strict scrutiny, Texas has a com-\npelling interest and H.B. 1181 appropriately vindicates \nthat interest. Because \u201c[t]his Court \u2026 does not review \nlower courts\u2019 opinions, but their judgments,\u201d Jennings v. \n\n31 \n \nStephens, 574 U.S. 271, 277 (2015), the Court can affirm \non these bases as well.   \nA. At most, intermediate scrutiny applies. \n1. If the Court concludes that the Ginsberg/Sable \nrule does not govern, H.B. 1181 should be subject, at \nmost, to intermediate scrutiny. For decades, this Court \nhas recognized that States may protect children by cre-\nating adult-only spaces. After all, \u201c[t]he ease with which \nchildren may obtain access to broadcast material, cou-\npled with the concerns recognized in Ginsberg, amply \njustify special treatment of indecent broadcasting.\u201d \nPacifica, 438 U.S. at 750. As the internet further eases\u2014\nexponentially\u2014children\u2019s access to even more harmful \nvariations of such material, that rationale applies with \neven greater force. \nSimilar analysis is found in the Court\u2019s secondary-ef-\nfects doctrine. In City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, \nInc., for example, the Court examined a zoning ordinance \nprohibiting adult theaters within 1,000 feet of residential \nzones, family dwellings, churches, parks, or schools. 475 \nU.S. 41, 54 (1986) (quoting Am. Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. \nat 71 (plurality op.)). Like other laws of its kind, applica-\ntion of the ordinance turned (at least in part) on the con-\ntent of the films. Id. at 47. Nevertheless, the Court con-\ncluded that the ordinance was not \u201caimed\u201d at that \u201ccon-\ntent\u201d but \u201crather at the secondary effects of such thea-\nters on the surrounding community.\u201d Id. (emphasis in \noriginal). Because the ordinance was \u201cjustified without \nreference to the content of the regulated speech,\u201d it was \ndeemed \u201ccontent-neutral.\u201d Id. at 48. Thus, the Court \nheld, it was constitutional as long as it was \u201cdesigned to \nserve a substantial governmental interest and allow[ed] \nfor reasonable alternative avenues of communication.\u201d \nId. at 50.  \n\n32 \n \n2. As Justice O\u2019Connor explained in Reno, efforts to \nregulate children\u2019s access to online pornography are best \nunderstood as attempts to translate Renton to cyber-\nspace. 521 U.S. at 889 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part). \nDoing so was infeasible at the time because the internet \nof the 1990s lacked the two characteristics necessary \u201cto \ncreate \u2018adult zones\u2019\u201d: the power to sort by \u201cgeography \nand identity.\u201d Id. (citing Lawrence Lessig, Reading the \nConstitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L.J. 869, 886 \n(1996)). That is, \u201c[a] minor can see an adult dance show \nonly if he enters an establishment that provides such en-\ntertainment,\u201d yet that would be all but impossible to do \nbecause he could not \u201cconceal completely his identity (or, \nconsequently, his age).\u201d Id. Due to technological con-\nstraints, the same could not be said of the internet of the \n1990s and early 2000s. Id. \nBut the internet has fundamentally changed. It is \nnow possible \u201cto exclude persons from accessing certain \nmessages on the basis of their identity\u201d and to treat dif-\nferent jurisdictions differently. Id. at 890. Even apart \nfrom H.B. 1181, many websites use platforms like Yoti to \nage verify individuals. J.A.181. Websites can also distin-\nguish users by geography: Pornhub left the Texas mar-\nket after the Fifth Circuit stayed the district court\u2019s in-\njunction. Melhado, supra. And a host of websites age ver-\nify in jurisdictions all around the world. These facts \ndemonstrate that it is now possible to distinguish adults \nfrom minors and between physical locations online, mak-\ning Renton directly analogous. \n3. Petitioners do not dispute that H.B. 1181 serves a \nsubstantial\u2014indeed, compelling\u2014interest. Accordingly, \nbecause \u201creasonable alternative avenues of communica-\ntion\u201d remain open to Petitioners, Renton, 475 U.S. at 50, \nit follows that H.B. 1181 survives intermediate scrutiny. \n\n33 \n \nA restriction on videos of \u201cteen bondage gangbang[s],\u201d \nJ.A.176, does not \u201cinvade[] the area of freedom of expres-\nsion constitutionally secured to minors,\u201d Ginsberg, 390 \nU.S. at 637. And whether or not such materials can be \ndeemed \u201cartistic, informative, or even essential to im-\nportant parts of career and life,\u201d Pet.Br.1, Petitioners \nare free to produce, publish, and profit from as much of \nthem as the adult market can bear. Accordingly, their \nargument (at 35) that the Fifth Circuit erred in distin-\nguishing between outright bans on speech and burdens \nhas no place in the secondary-effects analysis. \nH.B. 1181 also does not discriminate against speech; \ninstead, content is considered for the sole purpose of de-\ntermining whether it is unprotected speech as to minors. \nH.B. 1181 is thus content neutral for the same reasons \nproducers of materials depicting \u201cactual sexually explicit \nconduct\u201d can be required to maintain records of their \nperformers\u2019 identities and ages to comply with a law de-\nsigned to prevent child pornography. Connection Dis-\ntrib. Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321, 325, 328-29 (6th Cir. \n2009) (en banc).  \n4. Petitioners reject that intermediate scrutiny may \napply based on their misreading of Ashcroft II\u2014rebut-\nted above\u2014and separately (at 34-37) because H.B. 1181 \nsupposedly \u201cembodies speaker-based discrimination.\u201d \nThis latter argument reflects confusion. \nSpeaker-based distinctions are not inherently sus-\npect. For example, laws prohibiting speech integral to \ncriminal conduct do not unconstitutionally discriminate \nagainst would-be criminals because of the message they \nwish to convey. See, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & \nIce Co., 336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949). And Petitioners\u2019 sug-\ngestion (at 35) that counsel for Texas\u2019s accurate charac-\nterization of their products means that legislation \n\n34 \n \nenacted by a different branch of government is subject \nto strict-scrutiny review is bewildering. Petitioners do \nnot dispute that content on their websites constitutes ob-\nscenity for children. Indeed, much of that content is also \nobscene for adults. See, e.g., supra pp.4-5; infra p.43. \nFurthermore, speaker-based discrimination impli-\ncates constitutional concerns only when the government \nuses it as a proxy for viewpoint-based discrimination. See \nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384 (1992). Laws \nsuch as H.B. 1181 regulating those who would otherwise \nspeak harmful and unprotected obscenity to minors do \nnot discriminate based on the speaker, but based on \nwhether the speech is protected in the first place.  \nPetitioners posit (at 35) that Texas\u2019s decision to ex-\nempt search engines or websites with less than one-third \nharmful content means the State has discriminated \nagainst the pornography industry. This is wrong for at \nleast four reasons.  \nFirst, Petitioners misunderstand Texas law: Search \nengines are exempt only to the extent they \u201cprovid[e] ac-\ncess or connection to or from\u201d a website that is not under \ntheir control. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.005. If \na search engine operates\u2014or controls an entity that op-\nerates\u2014a website subject to H.B. 1181, it would no \nlonger be exempt. Id. Likewise and contrary to Petition-\ners\u2019 claim (at 35), social-media companies are not exempt \nfrom H.B. 1181 but must comply with it if they reach the \none-third threshold. Id. \u00a7129B.002(a).  \nSecond, Petitioners presume both that the subjective \nmotivation of a legislator is relevant to the constitutional \ninquiry and that such motivation can be determined \nwithout evidence. Both presumptions are mistaken. The \nburden of showing an improper legislative motive is a \n\u201cdemanding one,\u201d Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 241 \n\n35 \n \n(2001), and \u201cthis Court will not strike down an otherwise \nconstitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit leg-\nislative motive,\u201d United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n383 (1968). \nThird, the Court has already held that governments \ncannot address the epidemic of online pornography\u2019s ef-\nfect on children by \u201cbroadly\u201d regulating \u201cthe entire uni-\nverse of cyberspace.\u201d Reno, 521 U.S. at 868. Given that \nholding, Texas\u2019s choice to regulate only those in the busi-\nness of distributing online obscenity is an effort to com-\nply with precedent\u2014not disregard it. Contra Pet.Br.28. \nIt is instead Petitioners who seek to evade precedent by \nexpanding the law of content- or speaker-based discrim-\nination such that it would render all laws governing un-\nprotected speech subject to strict scrutiny. \nFourth, Petitioners are wrong (at 36) that H.B. 1181\u2019s \nexemptions \u201cdefeat[] the law\u2019s avowed purpose.\u201d This ar-\ngument boils down to the view that H.B. 1181 is underin-\nclusive. Yet underinclusiveness is not fatal, else govern-\nments could only regulate in \u201cone fell swoop\u201d or not at \nall. Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449. Regardless, the idea \nthat a search engine is the same as Pornhub defies cre-\ndulity; Google has not embedded an addictive algorithm \nin its search function. Compare Adler, supra, at 811. And \na State surely can treat websites centered\u2014like a hub\u2014\naround pornography differently than those in which such \ncontent may appear but is hardly the focal point.  \nB. H.B. 1181 also survives strict scrutiny.  \nUltimately, the standard-of-scrutiny question is aca-\ndemic because H.B. 1181 satisfies even strict scrutiny.  \n1. H.B. 1181 serves a critical state interest. The \nCourt said as much in Sable and Petitioners do not con-\ntend otherwise. Rather, they concede (at 3) that Texas \nhas a compelling interest in the well-being of its children \n\n36 \n \nthat would permit regulation of Petitioners\u2019 speech even \nif subjected to strict scrutiny. For good reason. As this \nCourt recognized in Ginsberg, Texas has an independent \ninterest\u2014separate from that of a child\u2019s parents\u2014in the \nwell-being of the children within the State. 390 U.S. at \n640. And as the Fifth Circuit discussed, \u201cthe record is re-\nplete with examples of the sort of damage that access to \npornography does to children.\u201d Pet.App.26a.  \nEven in this preliminary stage of litigation, Texas of-\nfered evidence showing that children exposed to pornog-\nraphy exhibit \u201ca host of mental health afflictions\u201d includ-\ning depression, disassociation, and other behavioral \nproblems such as dating violence, emulating sexual \nstrangulation, and sexual coercion. J.A.160. They are \nalso more likely to use tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. \nJ.A.161. And as the Fifth Circuit observed, exposure to \npornography correlates with an increased likelihood chil-\ndren will view bestiality or child pornography. \nPet.App.26a. It is not by accident that nations all around \nthe world\u2014holding divergent views on a host of social \nconcerns\u2014agree that children should be not exposed to \nhardcore pornography.  \n \n2. H.B. 1181 is also narrowly tailored to the realities \nof today\u2019s increasingly digital world, where the dangers \nof unmonitored and surreptitious internet access by chil-\ndren is omnipresent. See, e.g., supra pp.8-9. In 1997, chil-\ndren could go online only at home or in a crowded venue \nsuch as a classroom or public library. Not so today. In-\nstead, \u201c53% of children have a smartphone by age 11,\u201d \nand \u201cover 95% of teens ages 13 to 17 years hav[e] access \nto a cell phone.\u201d Aliah Richter, et al., Youth Perspectives \non the Recommended Age of Mobile Phone Adoption: \nSurvey Study, 5(4) JMIR Pediatrics & Parenting 1 \n(2022). Even Amish communities worry about online \n\n37 \n \npornography. See, e.g., Kevin Granville & Ashley Gil-\nbertson, In Amish Country, the Future Is Calling, N.Y. \nTimes (Sept. 15, 2017), https://tinyurl.com/amishtimes. \nH.B. 1181 also is not \u201ca wholesale prohibition upon \nadult access to indecent speech.\u201d Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 \n(Scalia, J., concurring). Rather, it protects children from \nthat which is obscene by their standards, by requiring \nthe purveyors to check whether their viewers are chil-\ndren\u2014leaving adults able to access pornography by en-\ngaging in a process that they must complete potentially \nonly once and that applies equally to viewing pornogra-\nphy, buying wine, or renting a car. Supra pp.9-10. Alt-\nhough this requirement may impose a limited (if not de \nminimis) financial burden on Petitioners, they can decide \nhow to minimize that burden by choosing to contract for \nor handle verification themselves. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \nCode \u00a7129B.003; accord Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  \n3. H.B. 1181 is also the least restrictive means to vin-\ndicate Texas\u2019s compelling interest. Because Texas may \nprotect children from exposure to obscenity, \u201cit neces-\nsarily follows that there must be a constitutional means \nof carrying it out.\u201d Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. 863, 869 \n(2015) (cleaned up). Requiring a speaker to check its own \ncustomers\u2019 ages is an appropriate means. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to see a better one. The nation has tried the al-\nternative\u2014content filtering\u2014for twenty years. It has \nnot worked. Texas thus may do the same thing that ju-\nrisdictions around the world are already doing.  \nNor is it a secret why content filtering fails. Filters \nonly work if they are consistently applied, but given the \nubiquity of internet-enabled computers, tablets, phones, \nwatches and even eyeglasses, consistent application is an \nimpossibility. A single child with an unfiltered device can \nexpose all his friends to the vilest obscenity, no matter \n\n38 \n \nthe content-filtering vigilance of other parents. In other \nwords, in a world where internet access is limited to \nclassrooms, libraries, and living rooms, it may be possi-\nble to rely on filters. But as jurisdictions around the \nglobe recognize, that hasn\u2019t been reality for years.      \nC. Petitioners\u2019 response fails.  \nPetitioners offer several contrary arguments, none of \nwhich is persuasive. \n \n1.  To start, Petitioners complain (at 38) that H.B. \n1181 is overinclusive because it applies to \u201can entire web-\nsite\u201d even if only one-third of the material is harmful. But \nif otherwise covered websites were to rigidly segregate \nobscene material, H.B. 1181 presumably would not ap-\nply.6 Like this Court, the Texas Supreme Court con-\nstrues statutes to avoid constitutional concerns. E.g., Os-\nterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 51 (Tex. 2000). And it is \ncertainly possible to construe H.B. 1181 to allow entities \nto subdivide their content in such a way that no age ver-\nification would be required for a child-friendly website. \nBecause this is a pre-enforcement challenge, however, no \nstate court has had the opportunity to answer this ques-\ntion. Regardless, Petitioners have not attempted to \nprove that they, much less a substantial number of such \nwebsites, categorize their offerings that way. See infra \nPart III. \n2. Shifting gears, Petitioners also say (at 38-39) that \nH.B. 1181 is underinclusive because it is limited to web-\nsites that host a substantial amount of obscenity rather \n \n6 Petitioners\u2019 movie example (at 38) illustrates the point. If no \none makes sure that ticket buyers actually go only to their assigned \nscreen and stay there, a State absolutely could forbid a theater \nshowing hardcore obscenity on some screens from selling tickets to \n12-year-olds.   \n\n39 \n \nthan every website with such material. Putting aside the \n\u201csomewhat counterintuitive\u201d nature of arguing that H.B. \n1181 violates the First Amendment by failing to regulate \nmore speakers, \u201cthe First Amendment imposes no free-\nstanding \u2018underinclusiveness limitation.\u2019\u201d Williams-\nYulee, 575 U.S. at 449 (quoting R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 387). \nTexas thus \u201cneed not address all aspects of [the] problem \nin one fell swoop\u201d but instead \u201cmay focus on their most \npressing concerns.\u201d Id. Underinclusiveness is problem-\natic only when it serves as a proxy for viewpoint discrim-\nination. Id. Texas, however, has drawn reasonable\u2014and \nlong permitted\u2014lines.  \nOf course, Texas could have chosen to lower the \u201csex-\nual material harmful to minors\u201d content threshold from \none third of a commercial website\u2019s content, but doing so \nwould increase the burden on online speech, bringing it \ncloser to what was held unconstitutional in Reno, 521 \nU.S. at 877-78. Instead, H.B. 1181 applies to websites de-\nvoted to providing access to pornography. In the words \nof Williams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449, H.B. 1181 \u201caims \nsquarely at the conduct most likely to undermine\u201d the \nhealth of underage Texans: pornographic websites like \nthose run by the Petitioners. Applying Petitioners\u2019 logic, \nTexas would have to regulate either the entire internet, \nor none of it. But \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not put a \nState to that all-or-nothing choice.\u201d Id. at 452. This Court \nshould \u201cnot punish [Texas] for leaving open more, rather \nthan fewer, avenues of expression.\u201d Id.  \n3. Similarly without merit are Petitioners\u2019 conten-\ntions (at 39-41) that H.B. 1181 fails to use the least re-\nstrictive means. Petitioners insist (at 40-41) that because \nthis Court has stated a preference for content filtering \nover the primitive age-verification technologies in the \n1990s, Texas is forever limited to cajoling parents into \n\n40 \n \nusing filtering or requiring companies that provide inter-\nnet-enabled devices to employ it. Indeed, Petitioners \nlargely give up the game when they say (at 41 n.6) that \nthe States can require device manufacturers and inter-\nnet service providers to age verify, which would block at \nleast the same amount of content if not more. It is thus \nfar from clear that such filtering is less restrictive given \nit could lead to restriction of more content. At the very \nleast, Petitioners have failed to offer sufficient evidence \nto succeed on this ground facially. Infra Part III.  \nAssuming for argument\u2019s sake that content filtering \nis less restrictive, however, that does not answer the \nquestion. Content filtering has existed for decades, yet \nthe problem targeted by H.B. 1181\u2014childhood exposure \nto obscenity\u2014has gotten much worse. \u201cIt is always true, \nby definition, that the status quo is less restrictive than \na new regulatory law.\u201d Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 684 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting)). That is why the least-alterna-\ntive-means analysis requires the proposed alternative to \nbe \u201cat least as effective\u201d as the challenged provision. \nReno, 521 U.S. at 874 (emphasis added). As even the min-\nimal evidence available at this early stage confirms, de-\nspite its wide availability for decades, content filtering \n\u201chas proven an ineffective mechanism\u201d to limit \u201cexpo-\nsure to adult content by minors.\u201d J.A.207.  \nLeaning\u2014tellingly\u2014on an amicus brief, Petitioners \n(at 41) also raise the specter of Virtual Private Networks \n(VPNs). Petitioners point to the contention that \u201ctwenty \npercent of females and thirty-two percent of males be-\ntween the ages of sixteen and twenty-four\u201d use VPNs. \nICMEC.Cert.Br.12-13.7 That claim has not been tested \n \n7 Petitioners did not raise this statistic below, let alone address \nwhether VPN usage was predominantly by those between the ages \n \n\n41 \n \nin discovery, including whether such use is constant or \nsporadic. Even assuming it is true, however, that VPNs \nare used by young adults, that only undercuts Petition-\ners\u2019 argument that H.B. 1181 will do nothing to prevent \nchildren from being exposed to hardcore pornography. \nPre-pubescent children, for example, are particularly \ndrawn to hentai\u2014and there is no evidence they have ac-\ncess to VPNs. Regardless, even if an unknown percent-\nage of older minors (as opposed to young adults) in Texas \nconsistently use VPNs, amici\u2019s numbers suggest that \napproximately 70-80% or more may not be using VPNs. \nThat would powerfully recommend H.B. 1181\u2019s value in \nadvancing Texas\u2019s interest in protecting kids.  \n4. Petitioners and the district court also are wrong \nthat H.B. 1181 should be deemed something other than \nthe least restrictive means based on \u201cprivacy\u201d concerns. \nSpecifically, the district court worried \u201cthe state govern-\nment can log and track\u201d pornography access by imple-\nmenting age verification, Pet.App.125a, and Petitioners \necho that concern here (at 8-9). Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. H.B. 1181 does not require adult pornog-\nraphy viewers to \u201caffirmatively identify themselves.\u201d \nPet.App.125a (emphasis added). Instead, they must only \ncorroborate their age through a method selected by Pe-\ntitioners. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7129B.002-.003. \nAnd far from using age verification to track anyone, \nTexas has made the practice illegal. Id. \u00a7129B.002(b). \nH.B. 1181 thus does not require any record of the \u201cmost \nintimate and personal aspects of people\u2019s lives\u201d at which \nthe government could \u201cpeer,\u201d Pet.App.125a\u2014even if \nTexas wanted to (which it doesn\u2019t).     \n \nof 18 and 24. This argument thus is nowhere addressed in the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision. \n\n42 \n \nIn sum, \u201c[t]he traditional power of government to fos-\nter good morals,\u201d especially those of kids, \u201cha[s] not been \nrepealed by the First Amendment.\u201d City of Erie v. Pap\u2019s \nA.M., 529 U.S. 277, 310 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring). \nH.B. 1181 is Texas\u2019s attempt to protect children from ob-\nscenity without depriving adults of the choice to view \nsuch material. This Court \u201cshould not hastily dismiss the \njudgment of legislators, who may be in a better position \n\u2026 to assess the implications of new technology.\u201d Brown, \n564 U.S. at 806 (Alito, J., concurring). \nIII. H.B. 1181 is Not Facially Unconstitutional. \nEven putting aside the forgoing, the district court\u2019s \nanalysis of this facial challenge cannot possibly be rec-\nonciled with NetChoice.  \nA. Petitioners are not entitled to facial relief. \n1. As the Court explained in NetChoice, facial chal-\nlenges \u201ccome[] at a cost.\u201d 144 S.Ct. at 2397. Not only \nmust courts consider whether \u201cheartland\u201d applications \nare unconstitutional, but also whether \u201ca substantial \nnumber\u201d of the whole universe of \u201capplications are un-\nconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly \nlegitimate sweep.\u201d Id. In other words, plaintiffs must \nshow that \u201ca law\u2019s unconstitutional applications\u201d are \n\u201csubstantially disproportionate.\u201d United States v. Han-\nsen, 599 U.S. 762, 770 (2023). Absent a \u201clopsided ratio,\u201d \n\u201ccourts must handle unconstitutional applications as \nthey usually do\u2014case-by-case.\u201d Id.  \nThe Court reiterated this analysis in United States v. \nRahimi. Rather than focusing on \u201cthe circumstances in \nwhich\u201d a law \u201cwas most likely to be constitutional,\u201d the \nlower court \u201cfocused on hypothetical scenarios where [it] \nmight raise constitutional concerns.\u201d 144 S.Ct. 1889, 1903 \n(2024). But that was \u201cslaying a straw man.\u201d Id. Although \n\n43 \n \nRahimi arose in the Second rather than First Amend-\nment context, the Court\u2019s rejection of \u201chypothetical\u201d sce-\nnarios is also a familiar feature of First Amendment law. \nSee, e.g., Hansen, 599 U.S. at 786 (Thomas, J., concur-\nring) (citing Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 610-11).    \n2. Here, the district court\u2019s facial analysis is defi-\ncient in numerous respects.  \nFirst, the preliminary-injunction record does not re-\nflect how much of the material on Petitioners\u2019 websites is \nalso obscene for adults. As demonstrated above, see su-\npra pp.4-5, the answer to this question is \u201ca lot.\u201d Because \na substantial portion of the content is obscene, it receives \nno First Amendment protection\u2014no matter who is look-\ning. See Counterman, 600 U.S. at 73. If graphic displays \nof \u201cmouth spreaders,\u201d J.A.176, and much else besides, do \nnot satisfy the Miller standard, nothing does.   \nThe district court refused to consider such content (of \nwhich there are petabytes), instead focusing on media \nlike Netflix films. ROA.1877-81. In so doing, it failed \nNetChoice two times over. Not only did it fail to consider \nthe whole universe of applications, but it did not even \nconsider those applications within H.B. 1181\u2019s heartland.  \nSecond, \u201c[t]o justify facial invalidation, a law\u2019s uncon-\nstitutional applications must be realistic, not fanciful.\u201d \nHansen, 599 U.S. at 770. Rather than providing specific \nreal-world examples, however, Petitioners imagine (at \n38) a website in which 35% of the content is harmful to \nminors and 65% is protected political speech. Should \nsuch a unique website exist, it may attempt to bring an \nas-applied challenge, although that challenge would fail \nunder the Ginsberg/Sable rule. But the possibility that \nsuch a site might exist does not show that a \u201csubstantial \nnumber of [H.B. 1181\u2019s] applications are uncon-\n\n44 \n \nstitutional.\u201d NetChoice, 144 S.Ct. at 2397. The district \ncourt committed a similar error. Pet.App.115a. \nThird, Petitioners did not offer evidence of the bur-\nden on adults they hypothesize. Nothing in the record \ndemonstrates that fear of hypothetical hacking of age-\nverification websites has chilled anyone from visiting any \nwebsite\u2014whether it be to access pornography or any of \nthe other services that require such verification. Supra \npp.9-10. There certainly is no evidence that H.B. 1181 \nhas increased the risk of exposure over the status quo. \nFor example, because some Petitioners operate sub-\nscription-based websites, an individual\u2019s credit-card in-\nformation is already subject to hacking. ROA.250-51. \nMore broadly, \u201c[m]odern cell phones are not just another \ntechnological convenience\u201d but instead \u201chold for many \nAmericans the privacies of life.\u201d Riley v. California, 573 \nU.S. 373, 403 (2014) (citation omitted). Thus, a misplaced \nphone containing \u201c[a]n Internet search and browsing his-\ntory \u2026 could reveal an individual\u2019s private interests or \nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 395. There is no evidence that age veri-\nfication materially increases the risk of privacy violations \nabove what already exists for anyone living in the mod-\nern world\u2014and certainly not in a lopsided number of \ncases.  \nB. Petitioners\u2019 response again fails. \nPetitioners\u2019 attempt (at 24-25, 41-43) to preemptively \nrebut Texas\u2019s argument only underscores why a facial in-\njunction is unwarranted.  \nPetitioners first suggest (at 25) that Texas conceded \nat oral argument that Petitioners\u2019 sites do not contain \nmaterial that is obscene for adults. Not so. Counsel said \nthat H.B. 1181 does not restrict an adult\u2019s access to any \nof the content on Petitioners\u2019 sites. Oral Argument,  \nNo. \n23-50627 \n(Oct. \n4, \n2023) \nat \n13:35-14:10, \n\n45 \n \nhttps://bit.ly/4c5B42K. That statement is correct for the \nreasons discussed at length above. It does not follow, \nhowever, that the material is not obscene.  \nThey next argue (at 24, 42) that Texas elsewhere \ncriminalizes obscenity. That is a non sequitur. For any \nsupposed \u201cchill\u201d argument to succeed, the content on Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 websites must be constitutionally protected. \nThat is a question of federal constitutional law\u2014not \nTexas statutory law. Because no one has a First Amend-\nment right to view much of the content on Petitioners\u2019 \nsites, it is beside the point whether Texas has decided not \nto bar adults from viewing that content as part of this \nstatute. What matters is Petitioners cannot leverage the \nFirst Amendment to attack a state law by complaining \nthat some adults might be chilled from viewing content \nthey have no constitutional right to view.8   \nPetitioners also observe (at 42) that this Court af-\nfirmed facial preliminary injunctions in Ashcroft II and \nReno. But the Court did not conduct facial analysis in \nAshcroft II\u2014indeed, neither the word \u201cfacial\u201d or \u201cface\u201d \nis used in the opinion. And in Reno, the statute was ex-\ntraordinarily broad. See supra p.28-29. Not so here. The \nfacts are also different; because age-verification is now \n \n8 Petitioners overread (at 24-25) Reno and Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002), to suggest that the Court \nshould ignore obscenity on their websites. In Free Speech Coalition, \nthe Court addressed a statute that sought \u201cto reach beyond obscen-\nity\u201d and made \u201cno attempt to conform to the Miller standard.\u201d 535 \nU.S. at 240. It covered a wide swath of materials that were not ob-\nscene for anyone and was backed by criminal penalties. Id. at 244, \n246-47. By contrast, H.B. 1181 tracks the Miller standard, ad-\ndresses websites containing an extraordinary volume of obscenity \nfor anyone, and is civil. And in Reno, the Court observed that the \nCDA covered extraordinary amounts of \u201cindecent\u201d but non-obscene \ncontent. 521 U.S. at 871. That is not the situation here.   \n\n46 \n \ncommon across many industries and modern technology \nensures privacy, any notion that a sufficiently large num-\nber of adults may be chilled is not credible.    \nPetitioners assert too (at 42) that \u201cthere are no dis-\ntinctions among covered websites that entitle some to \ngreater constitutional protection than others.\u201d That is \npure question begging. If content on some but not all \nsites is obscene even for adults, then there would be a \n\u201cdistinction\u201d across sites. The district court, however, \nfailed to conduct the required analysis.  \nFinally, Petitioners repeatedly suggest (e.g., 1, 6, 24) \nthat H.B. 1181 captures essentially everything because \nit protects young children, too. Texas, however, did the \nsame thing that New York did in Ginsberg\u2014it took this \nCourt\u2019s obscenity standard and applied it to children. Pe-\ntitioners, however, do not claim that New York\u2019s law \ntherefore captured ordinary \u201csex education content.\u201d \nContra Pet.Br.7. It is beyond implausible that Texas \ncourts will construe H.B. 1181 in such a manner, even \nmore so because such content presumably would not be \n\u201cprurient\u201d and would have \u201cserious \u2026 scientific value for \nminors,\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7129B.001(6); see \nalso Ashcroft I, 535 U.S. at 579 & nn.9-10 (plurality op.). \nRegardless, such issues should be resolved in as-applied \nchallenges. And Petitioners\u2019 suggestion (at 27) that those \nwithout identification will suffer is a red herring. Age-\nverification technology does not require government \nidentification, supra pp.9-10, and even if it did, such an \nargument could be the subject of an as-applied suit. \nIV. Petitioners Flunk the Remaining Factors. \nBecause Petitioners are unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits, this Court need go no further. Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 32-33. Even if Petitioners had made that showing, they \nwould not be entitled to a preliminary injunction.   \n\n47 \n \nFirst, Petitioners have not shown \u201c[p]erhaps the sin-\ngle most important prerequisite for\u201d interim relief\u2014that \nthey are \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm before a deci-\nsion on the merits can be rendered.\u201d 11A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Proce-\ndure \u00a72948.1 (3d ed. Apr. 2023 update). Before the dis-\ntrict court, Petitioners pointed to no evidence that age \nverification has chilled any actual person from accessing \nany website. Nor could they because (1) age verification \nis already a hallmark of many industries, (2) that some-\none has been age verified says nothing about whether \nthat person views pornography, (3) H.B. 1181 forbids \ncovered websites from preserving identifying infor-\nmation, and, (4) regardless, countless adults pay to ac-\ncess Petitioners\u2019 websites with credit cards. It is not \nenough for Petitioners to wave the \u201cchill\u201d flag\u2014they \nneed to prove it. Nor can they rely on compliance costs \nwhen Pornhub and other such websites already have age \nverification built into their systems.     \nSecond, Texas\u2014and millions of children in Texas\u2014\nwill suffer irreparable harm if H.B. 1181 is enjoined, \nwhich has profound consequences for the public interest. \n\u201cAny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuat-\ning statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it \nsuffers a form of irreparable injury.\u201d Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012). But the harm here is even \nmore significant. H.B. 1181 addresses an ongoing crisis. \nAccord United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 614 \n(2000) (noting the \u201cnumerous findings regarding the se-\nrious impact that gender-motivated violence has on vic-\ntims and their families\u201d). Texas is not powerless to ad-\ndress that crisis. The Court thus should again leave the \nstatus quo in place while this litigation continues.   \n\n48 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nOFFICE OF THE  \n  ATTORNEY GENERAL \nP.O.

          "task_beliefs": "My prior belief state established the core analytical task: determining whether the Supreme Court will apply 'strict scrutiny' or 'rational basis' review to Texas H.B. 1181. I had identified the primary information sources (party briefs) but possessed no substantive knowledge of the specific legal arguments.\n\nThis observation of the Petitioner's Merits Brief provides the first concrete data for my prediction, significantly advancing my understanding. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioner's Core Legal Framework Established:** I now have a detailed understanding of the petitioners' legal arguments. Their case is built upon a direct and consistent line of Supreme Court precedents: *Sable Commc\u2019ns v. FCC* (1989), *Reno v. ACLU* (1997), *United States v. Playboy Ent. Grp., Inc.* (2000), and, most critically, *Ashcroft v. ACLU* (2004). The central thesis is that any law imposing a content-based burden on adults' access to constitutionally protected, non-obscene sexual speech is subject to strict scrutiny, even if the law's stated purpose is to protect minors.\n\n*   **Central Precedent Identified:** *Ashcroft v. ACLU* is positioned as the dispositive precedent. Petitioners argue that H.B. 1181 is \"materially identical\" to the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) that the Court reviewed in *Ashcroft*. They directly attack the Fifth Circuit's justification for departing from *Ashcroft*, asserting that the Court applied strict scrutiny based on established First Amendment principles, not on a \"startling omission\" or a concession by the government. The prediction now hinges heavily on whether the Supreme Court agrees that *Ashcroft* is controlling.\n\n*   **Specific Arguments for Strict Scrutiny:** I have learned the petitioners' specific legal claims for why strict scrutiny must apply:\n    1.  **Content-Based Burden:** H.B. 1181 is a content-based regulation because its applicability is triggered by the subject matter of a website (i.e., whether more than one-third is \"sexual material harmful to minors\"). The age-verification requirement is a significant burden on adults' access to this protected speech.\n    2.  **Speaker-Based Discrimination:** The law also discriminates based on the identity of the speaker, targeting websites that are primarily devoted to sexual content while exempting other platforms (like search engines or social media) that may distribute the same or even more of that content.\n\n*   **Arguments for Why the Law Fails Strict Scrutiny:** Petitioners argue that even if the government's interest in protecting minors is compelling, H.B. 1181 is not narrowly tailored. They claim it is both overinclusive (sweeping in vast amounts of protected speech like R-rated movies) and underinclusive (exempting major online distributors of sexual content). Crucially, they argue that a less restrictive and more effective alternative exists: content-filtering software, an alternative the Supreme Court itself highlighted in *Ashcroft*.\n\n*   **Refined Understanding of the Competing Precedents:** The petitioners' brief clarifies the expected clash of precedents. They argue that *Ginsberg v. New York* (1968), which allowed a different obscenity standard for minors, is not the correct framework because it only addresses restrictions on minors. The *Sable-Reno-Playboy-Ashcroft* line of cases, all decided *after* *Ginsberg*, demonstrates that when a law burdens adults' access, strict scrutiny is the rule. This frames the respondent's (Texas's) likely argument: to convince the Court to prioritize the logic of *Ginsberg* over *Ashcroft*.\n\n*   **Confidence and Uncertainty:** My uncertainty is no longer maximal. I now have a robust, precedent-based argument for applying strict scrutiny. The petitioners' case appears strong because it is anchored in a consistent and recent line of the Court's own decisions. My predictive model now shifts from a general question to a specific one: Will the Court follow its ruling in *Ashcroft*, or will it accept the Fifth Circuit's reasoning for distinguishing or departing from it? The next critical piece of evidence will be the respondent's brief, which must directly counter this *Ashcroft*-centric argument.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been significantly deepened by the respondent's (Texas's) merits brief. My prior beliefs, formed from the petitioners' brief, established a strong, precedent-based argument for applying strict scrutiny based on *Ashcroft v. ACLU*. The respondent's brief directly confronts this framework and introduces several alternative legal and factual pathways for the Court, making my predictive model more complex.\n\n*   **Confirmation of the Central Legal Conflict:** The respondent's brief confirms that the core of this case is a battle between two lines of precedent. My prior belief that the case would pit *Ginsberg v. New York* against the *Sable-Reno-Playboy-Ashcroft* line is now fully substantiated. Texas's entire argument is an attempt to elevate *Ginsberg* and diminish or eliminate *Ashcroft*.\n\n*   **Respondent's Core Legal Framework Established:** I now understand Texas's primary argument: *Ginsberg* and its rational-basis test are the correct framework. They argue that since states can regulate minors' access to harmful sexual material in the physical world (bookstores), they should be able to do so online. The case, in their view, is simply about the *means* of translating this established power to the internet, not about a fundamental First Amendment right.\n\n*   **The \"Technology Has Changed\" Argument:** A critical new dimension has been added to the case. Texas directly attacks the foundation of *Ashcroft v. ACLU* by arguing its reasoning is factually obsolete. They claim that *Ashcroft* and prior cases were decided based on the \"technological limitations\" of the time, which made effective age verification impossible without unacceptably burdening adults. Texas asserts that modern, \"commercially reasonable\" age-verification technology has solved this problem, thus distinguishing H.B. 1181 from the law in *Ashcroft* and rendering that precedent's logic inapplicable. My prediction must now account for a potential factual dispute over the efficacy and burden of current technology.\n\n*   **Explicit Call to Overrule Precedent:** In a significant escalation, Texas explicitly argues that \"If *Ashcroft II* requires strict scrutiny, it should be overruled.\" This is a crucial piece of information. It signals an aggressive legal strategy and a belief that the current Court may be willing to reconsider and overturn its own recent First Amendment precedents. This raises the stakes of the case beyond simply interpreting *Ashcroft* to potentially eliminating it.\n\n*   **Alternative/Fallback Arguments Revealed:** Texas is not relying solely on rational basis. I have learned their tiered fallback strategy:\n    1.  **Primary:** *Ginsberg* applies, and the standard is rational basis.\n    2.  **Secondary:** If a higher standard is required, it should be intermediate scrutiny, framing the law as a content-neutral regulation of access akin to zoning laws (*City of Renton*).\n    3.  **Tertiary:** Even if strict scrutiny applies, H.B. 1181 survives it. They argue the law is narrowly tailored because age verification is now effective and less restrictive alternatives like content filters are ineffective, directly contradicting the petitioners' claims and the findings in *Ashcroft*.\n\n*   **Procedural Off-Ramp Identified:** Texas heavily emphasizes that this is a facial, pre-enforcement challenge, which carries a very high burden. They argue the petitioners must show the law is unconstitutional in a \"substantial number of its applications.\" By claiming much of the material is legally obscene even for adults and thus unprotected, Texas provides the Court a procedural path to uphold the law without definitively deciding the level of scrutiny.\n\n*   **Confidence and Uncertainty:** My confidence that the Court will simply follow *Ashcroft* has decreased. Texas has provided the Court with multiple justifications to either distinguish, overrule, or sidestep that precedent. The predictive challenge is no longer a binary choice between rational basis and strict scrutiny. It now involves a decision tree:\n    1.  Does the *Ginsberg* framework for protecting minors override the *Ashcroft* framework for protecting adult access?\n    2.  Has technology advanced so much that the factual basis of *Ashcroft* is no longer valid?\n    3.  Is the Court willing to overrule *Ashcroft*?\n    4.  Can the case be resolved on the narrower procedural ground that a facial challenge fails?\n    The introduction of the \"technology has changed\" argument and the explicit call to overrule precedent are the most significant updates to my belief state, shifting the focus from a settled legal question to a dynamic one involving factual disputes and the potential for a major change in First Amendment doctrine.",

Therefore, the Task EIG is extremely high. The Design EIG is also high because it tests and refines a core tenet of SCOTUS prediction: modeling the influence of the SG. Observing the SG's arguments and their subsequent treatment by the Court provides a crucial data point for improving the general prediction strategy, making this a highly valuable action for both the specific task and the overall design.",

Congress has previ-\nously enacted laws with the same objective, including a \nstatute that the court of appeals described as \u201cvery sim-\nilar\u201d to the law at issue here.  Pet. App. 16a; see Ashcroft \nv. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 661-663 (2004).  Congress may \nlegislate in this area again.  Cf. Kids Online Safety and \nPrivacy Act, S. 2073, 118th Cong., 2d Sess. (as passed \nby the Senate, July 30, 2024).  The United States there-\nfore has a substantial interest in the development of the \napplicable First Amendment principles. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT  \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1. This Court has long recognized that the govern-\nment has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in protecting minors \nfrom exposure to harmful sexual material, even mate-\nrial \u201cthat is not obscene by adult standards.\u201d  Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989); \nsee Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 640-641 (1968).  \nUntil the 1990s, shielding children from sexual content \nwas a matter of restricting their access to explicit mov-\nies, periodicals, and the like.  See, e.g., Erznoznik v. \nCity of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 206 (1975) (\u201cfilms \ncontaining nudity\u201d); Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 631 (porno-\ngraphic magazines).  But the advent of the Internet \nmade an unprecedented amount of \u201csexually explicit \nmaterial, including hardcore pornography,\u201d accessible \nto children with unprecedented ease.  Ashcroft v. \nACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 566-567 (2002) (Ashcroft I\u200a).  Con-\ngress and state legislatures have passed a variety of \nlaws in an attempt to address that problem. \nFor present purposes, the most relevant federal ef-\nfort was the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 \nU.S.C. 231.  Enacted in 1998, COPA generally author-\nized criminal and civil penalties for anyone who used the \nInternet to \u201cmake[] any communication for commercial \npurposes that is available to any minor and that includes \nany material that is harmful to minors.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n231(a).  COPA included an affirmative defense for a de-\nfendant who, \u201cin good faith, has restricted access by mi-\nnors to material that is harmful to minors\u201d by \u201crequir-\ning use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, \nor adult personal identification number,\u201d \u201cby accepting \na digital certificate that verifies age,\u201d or \u201cby any other \n\n3 \n \nreasonable measures that are feasible under available \ntechnology.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 231(c)(1). \nCOPA defined \u201cmaterial that is harmful to minors\u201d \nas material \u201cthat is obscene\u201d or that would satisfy this \nCourt\u2019s test for obscenity if the test were adapted to a \nminor\u2019s perspective.  47 U.S.C. 231(e)(6); see Miller v. \nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  Thus, material would be \ncovered if, among other things, \u201cthe average person, ap-\nplying contemporary community standards, would find, \ntaking the material as a whole and with respect to mi-\nnors, [that it] is designed to appeal to, or is designed to \npander to, the prurient interest.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 231(e)(6)(A) \n(emphasis added); cf. Miller, 413 U.S. at 24.  In Ash-\ncroft I, this Court considered whether \u201cCOPA\u2019s reliance \non community standards to identify \u2018material that is \nharmful to minors\u2019\u200a\u201d rendered the statute facially uncon-\nstitutional, holding that it did not.  535 U.S. at 585. \nTwo years later, however, this Court affirmed a pre-\nliminary injunction barring enforcement of COPA on \nthe ground that the statute likely violated the First \nAmendment.  Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656 (2004) \n(Ashcroft II\u200a).  The Court described COPA as \u201ca content-\nbased speech restriction\u201d and subjected it to strict scru-\ntiny, asking whether it was \u201cthe least restrictive means \namong available, effective alternatives\u201d for advancing \nthe government\u2019s interest in restricting minors\u2019 access \nto harmful sexual content online.  Id. at 665-666.  Be-\ncause the Court concluded that the record suggested \nthat \u201cblocking and filtering software\u201d was a less restric-\ntive and potentially more effective alternative than the \nmeasures imposed by COPA, the Court held that the in-\njunction was not an abuse of discretion and remanded \nthe case for trial.  Id. at 666; see id. at 666-670.   \n\n4 \n \nIn so doing, the Court emphasized the preliminary \nnature of its analysis and noted that its decision did not \npreclude the government from satisfying strict scrutiny \non remand.  Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 672-673; see, e.g., \nid. at 664-665.  Nevertheless, the district court perma-\nnently enjoined COPA after a trial, see ACLU v. Gon-\nzales, 478 F. Supp. 2d 775, 809 (E.D. Pa. 2007), and the \nThird Circuit affirmed, see ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d \n181 (2008).  This Court denied the government\u2019s petition \nfor a writ of certiorari.  See Mukasey v. ACLU, 555 U.S. \n1137 (2009) (No. 08-565).  COPA has thus never been \nenforced. \n2. Beginning in 2022, many States enacted laws that, \nlike COPA, require publishers and distributors of sex-\nual content online to employ age-verification technol-\nogy.1  One of those States was Texas, which adopted \nsuch a law in 2023.  Texas\u2019s H.B. 1181 requires each \n \n1  See Ala. Code \u00a7 8-19G-1 et seq. (West 2024) (effective Oct. 1, \n2024); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-88-1301 et seq.

Sess. \nLaws, ch. 28, \u00a7 1 (effective July 1, 2024). \n\n5 \n \ncommercial entity that \u201cpublishes or distributes mate-\nrial on an Internet website  * * *  more than one-third \nof which is sexual material harmful to minors\u201d to \u201cuse \nreasonable age verification methods\u201d to confirm that us-\ners attempting to access that material are at least 18 years \nold.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.002(a) \n(West Supp. 2023).  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 defines \n\u201c[s]exual material harmful to minors\u201d using the Miller \nobscenity test adapted for minors.  Id. \u00a7 129B.001(6).  \nThe permitted \u201creasonable age verification methods\u201d \nare requiring users to \u201cprovide digital identification\u201d \n(i.e., \u201cinformation stored on a digital network that may \nbe accessed by a commercial entity and that serves as \nproof of the identity of an individual\u201d) or requiring us-\ners to \u201ccomply with a commercial age verification sys-\ntem\u201d that uses \u201cgovernment-issued identification\u201d or \u201ca \ncommercially reasonable method that relies on public or \nprivate transactional data to verify the age of an indi-\nvidual.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.003 (capitalization and emphasis \nomitted). \nH.B. 1181 forbids covered entities that perform the \nrequired age verification (or third parties that perform \nthat function) from \u201cretain[ing] any identifying infor-\nmation of the individual.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 129B.002(b) (West Supp. 2023).  It authorizes \ncivil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation of that  \nprohibition, and up to $10,000 per day for violations of \nthe age-verification requirement.  Id. \u00a7 129B.006(a)  \nand (b).  An entity whose violation of the age-verification \nrequirement results in a minor accessing harmful sexual \nmaterial faces a fine of up to $250,000.  Id. \u00a7 129.006(b)(3).  \nThe law exempts \u201cnews-gathering organization[s]\u201d and \n\u201cbona fide news or public interest broadcast[s],\u201d as well \nas \u201cInternet service provider[s],\u201d \u201csearch engine[s],\u201d \n\n6 \n \nand \u201ccloud service provider[s]\u201d insofar as they only \n\u201cprovid[e] access or connection to\u201d sexual content that \nis not under their control.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nIn a separate provision not at issue here, H.B. 1181 \nalso requires covered entities to display on their web-\nsites and in their advertisements certain notices about \nthe dangers posed by pornography.  See Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.004 (West Supp. 2023). \nB. Prior Proceedings \n1. Before H.B. 1181 took effect, petitioners\u2014most of \nthem commercial purveyors of pornography, led by an \nadult-industry trade association\u2014filed suit against the \nstate attorney general in the United States District \nCourt for the Western District of Texas.  As relevant \nhere, petitioners brought a facial challenge to H.B. 1181 \nunder the First Amendment and sought a preliminary \ninjunction.  After a hearing, the court granted the in-\njunction.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.   \nThe district court determined that petitioners were \nlikely to succeed on the merits.  Pet. App. 96a-136a.  The \ncourt first concluded that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovisions were subject to strict scrutiny, noting that \nthey were similar to COPA and that respondent had \n\u201clargely concede[d] that strict scrutiny applies\u201d under \nthis Court\u2019s precedents.  Id. at 108a; see id. at 107a-\n111a.  The district court held that the age-verification \nprovisions likely fail strict scrutiny because they are \nboth under- and overinclusive, as well as unclear.  For \nexample, the court faulted H.B. 1181 for exempting \nsearch engines, and effectively exempting social-media \nsites (because they do not contain \u201cat least one-third \nsexual material\u201d), even though many of them host sex-\nual content.  Id. at 113a; see id. at 112a-114a.  The court \nalso noted that \u201cmaterial that is patently offensive to \n\n7 \n \nyoung minors is not necessarily offensive to 17-year-\nolds,\u201d and it believed that H.B. 1181 \u201cprovide[d] no \nguidance,\u201d id. at 114a-115a, as to the relevant age for \nassessing whether material is \u201charmful to minors,\u201d Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.001(6) (West Supp. \n2023).  And because the law regulates material that is \nlegally obscene only as to children, the court explained, \nit covers \u201cvirtually all salacious material\u201d and burdens \naccess to \u201cmaterial that has cultural, scientific, or edu-\ncational value to adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a, 122a. \nThe district court further found that there was a less \nrestrictive means available to protect minors from sex-\nual content online\u2014namely content filtering, \u201cthe mod-\nern version of [the] \u2018blocking and filtering software\u2019\u200a\u201d \nthat this Court found promising in Ashcroft II.  Pet. \nApp. 128a (citing 542 U.S. at 666-673).  The district \ncourt highlighted what it perceived as several virtues of \nthat technology, such as its capacity to \u201cmore precisely \nscreen out sexual content\u201d than age verification and the \ngreater difficulty minors have in circumventing it.  Id. \nat 132a; see id. at 134a.   \nHaving found H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions \n\u201cconsiderably more intrusive while less effective than \nother alternatives,\u201d the district court concluded that \nthey \u201cd[id] not withstand strict scrutiny.\u201d  Pet. App. \n136a.  H.B. 1181\u2019s health-warnings provisions met the \nsame result after the court held that they compelled \nspeech in violation of the First Amendment.  Id. at 136a-\n150a.  The court found that petitioners also satisfied the \nremaining elements of the preliminary-injunction \nstandard and therefore enjoined H.B. 1181 in its en-\ntirety.  Id. at 155a-161a.   \n2. The court of appeals issued an administrative \nstay, and then a stay pending appeal, of the preliminary \n\n8 \n \ninjunction, permitting H.B. 1181 to be enforced during \nrespondent\u2019s appeal.  See Pet. App. 165a-168a.  A di-\nvided panel of the court of appeals ultimately vacated \nthe preliminary injunction in part and affirmed it in \npart.  Id. at 1a-87a. \na. The court of appeals held that the district court \nhad erred by applying strict scrutiny to H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification provisions.  Pet. App. 8a-26a.  The court of \nappeals relied on this Court\u2019s 1968 decision in Ginsberg, \nwhich applied rational-basis review to a state law crim-\ninalizing the sale of pornographic magazines to minors.  \nId. at 8a; see Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 641.  The court ac-\nknowledged that H.B. 1181 was \u201cvery similar\u201d to COPA, \nwhich this Court had subjected to strict scrutiny in Ash-\ncroft II.  Pet. App. 16a.  But the court of appeals rea-\nsoned that Ashcroft II had merely accepted the parties\u2019 \nagreement that strict scrutiny applied, and thus set no \nbinding precedent on the applicable level of scrutiny.  \nSee id. at 17a-19a. \nAlthough the court of appeals offered \u201cno opinion as \nto how [H.B. 1181] would fare under any other standard \nof review,\u201d it concluded that the law\u2019s age-verification \nprovisions \u201ceasily\u201d survive rational-basis scrutiny in \nlight of evidence establishing \u201cthe sort of damage that \naccess to pornography does to children.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a-\n27a.  The court therefore vacated the district court\u2019s in-\njunction as to those provisions.  Id. at 44a.  Agreeing \nwith the district court\u2019s analysis of the required health \nwarnings, however, the court of appeals affirmed the in-\njunction as to those provisions.  Id. at 27a-38a, 44a. \nb. Judge Higginbotham dissented from the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision on the age-verification provisions.  Pet. \nApp. 45a-87a.  He observed that this Court \u201chas un-\nswervingly applied strict scrutiny to content-based reg-\n\n9 \n \nulations that limit adults\u2019 access to protected speech.\u201d  \nId. at 54a; see id. at 58a-64a.  He distinguished Ginsberg \nbecause he believed that unlike H.B. 1181, the law at \nissue there did not \u201cburden the free speech interests of \nadults.\u201d  Id. at 56a.   \nJudge Higginbotham would have held that H.B. 1181 \n\u201cfails exacting scrutiny at this stage in large part for \nwant of evidence,\u201d concluding that the preliminary in-\njunction record was \u201cbereft of evidence responsive to \nthe burdens of strict scrutiny.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  But he \nemphasized that his conclusion applied only \u201c[a]t this \njunction and on this record,\u201d leaving open the possibil-\nity that respondent could provide the necessary evi-\ndence at trial.  Ibid.   \n3. In April 2024, several months after the court of \nappeals allowed Texas to begin enforcing H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification provisions, petitioners filed a petition \nfor a writ of certiorari and sought a stay of the court of \nappeals\u2019 judgment.  This Court denied the application \nfor stay, see 144 S. Ct. 1473 (No. 23A925), but later \ngranted certiorari. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nUnder Ashcroft II and this Court\u2019s other relevant \nprecedents, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions are \nsubject to strict scrutiny.  The court of appeals there-\nfore erred in applying only rational-basis review, and \nthis Court should follow its usual practice by vacating \nthe decision below and remanding to allow the court of \nappeals to apply the proper standard in the first in-\nstance.  In so doing, however, the Court should make \nclear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Con-\ngress and the States from adopting appropriately tai-\nlored measures to prevent children from accessing \nharmful sexual material on the Internet\u2014potentially in-\n\n10 \n \ncluding age-verification requirements analogous to \nthose that have long been applied to the distribution of \nsuch material in the physical world. \nA. The principle that content-based regulations of \nspeech are subject to strict scrutiny is a pillar of this \nCourt\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence.  Although \nthat principle includes an exception for obscenity and \nother historically unprotected categories of speech, the \nCourt has made clear that there is no exception for con-\ntent-based restrictions of sexually explicit or indecent \nspeech that does not sink to the level of obscenity. \nThis Court has also recognized that the government \nhas a compelling interest in shielding children from ex-\nposure to\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress has previ-\nously enacted laws with the same objective, including a \nstatute that the court of appeals described as \u201cvery sim-\nilar\u201d to the law at issue here.  Pet. App. 16a; see Ashcroft \nv. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 661-663 (2004).  Congress may \nlegislate in this area again.  Cf. Kids Online Safety and \nPrivacy Act, S. 2073, 118th Cong., 2d Sess. (as passed \nby the Senate, July 30, 2024).  The United States there-\nfore has a substantial interest in the development of the \napplicable First Amendment principles. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT  \nA. Legal And Factual Background \n1. This Court has long recognized that the govern-\nment has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in protecting minors \nfrom exposure to harmful sexual material, even mate-\nrial \u201cthat is not obscene by adult standards.\u201d  Sable \nCommc\u2019ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989); \nsee Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 640-641 (1968).  \nUntil the 1990s, shielding children from sexual content \nwas a matter of restricting their access to explicit mov-\nies, periodicals, and the like.  See, e.g., Erznoznik v. \nCity of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 206 (1975) (\u201cfilms \ncontaining nudity\u201d); Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 631 (porno-\ngraphic magazines).  But the advent of the Internet \nmade an unprecedented amount of \u201csexually explicit \nmaterial, including hardcore pornography,\u201d accessible \nto children with unprecedented ease.  Ashcroft v. \nACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 566-567 (2002) (Ashcroft I\u200a).  Con-\ngress and state legislatures have passed a variety of \nlaws in an attempt to address that problem. \nFor present purposes, the most relevant federal ef-\nfort was the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), 47 \nU.S.C. 231.  Enacted in 1998, COPA generally author-\nized criminal and civil penalties for anyone who used the \nInternet to \u201cmake[] any communication for commercial \npurposes that is available to any minor and that includes \nany material that is harmful to minors.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n231(a).  COPA included an affirmative defense for a de-\nfendant who, \u201cin good faith, has restricted access by mi-\nnors to material that is harmful to minors\u201d by \u201crequir-\ning use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, \nor adult personal identification number,\u201d \u201cby accepting \na digital certificate that verifies age,\u201d or \u201cby any other \n\n3 \n \nreasonable measures that are feasible under available \ntechnology.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 231(c)(1). \nCOPA defined \u201cmaterial that is harmful to minors\u201d \nas material \u201cthat is obscene\u201d or that would satisfy this \nCourt\u2019s test for obscenity if the test were adapted to a \nminor\u2019s perspective.  47 U.S.C. 231(e)(6); see Miller v. \nCalifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).  Thus, material would be \ncovered if, among other things, \u201cthe average person, ap-\nplying contemporary community standards, would find, \ntaking the material as a whole and with respect to mi-\nnors, [that it] is designed to appeal to, or is designed to \npander to, the prurient interest.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 231(e)(6)(A) \n(emphasis added); cf. Miller, 413 U.S. at 24.  In Ash-\ncroft I, this Court considered whether \u201cCOPA\u2019s reliance \non community standards to identify \u2018material that is \nharmful to minors\u2019\u200a\u201d rendered the statute facially uncon-\nstitutional, holding that it did not.  535 U.S. at 585. \nTwo years later, however, this Court affirmed a pre-\nliminary injunction barring enforcement of COPA on \nthe ground that the statute likely violated the First \nAmendment.  Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656 (2004) \n(Ashcroft II\u200a).  The Court described COPA as \u201ca content-\nbased speech restriction\u201d and subjected it to strict scru-\ntiny, asking whether it was \u201cthe least restrictive means \namong available, effective alternatives\u201d for advancing \nthe government\u2019s interest in restricting minors\u2019 access \nto harmful sexual content online.  Id. at 665-666.  Be-\ncause the Court concluded that the record suggested \nthat \u201cblocking and filtering software\u201d was a less restric-\ntive and potentially more effective alternative than the \nmeasures imposed by COPA, the Court held that the in-\njunction was not an abuse of discretion and remanded \nthe case for trial.  Id. at 666; see id. at 666-670.   \n\n4 \n \nIn so doing, the Court emphasized the preliminary \nnature of its analysis and noted that its decision did not \npreclude the government from satisfying strict scrutiny \non remand.  Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 672-673; see, e.g., \nid. at 664-665.  Nevertheless, the district court perma-\nnently enjoined COPA after a trial, see ACLU v. Gon-\nzales, 478 F. Supp. 2d 775, 809 (E.D. Pa. 2007), and the \nThird Circuit affirmed, see ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d \n181 (2008).  This Court denied the government\u2019s petition \nfor a writ of certiorari.  See Mukasey v. ACLU, 555 U.S. \n1137 (2009) (No. 08-565).  COPA has thus never been \nenforced. \n2. Beginning in 2022, many States enacted laws that, \nlike COPA, require publishers and distributors of sex-\nual content online to employ age-verification technol-\nogy.1  One of those States was Texas, which adopted \nsuch a law in 2023.  Texas\u2019s H.B. 1181 requires each \n \n1  See Ala. Code \u00a7 8-19G-1 et seq. (West 2024) (effective Oct. 1, \n2024); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-88-1301 et seq.

Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.002(a) \n(West Supp. 2023).  Like COPA, H.B. 1181 defines \n\u201c[s]exual material harmful to minors\u201d using the Miller \nobscenity test adapted for minors.  Id. \u00a7 129B.001(6).  \nThe permitted \u201creasonable age verification methods\u201d \nare requiring users to \u201cprovide digital identification\u201d \n(i.e., \u201cinformation stored on a digital network that may \nbe accessed by a commercial entity and that serves as \nproof of the identity of an individual\u201d) or requiring us-\ners to \u201ccomply with a commercial age verification sys-\ntem\u201d that uses \u201cgovernment-issued identification\u201d or \u201ca \ncommercially reasonable method that relies on public or \nprivate transactional data to verify the age of an indi-\nvidual.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 129B.003 (capitalization and emphasis \nomitted). \nH.B. 1181 forbids covered entities that perform the \nrequired age verification (or third parties that perform \nthat function) from \u201cretain[ing] any identifying infor-\nmation of the individual.\u201d  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 129B.002(b) (West Supp. 2023).  It authorizes \ncivil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation of that  \nprohibition, and up to $10,000 per day for violations of \nthe age-verification requirement.  Id. \u00a7 129B.006(a)  \nand (b).  An entity whose violation of the age-verification \nrequirement results in a minor accessing harmful sexual \nmaterial faces a fine of up to $250,000.  Id. \u00a7 129.006(b)(3).  \nThe law exempts \u201cnews-gathering organization[s]\u201d and \n\u201cbona fide news or public interest broadcast[s],\u201d as well \nas \u201cInternet service provider[s],\u201d \u201csearch engine[s],\u201d \n\n6 \n \nand \u201ccloud service provider[s]\u201d insofar as they only \n\u201cprovid[e] access or connection to\u201d sexual content that \nis not under their control.  Id. \u00a7 129B.005. \nIn a separate provision not at issue here, H.B. 1181 \nalso requires covered entities to display on their web-\nsites and in their advertisements certain notices about \nthe dangers posed by pornography.  See Tex. Civ. Prac. \n& Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.004 (West Supp. 2023). \nB. Prior Proceedings \n1. Before H.B. 1181 took effect, petitioners\u2014most of \nthem commercial purveyors of pornography, led by an \nadult-industry trade association\u2014filed suit against the \nstate attorney general in the United States District \nCourt for the Western District of Texas.  As relevant \nhere, petitioners brought a facial challenge to H.B. 1181 \nunder the First Amendment and sought a preliminary \ninjunction.  After a hearing, the court granted the in-\njunction.  Pet. App. 90a-161a.   \nThe district court determined that petitioners were \nlikely to succeed on the merits.  Pet. App. 96a-136a.  The \ncourt first concluded that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovisions were subject to strict scrutiny, noting that \nthey were similar to COPA and that respondent had \n\u201clargely concede[d] that strict scrutiny applies\u201d under \nthis Court\u2019s precedents.  Id. at 108a; see id. at 107a-\n111a.  The district court held that the age-verification \nprovisions likely fail strict scrutiny because they are \nboth under- and overinclusive, as well as unclear.  For \nexample, the court faulted H.B. 1181 for exempting \nsearch engines, and effectively exempting social-media \nsites (because they do not contain \u201cat least one-third \nsexual material\u201d), even though many of them host sex-\nual content.  Id. at 113a; see id. at 112a-114a.  The court \nalso noted that \u201cmaterial that is patently offensive to \n\n7 \n \nyoung minors is not necessarily offensive to 17-year-\nolds,\u201d and it believed that H.B. 1181 \u201cprovide[d] no \nguidance,\u201d id. at 114a-115a, as to the relevant age for \nassessing whether material is \u201charmful to minors,\u201d Tex. \nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.001(6) (West Supp. \n2023).  And because the law regulates material that is \nlegally obscene only as to children, the court explained, \nit covers \u201cvirtually all salacious material\u201d and burdens \naccess to \u201cmaterial that has cultural, scientific, or edu-\ncational value to adults.\u201d  Pet. App. 109a, 122a. \nThe district court further found that there was a less \nrestrictive means available to protect minors from sex-\nual content online\u2014namely content filtering, \u201cthe mod-\nern version of [the] \u2018blocking and filtering software\u2019\u200a\u201d \nthat this Court found promising in Ashcroft II.  Pet. \nApp. 128a (citing 542 U.S. at 666-673).  The district \ncourt highlighted what it perceived as several virtues of \nthat technology, such as its capacity to \u201cmore precisely \nscreen out sexual content\u201d than age verification and the \ngreater difficulty minors have in circumventing it.  Id. \nat 132a; see id. at 134a.   \nHaving found H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions \n\u201cconsiderably more intrusive while less effective than \nother alternatives,\u201d the district court concluded that \nthey \u201cd[id] not withstand strict scrutiny.\u201d  Pet. App. \n136a.  H.B. 1181\u2019s health-warnings provisions met the \nsame result after the court held that they compelled \nspeech in violation of the First Amendment.  Id. at 136a-\n150a.  The court found that petitioners also satisfied the \nremaining elements of the preliminary-injunction \nstandard and therefore enjoined H.B. 1181 in its en-\ntirety.  Id. at 155a-161a.   \n2. The court of appeals issued an administrative \nstay, and then a stay pending appeal, of the preliminary \n\n8 \n \ninjunction, permitting H.B. 1181 to be enforced during \nrespondent\u2019s appeal.  See Pet. App. 165a-168a.  A di-\nvided panel of the court of appeals ultimately vacated \nthe preliminary injunction in part and affirmed it in \npart.  Id. at 1a-87a. \na. The court of appeals held that the district court \nhad erred by applying strict scrutiny to H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification provisions.  Pet. App. 8a-26a.  The court of \nappeals relied on this Court\u2019s 1968 decision in Ginsberg, \nwhich applied rational-basis review to a state law crim-\ninalizing the sale of pornographic magazines to minors.  \nId. at 8a; see Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 641.  The court ac-\nknowledged that H.B. 1181 was \u201cvery similar\u201d to COPA, \nwhich this Court had subjected to strict scrutiny in Ash-\ncroft II.  Pet. App. 16a.  But the court of appeals rea-\nsoned that Ashcroft II had merely accepted the parties\u2019 \nagreement that strict scrutiny applied, and thus set no \nbinding precedent on the applicable level of scrutiny.  \nSee id. at 17a-19a. \nAlthough the court of appeals offered \u201cno opinion as \nto how [H.B. 1181] would fare under any other standard \nof review,\u201d it concluded that the law\u2019s age-verification \nprovisions \u201ceasily\u201d survive rational-basis scrutiny in \nlight of evidence establishing \u201cthe sort of damage that \naccess to pornography does to children.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a-\n27a.  The court therefore vacated the district court\u2019s in-\njunction as to those provisions.  Id. at 44a.  Agreeing \nwith the district court\u2019s analysis of the required health \nwarnings, however, the court of appeals affirmed the in-\njunction as to those provisions.  Id. at 27a-38a, 44a. \nb. Judge Higginbotham dissented from the court of \nappeals\u2019 decision on the age-verification provisions.  Pet. \nApp. 45a-87a.  He observed that this Court \u201chas un-\nswervingly applied strict scrutiny to content-based reg-\n\n9 \n \nulations that limit adults\u2019 access to protected speech.\u201d  \nId. at 54a; see id. at 58a-64a.  He distinguished Ginsberg \nbecause he believed that unlike H.B. 1181, the law at \nissue there did not \u201cburden the free speech interests of \nadults.\u201d  Id. at 56a.   \nJudge Higginbotham would have held that H.B. 1181 \n\u201cfails exacting scrutiny at this stage in large part for \nwant of evidence,\u201d concluding that the preliminary in-\njunction record was \u201cbereft of evidence responsive to \nthe burdens of strict scrutiny.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  But he \nemphasized that his conclusion applied only \u201c[a]t this \njunction and on this record,\u201d leaving open the possibil-\nity that respondent could provide the necessary evi-\ndence at trial.  Ibid.   \n3. In April 2024, several months after the court of \nappeals allowed Texas to begin enforcing H.B. 1181\u2019s \nage-verification provisions, petitioners filed a petition \nfor a writ of certiorari and sought a stay of the court of \nappeals\u2019 judgment.  This Court denied the application \nfor stay, see 144 S. Ct. 1473 (No. 23A925), but later \ngranted certiorari. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nUnder Ashcroft II and this Court\u2019s other relevant \nprecedents, H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions are \nsubject to strict scrutiny.  The court of appeals there-\nfore erred in applying only rational-basis review, and \nthis Court should follow its usual practice by vacating \nthe decision below and remanding to allow the court of \nappeals to apply the proper standard in the first in-\nstance.  In so doing, however, the Court should make \nclear that the First Amendment does not prohibit Con-\ngress and the States from adopting appropriately tai-\nlored measures to prevent children from accessing \nharmful sexual material on the Internet\u2014potentially in-\n\n10 \n \ncluding age-verification requirements analogous to \nthose that have long been applied to the distribution of \nsuch material in the physical world. \nA. The principle that content-based regulations of \nspeech are subject to strict scrutiny is a pillar of this \nCourt\u2019s First Amendment jurisprudence.  Although \nthat principle includes an exception for obscenity and \nother historically unprotected categories of speech, the \nCourt has made clear that there is no exception for con-\ntent-based restrictions of sexually explicit or indecent \nspeech that does not sink to the level of obscenity. \nThis Court has also recognized that the government \nhas a compelling interest in shielding children from ex-\nposure to harmful sexual material, even if that material \nis not obscene as to adults.  Consistent with the Court\u2019s \ngeneral approach to content-based regulations, how-\never, it has repeatedly held that content-based laws \naimed at achieving that important goal must be sub-\njected to strict scrutiny to ensure that they do not un-\nnecessarily burden adults\u2019 access to protected speech.  \nIn Ashcroft II, for example, the Court addressed a fed-\neral law \u201cvery similar\u201d to H.B. 1181, Pet. App. 16a, and \napplied strict scrutiny even though the material covered \nby the law was obscene as to minors and thus constitu-\ntionally unprotected as to them under Ginsberg v. New \nYork, 390 U.S. 629 (1968). \nB. The court of appeals\u2019 holding that H.B. 1181 is \nsubject only to rational-basis review contradicts those \nestablished First Amendment principles and prece-\ndents.  It is undisputed that H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification \nprovisions impose a content-based restriction on speech \nthat is obscene for children but constitutionally pro-\ntected for adults.  Ashcroft II makes particularly clear \nthat such a law is subject to strict scrutiny, and the \n\n11 \n \ncourt of appeals erred in declining to follow this Court\u2019s \ndecision on the dubious theory that the Court merely \nassumed without deciding that strict scrutiny applied.  \nThe court of appeals likewise erred in concluding that \nGinsberg supported its application of rational-basis re-\nview.  That decision focused on the First Amendment \nrights of minors; it did not address the standard that \ngoverns a challenge grounded in the burdens a content-\nbased law imposes on adults\u2019 access to material that is \nconstitutionally protected as to them.  That is the ques-\ntion presented here, and it is answered by Ashcroft II \nand this Court\u2019s other precedents applying strict scru-\ntiny to analogous challenges.   \nC. Petitioners urge this Court not only to correct the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 error about the appropriate standard \nof review, but also to hold that H.B. 1181 likely fails \nstrict scrutiny.  But this Court is a court of review, not \nof first view, and it should adhere to its usual practice \nby remanding to allow the court of appeals to apply the \nproper standard in the first instance.  In so doing, the \nCourt should make clear that strict scrutiny does not \nforeclose Congress or the States from restricting the \ndistribution of harmful sexual material to children \nonline, just as legislatures have traditionally restricted \nthe distribution of such material in the physical world.   \nWith the mass proliferation of online pornography \nand Internet-enabled devices, the compelling interest of \nfederal, state, and local governments in protecting chil-\ndren from harmful sexual material is more pressing \nthan ever before.  Appropriately tailored age-verifica-\ntion laws and regulations may be a necessary element \nof governmental efforts to accomplish that compelling \nobjective, and thus may be permissible under the appli-\ncable First Amendment standards.  We take no position \n\n12 \n \non whether H.B. 1181 or any other specific law or pro-\nposal satisfies strict scrutiny.  But the Court should not \nadopt petitioners\u2019 view of that standard, which would \nthreaten to foreclose effective regulation addressing an \nimportant problem that has only become more urgent \nin the years since the Court last considered it. \nARGUMENT  \nTexas enacted H.B. 1181 to serve a governmental in-\nterest of great importance:  protecting children from \nexposure to harmful sexual material on the Internet.  \nBut H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions pursue that \naim by drawing content-based lines and burdening \nspeech that is constitutionally protected for adults, even \nthough not for children.  This Court\u2019s decisions estab-\nlish that such a law is subject to strict scrutiny, and the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding otherwise.  In correct-\ning that error, however, the Court should make clear \nthat strict scrutiny does not prevent Congress or the \nStates from adopting effective and appropriately tai-\nlored measures to restrict the distribution of harmful \nsexual material to minors. \nA. Content-Based Regulations Of Protected Speech Are \nSubject To Strict Scrutiny \n1. Under the First Amendment, governments gen-\nerally \u201chave no power to restrict expression because of \nits message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u201d  \nNational Inst. of Family & Life Advocates v. Becerra, \n585 U.S. 755, 766 (2018) (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Content-based regulations of speech \nare subject to strict scrutiny, meaning they \u201cmay be jus-\ntified only if the government proves that they are nar-\nrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.\u201d  \nIbid. (quoting Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2015)).  That principle encompasses not only regula-\n\n13 \n \ntions that flatly prohibit speech, but also content-based \n\u201cregulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose dif-\nferential burdens upon speech.\u201d  Turner Broad. Sys., \nInc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642 (1994).  \u201cThe distinction \nbetween laws burdening and laws banning speech is but \na matter of degree.\u201d  United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t \nGrp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 812 (2000). \n\u201cThere are of course exceptions\u201d to the general rule \nthat content-based burdens trigger strict scrutiny.  \nBrown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass\u2019n, 564 U.S. \n786, 791 (2011).  In a \u201cfew limited areas,\u201d the \u201cpreven-\ntion and punishment\u201d of speech based on its content \n\u201chas never been thought to raise any constitutional \nproblem\u201d because the speech is not protected by the \nFirst Amendment at all.  United States v. Stevens, 559 \nU.S. 460, 468-469 (2010) (citations and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Those traditionally unprotected \ncategories of speech include \u201cincitement,\u201d \u201cfighting \nwords,\u201d and\u2014most relevant here\u2014\u201cobscenity.\u201d  Enter-\ntainment Merchants, 564 U.S. at 791; see Miller v. Cal-\nifornia, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (setting forth the constitu-\ntional standard for obscenity).  And as this Court held \nin Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), speech \ncan be obscene as to children, and thus constitutionally \nunprotected as to them, even if it is not obscene for \nadults.  Id. at 637. \nThere is no general First Amendment exception, \nhowever, for sexually explicit or indecent expression \nthat does not qualify as obscene as to adults.  To the \ncontrary, the Court has repeatedly held that \u201c[s]exual \nexpression which is indecent but not obscene is pro-\ntected by the First Amendment.\u201d  Sable Commc\u2019ns of \nCal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  And although \npreventing minors from accessing material that is ob-\n\n14 \n \nscene as to them is a laudable and even compelling goal, \nthat does not change the constitutional standard.  \n\u201c[B]enign motivation  * * *  is not enough to avoid the \nneed for strict scrutiny of content-based [regulations].\u201d  \nTurner Broad., 512 U.S. at 677 (O\u2019Connor, J., concur-\nring in part and dissenting in part). \n2. This Court has accordingly applied strict scrutiny \nto laws that restrict the dissemination of sexual content \nthat is not obscene as to adults even if it was enacted \nwith the objective of protecting children.  In Sable, for \nexample, the Court applied strict scrutiny to a law that \nsought to \u201crestrict the access of minors to dial-a-porn\u201d \nby banning \u201cindecent [or] obscene interstate commer-\ncial telephone messages.\u201d  492 U.S. at 117, 118, 120; see \nid. at 126; id. at 133 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part).  In Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 \n(1997), the Court applied strict scrutiny to a law prohib-\niting the transmission of \u201cobscene or indecent\u201d mes-\nsages or the display of \u201cpatently offensive\u201d messages to \nminors via the Internet, subject to an affirmative de-\nfense for distributors that employed age-verification \nmeasures.  Id. at 859-860; see id. at 879, 882.  And in \nPlayboy, the Court assessed a law \u201crequir[ing] cable \ntelevision operators who provide channels \u2018primarily \ndedicated to sexually-oriented programming\u2019 either to \n\u2018fully scramble or otherwise fully block\u2019 those channels \nor to limit their transmission to hours when children are \nunlikely to be viewing.\u201d  529 U.S. at 806 (citation omit-\nted).  On \u201cwhat standard the Government must meet\u201d \nfor the law to pass constitutional muster, the Court was \nemphatic:  \u201cThe standard is strict scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 814. \n3. In light of those well-established precedents, the \ngovernment acknowledged in Ashcroft II that the Child \nOnline Protection Act was subject to strict scrutiny.  \n\n15 \n \nSpecifically, the government explained that \u201cbecause \n[the statute] regulates on the basis of content, COPA \n\u2018must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling gov-\nernment interest\u2019 in order to be constitutional under the \nFirst Amendment.\u201d  U.S. Br. at 18, Ashcroft v. ACLU, \n542 U.S. 656 (2004) (No. 03-218) (quoting Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 813).  The government defended COPA by argu-\ning that Congress \u201chas a compelling interest in shield-\ning minors from the harmful effects of pornography on \nthe Web\u201d and that \u201cCOPA is narrowly tailored to that \ninterest.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 18-44. \nThis Court applied the same standard.  It began by \nexplaining that COPA was a successor to the statute the \nCourt had held invalid in Reno, and that like its prede-\ncessor COPA was a \u201ccontent-based restriction[] on \nspeech.\u201d  Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 660; see also, e.g., id. \nat 670 (\u201cPlayboy Entertainment Group, like this case, \ninvolved a content-based restriction designed to protect \nminors from viewing harmful materials.\u201d).  The Court \nemphasized that \u201c[w]hen plaintiffs challenge a content-\nbased speech restriction, the burden is on the Govern-\nment to prove that the proposed alternatives will not be \nas effective as the challenged statute.\u201d  Id. at 665.  The \nCourt declined to disturb the preliminary injunction be-\ncause it determined that there were likely \u201cplausible, less \nrestrictive alternatives to COPA.\u201d  Ibid.  And although \nthe Court emphasized that COPA might ultimately be \ndeemed constitutional on remand, the Court made clear \nthat the statute would survive only if it was \u201cthe least \nrestrictive alternative to accomplish Congress\u2019s goal.\u201d  \nId. at 673.  The Court\u2019s opinion, in short, was built \n\n16 \n \naround the understanding that COPA was subject to \nstrict scrutiny.2  \nJustice Breyer, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist \nand Justice O\u2019Connor, disagreed with the Court\u2019s con-\nclusion that COPA was not narrowly tailored but ex-\npressly agreed that strict scrutiny applied.  \u201cLike the \nCourt,\u201d Justice Breyer wrote, \u201cI would subject the Act to \n\u2018the most exacting scrutiny,\u2019 requiring the Government to \nshow that any restriction of nonobscene expression is \n\u2018narrowly drawn\u2019 to further a \u2018compelling interest\u2019 and \nthat the restriction amounts to the \u2018least restrictive \nmeans\u2019 available to further that interest.\u201d  Ashcroft II, \n542 U.S. at 677 (citations omitted).  Justice Scalia alone \ncontended that strict scrutiny was inappropriate on the \ntheory that \u201ccommercial pornography\u201d has no First \nAmendment protection at all, even as to adults.  Id. at \n676 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing, e.g., Playboy, 529 \nU.S. at 831 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  \nB. H.B. 1181 Is A Content-Based Regulation Subject To \nStrict Scrutiny \nLike COPA, H.B. 1181 imposes a content-based re-\nstriction on speech that is constitutionally protected as \nto adults in order to protect children from harmful sex-\nual material on the Internet.  That is a compelling gov-\nernment interest that is highly relevant in determining \nwhether H.B. 1181 survives strict scrutiny.  But the \ncourt of appeals erred in treating it as a basis for dis-\n \n2  The Court\u2019s application of strict scrutiny in Ashcroft II was also \nconsistent with its opinion in Ashcroft I.  There, the Court reserved \njudgment on several issues related to COPA\u2019s constitutionality, in-\ncluding whether the statute would \u201csurvive strict scrutiny\u201d\u2014but not \non whether strict scrutiny applied at all.  Ashcroft v. ACLU, 535 U.S. \n564, 585-586 (2002). \n\n17 \n \npensing with heightened First Amendment scrutiny al-\ntogether. \n1. Like COPA, H.B. 1181 is a content-based restriction \nsubject to strict scrutiny  \na. H.B. 1181\u2019s age-verification provisions require a \nwebsite operator to conduct age verification if \u201cmore \nthan one-third\u201d of the site consists of sexual content that \nis obscene as to minors.  Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 129B.002(a) (West Supp. 2023).  That requirement is \ncontent based under this Court\u2019s precedents because it \n\u201ctargets speech based on its communicative content.\u201d  \nCity of Austin v. Reagan Nat\u2019l Advertising of Austin, \nLLC, 596 U.S. 61, 69 (2022) (citation omitted).  In Play-\nboy, for example, the Court held that a statute directed \nat \u201csexually explicit adult programming\u201d because of its \nharmful effects on children reflected \u201cthe essence of \ncontent-based regulation.\u201d  529 U.S. at 811-812 (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).   \nH.B. 1181 also includes within its sweep a substantial \namount of speech protected by the First Amendment. \nMaterial that is obscene for minors can be constitution-\nally protected for adults, see Sable, 492 U.S. at 126, and \nup to two-thirds of a covered website may be material \nprotected even as to children, see Tex. Civ. Prac. & \nRem. Code Ann. \u00a7 129B.002(a) (West Supp. 2023).  De-\nspite respondent\u2019s focus on the most extreme forms of \nonline pornography, see, e.g., Br. in Opp. 3-5, it is undis-\nputed that H.B. 1181 extends more broadly to indecent \nmaterial that is protected as to adults.  The statute thus \ncannot be justified as a regulation of obscenity that has \nno First Amendment protection at all.   \nBecause H.B. 1181 is a content-based regulation of \nspeech that is constitutionally protected as to adults, a \nlong line of this Court\u2019s precedents makes clear that it \n\n18 \n \nis subject to strict scrutiny\u2014even though it seeks to \npromote the government\u2019s compelling interest in pro-\ntecting children from harmful sexual material.  See pp. \n12-16, supra.  The Court\u2019s application of strict scrutiny \nto COPA in Ashcroft II makes that conclusion particu-\nlarly clear.  As the court of appeals recognized, \u201cH.B. \n1181 is very similar to COPA,\u201d Pet. App. 16a, from its \nMiller-derived definition of harmful sexual content to \nits reliance on age-verification technology to shield chil-\ndren from that material.  See id. at 4a (H.B. 1181 \u201cmim-\nics [COPA\u2019s] language\u201d); pp. 2-6, supra.   \nb. The court of appeals nonetheless asserted that it \nwas not bound by Ashcroft II\u2019s application of strict scru-\ntiny, asserting that this Court had merely assumed \nwithout deciding that strict scrutiny applied based on \nthe parties\u2019 agreement on the relevant standard.  See \nPet. App. 17a-19a.  That account contradicts both this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Ashcroft II and the precedents on \nwhich the Court relied.3   \nAlthough this Court sometimes merely assumes the \nvalidity of a legal proposition without deciding it, that is \nnot what the Court did in Ashcroft II.  To the contrary, \nthe Court concluded that COPA was a \u201ccontent-based \n \n3  The court of appeals also noted that \u201cCOPA was criminal\u201d \nwhereas \u201cH.B. 1181 is civil\u201d and that \u201cCOPA allowed age-verification \nas an affirmative defense, yet H.B. 1181 requires it upfront.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 16a.  While those distinctions may be relevant in determining \nwhether the law survives strict scrutiny, the court did not suggest \nthat they affected the level of First Amendment scrutiny that ap-\nplies as a threshold matter.  Under this Court\u2019s precedents, the ap-\nplicable standard turns on whether a law is a content-based regula-\ntion of protected speech\u2014not whether it is civil or criminal, or on \nthe procedural mechanisms by which it is enforced.  See, e.g., En-\ntertainment Merchants, 564 U.S. at 789, 799-804 (applying strict \nscrutiny to a civil prohibition). \n\n19 \n \nrestriction\u201d of speech subject to strict scrutiny under \nPlayboy, Reno, and the Court\u2019s other established prec-\nedents.  Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 670; see id. at 660, 665.  \nThat the Court did not belabor the level of scrutiny does \nnot mean that it failed to consider the point; instead, it \nsuggests only that the Court, like the government, un-\nderstood the applicable standard of scrutiny to be set-\ntled by recent precedent.  See p. 14, supra (discussing \nSable, Reno, and Playboy).  And it is particularly im-\nplausible to maintain that this Court merely assumed \nwithout deciding that strict scrutiny applied because \nJustice Scalia specifically argued for a different ap-\nproach in his dissent, relying on his earlier dissent in \nPlayboy.  See Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 676. \nUntil the decision below, courts of appeals assessing \nthe constitutionality of state laws similar to COPA and \nH.B. 1181 had uniformly concluded that this Court\u2019s \nprecedents required strict scrutiny.  See PSINet, Inc. \nv. Chapman, 362 F.3d 227, 233 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing \nPlayboy); American Booksellers Found. v. Dean, 342 \nF.3d 96, 101-102 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Reno); ACLU v. \nJohnson, 194 F.3d 1149, 1156 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing Sa-\nble and Reno); see also ACLU v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181, \n190 (3d Cir. 2008) (applying strict scrutiny to COPA af-\nter remand in Ashcroft II), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1137 \n(2009).  Those courts correctly identified the applicable \nstandard of review. \n2. The court of appeals erred in holding that Ginsberg \njustified the application of rational-basis review  \nThe court of appeals did not dispute that H.B. 1181 \nis \u201ccontent-based.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 19a.  It also \ndid not deny that the law reaches a substantial amount \nof speech that is constitutionally protected as to adults.  \nBut the court nonetheless broke from its sister circuits \n\n20 \n \nand applied rational-basis review to H.B. 1181\u2019s age-\nverification provisions based on this Court\u2019s decision in \nGinsberg.  Id. at 8a-26a.  Ginsberg cannot bear the \nweight the court of appeals placed upon it\u2014and it cer-\ntainly does not justify the court of appeals\u2019 departure \nfrom Ashcroft II and this Court\u2019s other more recent \nprecedents applying strict scrutiny. \na. In Ginsberg, a shopkeeper was convicted of vio-\nlating a state law prohibiting \u201cthe sale to minors under \n17 years of age\u201d of magazines \u201cdefined to be obscene\u201d \nas to minors.  390 U.S. at 631.  Although Ginsberg \nmounted a \u201cbroad challenge\u201d to the statute, Pet. App. \n12a n.18, the Court understood that challenge to rest on \na putative right of minors \u201cto read or see material con-\ncerned with sex,\u201d not on the right of adults to access \nsuch material.  390 U.S. at 636.  The Court rejected that \nclaim, holding that children have no constitutional right \nto buy, and adults have no right to sell to children, sex-\nual material that is obscene as to children.  Id. at 636-\n637.  The Court framed its holding in those terms, ex-\nplaining that it could not \u201csay that the statute invades \nthe area of freedom of expression constitutionally se-\ncured to minors.\u201d  Id. at 637.  The Court thus concluded \nthat the State could prohibit minors from accessing the \ncovered material so long as \u201cit was not irrational for the \nlegislature to find that exposure to material condemned \nby the statue is harmful to minors.\u201d  Id. at 641. \nThe court of appeals was correct to say that Ginsberg \n\u201cmust stand for something.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But as \nGinsberg itself makes clear, the decision stands for the \nprinciple that minors have no constitutional right to ac-\ncess material that is obscene as to them.  Minors could \nnot, for example, challenge H.B. 1181 on the theory that \nit prohibits them from viewing material that is obscene \n\n21 \n \nfor minors, and petitioners could not challenge H.B. \n1181 on the theory that it prohibits them from distrib-\nuting such material to minors.  Those claims are fore-\nclosed because, as to minors, such material is outside \nthe First Amendment altogether:  Insofar as minors are \nconcerned, it falls within one of the \u201cwell-defined and \nnarrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and \npunishment of which has never been thought to raise \nany constitutional problem.\u201d  Stevens, 559 U.S. at 468-\n469 (citation omitted). \nThat is not, however, the nature of the claim that pe-\ntitioners have brought here.  Instead, like the plaintiffs \nin Sable, Reno, Playboy, and Ashcroft II, they contend \nthat a law that is aimed at protecting minors from harm-\nful sexual content violates the First Amendment be-\ncause it restricts petitioners\u2019 ability to distribute to \nadults material that is not obscene as to them (and re-\nstricts adults\u2019 corresponding right to receive that mate-\nrial).  Ginsberg had no occasion to address the appro-\npriate standard of scrutiny for such a challenge. \nb. The court of appeals failed to justify its contrary \nreading of Ginsberg.  The court emphasized, for exam-\nple, this Court\u2019s references to Ginsberg in Erznoznik v. \nCity of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975), and Enter-\ntainment Merchants, supra.  Pet. App. 9a-10a.  But \nthose decisions simply acknowledge the vitality of Gins-\nberg\u2019s holding that speech that is obscene for children is \nconstitutionally unprotected as to children.  Erznoznik, \nwhich invalidated a city ordinance banning drive-in the-\naters from showing films containing nudity, cited Gins-\nberg in disapproving the ordinance for covering content \nthat \u201ccannot be deemed obscene even as to minors.\u201d  422 \nU.S. at 212-213.  And Entertainment Merchants de-\nclined to extend Ginsberg to a state law deeming certain \n\n22 \n \nvideo games unsuitable for children based on violent, \nnot sexual, content.  564 U.S. at 793-794. \nThe court of appeals also suggested that Ginsberg \nengaged in a more complete analysis of \u201cthe appropri-\nate level of scrutiny\u201d than Ashcroft II.  Pet. App. 12a \nn.18.  It is true that Ginsberg explained that rational-\nbasis review applied to the challenge in that case be-\ncause the relevant material was constitutionally unpro-\ntected as to children.  But the Court\u2019s decision cannot \nplausibly be read as \u201ccarv[ing] out an exception to \nheightened scrutiny of content-based speech regula-\ntions\u201d for material that is protected as to adults.  Id. at \n22a.  To the contrary, Ginsberg was decided at a time \nwhen this Court\u2019s modern framework of First Amend-\nment scrutiny was just emerging.  See Americans for \nProsperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 622 (2021) \n(Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judg-\nment).  In Ashcroft II, by contrast, this Court\u2019s applica-\ntion of strict scrutiny followed from a well-established \nline of precedent. \nNor did the court of appeals justify its elevation of \nGinsberg over those more recent and more pertinent \nprecedents.  The court identified several distinctions \nbetween H.B. 1181 and the law invalidated in Reno, \nwhich, for example, \u201cincluded prohibitions on non-sexual \nmaterial\u201d in the form of \u201c\u200a\u2018excretory activities.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a & n.19 (quoting Reno, 521 U.S. at 846).  \nBut the court did not explain why those differences af-\nfected the level of judicial scrutiny as opposed to the \nlaws\u2019 relative chances of satisfying it.  The court distin-\nguished Sable as involving \u201can outright ban\u201d on pro-\ntected speech, id. at 16a (citation omitted), even though \ncontent-based bans and burdens alike trigger strict \nscrutiny, see p. 13, supra.  As for Playboy, the court \n\n23 \n \nemphasized that the law in that case restricted even \nadults\u2019 access to sexual programming, whereas \u201cH.B. \n1181 allows adults to access as much pornography as \nthey want whenever they want.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  But \nH.B. 1181 undeniably imposes a content-based burden \non adults\u2019 access to protected speech by requiring that \ncovered websites verify that they are adults.  The de-\ngree of that burden and the ease with which it can be \nsatisfied are important considerations in determining \nwhether H.B. 1181 satisfies strict scrutiny\u2014but the \ncourt of appeals failed to explain why those considera-\ntions justify a novel exception to the established rule \nthat content-based burdens on protected speech are \nsubject to strict scrutiny. \nC. This Court Should Remand For The Application Of \nStrict Scrutiny While Making Clear That The First \nAmendment Does Not Necessarily Foreclose Appropri-\nately Tailored Age-Verification Laws  \nBecause the court of appeals erroneously concluded \nthat H.B. 1181 was subject only to rational-basis review, \nit specifically declined to consider \u201chow [the law] would \nfare under any other standard of review.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a.  Petitioners contend (Br. 37-43) that this Court \nshould apply strict scrutiny and hold that H.B. 1181 is \nlikely unconstitutional.  But because this Court is \u201ca \ncourt of review, not of first view,\u201d its typical practice in \nthis situation is to vacate the decision below and remand \nto allow the court of appeals to apply the correct legal \nstandard.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. 2383, \n2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  The Court should adhere \nto that usual practice here.  The question on which this \nCourt granted certiorari included only the applicable \nstandard of review, not its application to H.B. 1181.  Pet. \ni; see Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a).  As the Court emphasized in \n\n24 \n \nAshcroft II, the application of strict scrutiny to a law \nlike H.B. 1181 requires a fact- and record-intensive \nanalysis of the current state of age-verification technol-\nogy, as well as potential alternatives.  542 U.S. at 671-\n673.  And deferring this Court\u2019s consideration of the \nquestion how strict scrutiny applies to a law like H.B. \n1181 would also allow the Court to benefit from the \nlower courts\u2019 analysis of First Amendment challenges \nto the many similar laws that have been adopted in \nother States.  See p. 4 n.1, supra. \nIn remanding for the application of strict scrutiny, \nhowever, the Court should make clear that the First \nAmendment does not foreclose appropriately tailored \nmeasures to restrict the distribution of harmful sexual \nmaterial to children on the Internet\u2014potentially in-\ncluding age-verification measures.  This Court took care \nto note in Ashcroft II that its \u201copinion does not hold that \nCongress is incapable of enacting any regulation of the \nInternet designed to prevent minors from gaining ac-\ncess to harmful materials,\u201d nor did it foreclose a deter-\nmination that an age-verification law like COPA itself \ncould satisfy strict scrutiny.  542 U.S. at 672-673.  In this \ncase, the Court should likewise clarify that its prelimi-\nnary analysis of COPA in 2004 does not foreclose Con-\ngress or the States from adopting age-verification \nmeasures in light of two decades of technological devel-\nopments and additional experience with the serious \nproblem of children accessing harmful sexual material \nonline. \n1. Strict scrutiny affords legislatures some flexibility \nin restricting access to sexual content online \nThis Court has recognized that \u201c[s]trict scrutiny is \nnot \u2018strict in theory, but fatal in fact.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Johnson v. Cal-\nifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 514 (2005) (citation omitted).  In \n\n25 \n \nthe context of a law aimed at furthering the govern-\nment\u2019s compelling interest in \u201cprotecting children from \nharmful materials,\u201d the purpose of strict scrutiny is to \nensure that the law does not result in  \u201cunnecessarily \nbroad suppression of speech addressed to adults,\u201d \nReno, 521 U.S. at 875 (emphasis added)\u2014not to fore-\nclose laws that impose any burden on adults.  The ap-\nplication of strict scrutiny in this context should be \nguided by the urgency of the government\u2019s interest in \nprotecting children, the special challenges of regulating \nin the Internet context, and the established tradition of \nrequiring age verification for the distribution of similar \nmaterial in the physical world.   \na. \u201c[T]he need to protect children from exposure to \npatently offensive sex-related material\u201d is \u201can ex-\ntremely important justification, one that th[e] Court has \noften found compelling.\u201d  Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. \nConsortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 743 (1996) (plu-\nrality opinion); see p. 2, supra.  The importance of that \ninterest has only increased over time.  When this Court \nconsidered COPA, for example, high-speed Internet, \nsocial media, and smartphones were all in their infancy; \nthe Court was thus focused on minors who accessed the \nInternet on computers \u201cin homes, schools, and librar-\nies.\u201d  Ashcroft I, 535 U.S. at 567; see Br. in Opp. 15-16.   \nToday, in contrast, many children have their own \nsmartphones or other Internet-enabled devices and \nspend hours online every day.  See Kids Online Health \n& Safety Task Force, Online Health and Safety for \nChildren and Youth:  Best Practices for Families and \nGuidance for Industry 12 (July 2024) (noting over half \nof teenagers spend four or more hours a day on social \nmedia alone), https://tinyurl.com/4kbua4fc.  And as the \nSurgeon General has warned, \u201c[e]xtreme, inappropri-\n\n26 \n \nate, and harmful content\u201d is now \u201ceasily and widely ac-\ncessible by children and adolescents\u201d online.  U.S. Sur-\ngeon Gen.\u2019s Advisory, Social Media and Youth Mental \nHealth 8 (2023), https://tinyurl.com/yrzznept; see id. at \n13 (\u201cNearly 70% of parents say parenting is now more \ndifficult than it was 20 years ago, with technology and \nsocial media as the top two cited reasons.\u201d). \nb. Although \u201c\u200a\u2018the basic principles\u2019 of the First \nAmendment \u2018do not vary\u2019\u200a\u201d when applied to \u201c\u200a\u2018ever- \nadvancing technology,\u2019\u200a\u201d NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. at 2403 \n(citation omitted), the First Amendment does not bar \nconsideration of the extraordinary regulatory chal-\nlenges presented by the Internet\u2014a sprawling and \ncomplex environment that \u201cevolves at a rapid pace,\u201d \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 671; see NetChoice, 144 S. Ct. \nat 2398 (\u201cThe online world is variegated and complex, \nencompassing an ever-growing number of apps, ser-\nvices, functionalities, and methods for communication \nand connection.\u201d).  To the contrary, strict scrutiny by \ndefinition demands a context-sensitive inquiry into the \neffectiveness of the challenged regulation and whether \n\u201cless restrictive alternatives would be at least as effec-\ntive in achieving\u201d the relevant government interest.  \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 665. \nStrict scrutiny cannot properly be applied without \nattention to the \u201cunique problems\u201d presented by the \nrelevant mode of expression.  Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813 \n(there, cable television).  Given how the Internet works, \nfor example, it is difficult to imagine any effective \nmeans of restricting children\u2019s access to obscene or in-\ndecent material online that would not affect at least \nsome measure of innocuous material.  See, e.g., Ashcroft \nII, 542 U.S. at 668 (noting that content-filtering soft-\nware \u201cmay block some materials that are not harmful to \n\n27 \n \nminors\u201d).  In addition, the realities of the Internet mean \nthat \u201cany attempt to identify the user\u201d of a website as a \nchild \u201cwill implicate adults in some way.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  \nBut the mere fact that a law prohibiting children from \naccessing material that is obscene as to them imposes a \ncorollary burden on adults by requiring them to estab-\nlish that they are adults should not necessarily be dis-\nqualifying.  To the contrary, as Judge Higginbotham \nemphasized, a State has the right and the obligation \u201cto \nprotect its minors, and in doing so, it must have the \nmeans to frustrate their access to pornographic materi-\nals consistent with the First Amendment.\u201d  Id. at 85a-\n86a. \nc. Traditional regulations that apply in the physical \nworld underscore that principle and should likewise in-\nform the First Amendment analysis of age-verification \nlaws on the Internet.  \u201cStates have long denied minors \naccess to certain establishments frequented by adults,\u201d \nsuch as places of \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d  Reno, 521 U.S. \nat 887 & n.1 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment \nin part and dissenting in part) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  And as Ginsberg illustrates, \nStates have also long \u201cdenied minors access to speech \ndeemed to be \u2018harmful to minors.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 887; see id. at \n887 n.2 (collecting dozens of examples). \nThose content-based laws necessarily impose some \nburden on adults.  Adults who seek to enter adult thea-\nters or buy pornographic magazines are often required \nto show a driver\u2019s license or otherwise verify their age\u2014\na requirement that may deter some adults from access-\ning speech that is protected as to them and that may \npose particular obstacles for people who do not have a \ngovernment-issued identification.  But those burdens do \nnot mean that traditional and ubiquitous age-verification \n\n28 \n \nrequirements in the physical world flunk strict scrutiny; \ninstead, they are the least restrictive means of further-\ning the government\u2019s compelling interest in preventing \nminors from accessing harmful sexual material.4 \nTo be sure, the process of age verification on the In-\nternet is more complicated\u2014and, depending on the \ntechnology, may be more burdensome\u2014than the pro-\ncess by which \u201ca bouncer checks a person\u2019s driver\u2019s li-\ncense before admitting him to a nightclub.\u201d  Reno, 521 \nU.S. at 890 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in \n \n4  Petitioners assert that laws like the one upheld in Ginsberg do \nnot \u201cburden[] the speech rights of adults\u201d because they bar only \n\u201c\u200a\u2018knowing\u2019\u200a\u201d sales to minors and do not \u201cprescribe age verification \nin any form.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30 (citation omitted).  It is true that Ginsberg \ndid not consider any First Amendment claim based on the law\u2019s bur-\nden on the rights of adults.  See pp. 20-21, supra.  But that is not \nbecause no such burden existed.  To the contrary, the law defined \n\u201cknowingly\u201d to include not only actual knowledge, but also \u201creason \nto know, or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further in-\nspection or inquiry\u201d into \u201cthe age of the minor.\u201d  Ginsberg, 390 U.S. \nat 646 (citation omitted).  And the law further provided that \u201can hon-\nest mistake\u201d as to age \u201cshall constitute an excuse from liability\u201d only \nif the seller \u201cmade a bona fide attempt to ascertain the true age of \nsuch minor.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  In practice, therefore, the \nNew York law required sellers to verify the age of individuals seek-\ning to buy covered materials if they were not obviously adults.  Sim-\nilar laws remain commonplace today.  See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code \n\u00a7 313.1(a) (West 2024) (making it unlawful to distribute harmful sex-\nual material to a minor while \u201cfail[ing] to exercise reasonable care \nin ascertaining the true age of [the] minor\u201d); 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. \nAnn. \u00a7 5/11-21(b) (West 2017) (similar); N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 14-\n190.15(a) and (c)(3) (2023) (prohibiting the distribution of harmful \nmaterial to minors but providing an affirmative defense if the de-\nfendant \u201crequested and received\u201d an \u201cofficial governmental or edu-\ncational identification card\u201d indicating the minor was over 18). \n \n \n\n29 \n \npart and dissenting in part).  But the longstanding and \nwidespread tradition of restricting minors\u2019 access to \nharmful sexual material in the physical world suggests \nthat content-based age-verification requirements are \nnot inherently inconsistent with the First Amendment.  \nCf. Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 301 (2024) (relying on \n\u201chistory and tradition, as we have done before when \nconsidering the scope of the First Amendment\u201d).  And \nthat tradition provides further reason why courts re-\nviewing laws like H.B. 1181 should not reflexively treat \nstrict scrutiny as \u201ca death knell.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a. \n2. An appropriately tailored age-verification require-\nment could satisfy strict scrutiny \nIn Reno, 521 U.S. at 876-877, and Ashcroft II, 542 \nU.S. at 668, this Court expressed reservations about \nage-verification technology in light of its cost and sus-\nceptibility to circumvention by minors.  More than two \ndecades later, however, there is good reason to believe \nthat age verification has significantly improved on both \nfronts.  Cf. id. at 671 (noting that \u201c[m]ore and better \nfiltering alternatives may\u201d have already emerged in the \nfive years between the creation of the preliminary-\ninjunction record and this Court\u2019s decision).  In the \ndistrict court, respondent offered evidence that \u201c[a]ge \nverification providers have invested heavily\u201d in anticir-\ncumvention technology and that competition has low-\nered the cost of deploying age verification for entities \nlike petitioners.  D. Ct. Doc. 26-6, at 15 (Aug. 18, 2023); \nsee id. at 14-16, 18-21.  Entirely new and potentially less \nburdensome methods of age verification have also be-\ncome widely available in recent years.  See id. at 8-12 \n(describing, e.g., \u201cfacial age estimation\u201d technology); \nWeProtect Global Alliance, The role of age verification \ntechnology in tackling child sexual exploitation and \n\n30 \n \nabuse online 10, 15 (Nov. 2022), https://tinyurl.com/\n4mybf4tv.   \nThe United States takes no position on whether H.B. \n1181, or any other specific existing or proposed law, sat-\nisfies strict scrutiny.  That is a fact-intensive question \nbest answered on a full record and with the benefit of \nfull consideration by the lower courts.  But recent tech-\nnological developments may provide reason to believe \nthat appropriately tailored age-verification laws may \nsatisfy strict scrutiny today even if they would not have \ndone so in years past.  And the Court should decline to \nadopt the contrary reasoning advanced by petitioners \nand the district court, aspects of which would threaten \nto foreclose any effective age-verification requirement, \nno matter how carefully drawn. \nTo take one example, petitioners and the district \ncourt place substantial emphasis on underinclusivity \nconcerns driven by H.B. 1181\u2019s inapplicability to search \nengines and social media.  See Pet. Br. 38-39; Pet. App. \n112a-114a.  But \u201cthe First Amendment imposes no free-\nstanding \u2018underinclusiveness limitation.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Williams-\nYulee v. Florida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015) (citation \nomitted); see Pet. App. 25a.  To the contrary, \u201cCongress \nneed not deal with every problem at once.\u201d Denver \nArea, 518 U.S. at 757.  And if there were ever a problem \nthat governments may understandably want to address \nincrementally, rather than \u201cin one fell swoop,\u201d Wil-\nliams-Yulee, 575 U.S. at 449, it would be the complex \nchallenge of protecting minors from sexually harmful \nmaterial on the Internet.  See pp. 26-27, supra.  It is \ndoubtful that the limitations on H.B. 1181\u2019s scope re-\nflect an impermissible legislative attempt to give some \npreferred purveyors of sexual material an \u201cadvantage\u201d \n\n31 \n \nover others.  City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 51 \n(1994).   \nEchoing Ashcroft II, petitioners and the district \ncourt also rely extensively on content-filtering technol-\nogy as an alternative to age verification that would \u201ctar-\nget minor[s\u2019] access to pornography with fewer burdens \non adults\u2019 access to protected sexually explicit materi-\nals.\u201d  Pet. App. 128a; see Pet. Br. 39-41; see also Ash-\ncroft II, 542 U.S. at 666-670.  The question under strict \nscrutiny, however, is whether a less restrictive alterna-\ntive would be equally effective in \u201caccomplish[ing]\u201d the \nlegislative objective, Ashcroft II, 542 U.S. at 673\u2014not \nmerely whether the alternative would \u201ctarget\u201d the prob-\nlem, Pet. App. 128a.  To be sure, content-filtering tech-\nnology is an important tool\u2014in part because, as the dis-\ntrict court emphasized, parents can use it to restrict \ntheir children\u2019s access to sexually explicit content \nonline.  See id. at 129a-131a.  But \u201cfiltering software de-\npends upon parents willing to decide where their chil-\ndren will surf the web and able to enforce that decision.\u201d  \nAshcroft II, 542 U.S. at 685 (Breyer, J., dissenting); see \n8/23/23 Tr. 13-17 (confirming that filters\u2019 effectiveness \ncan depend on \u201cparents knowing they\u2019re available and \nthen understanding how to implement\u201d and maintain \nthem); cf. U.S. Surgeon Gen.\u2019s Advisory, supra, at 13.  \nContent filtering has now been \u201cwidely available and \neasy to obtain\u201d for decades, Mukasey, 534 F.3d at 201 \n(citation omitted), but the problem of child exposure to \nsexual content online has only worsened during that \ntime.  Two decades of experience thus provide further \nreason not to treat as controlling Ashcroft II\u2019s tentative \nview that content filtering \u201cmay be more effective\u201d than \nage verification.  542 U.S. at 673. \n\n32 \n \nIn recent years, Texas and many other States have \napparently concluded that content filtering and other \nvoluntary measures have proved insufficient to address \nthe worsening problem of children\u2019s ready access to \nharmful sexual material online, and that some form of \nage-verification requirement is necessary.  Particularly \ngiven the rapidly evolving state of the relevant technol-\nogy, this Court should make clear that the application \nof strict scrutiny does not necessarily foreclose appro-\npriately tailored age-verification requirements.  In as-\nsessing any particular law, courts should consider, \namong other issues, the accuracy, efficacy, and accessi-\nbility of the relevant age-verification technologies; the \neffectiveness of alternative regulatory measures; and \nthe burdens the law imposes on adults seeking to access \nconstitutionally protected speech. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nvacated.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, an internal strategic reflection, does not introduce new external evidence but instead synthesizes my existing knowledge and charts a course for future inquiry. As such, my prior beliefs remain stable and are reinforced.\n\nMy understanding of the case remains centered on the complex decision tree presented by the respondent's brief, which offers the Court multiple pathways to rule. The central conflict is between the petitioners' reliance on the *Ashcroft v. ACLU* line of precedents (mandating strict scrutiny for content-based burdens on adult speech) and the respondent's (Texas's) reliance on *Ginsberg v. New York* (allowing rational-basis review for regulations on minors' access to harmful material).\n\nMy belief state continues to account for the significant complicating factors introduced by Texas, which have shifted my predictive model from a simple binary choice to a multi-faceted analysis:\n*   **The Factual Dispute:** The core argument that modern, \"commercially reasonable\" age-verification technology has rendered the factual underpinnings of *Ashcroft v. ACLU* obsolete.\n*   **The Doctrinal Challenge:** The explicit call for the Court to overrule *Ashcroft II* if it is found to require strict scrutiny in this context.\n*   **The Tiered Legal Strategy:** The presence of fallback arguments, including the application of intermediate scrutiny (*City of Renton*) or the assertion that H.B. 1181 could survive even strict scrutiny.\n*   **The Procedural Off-Ramp:** The emphasis on the high burden required to sustain a pre-enforcement facial challenge, which could allow the Court to uphold the law without reaching the merits of the First Amendment scrutiny question.\n\nThe strategic thinking in the observation correctly identifies the next critical piece of evidence needed to refine my prediction: the position of the U.S. Solicitor General. The Solicitor General's amicus brief is a highly influential signal that could endorse one side's framework, propose a middle ground, or introduce an entirely new legal test. My current predictive model is poised to incorporate this key input, but until that information is received, my beliefs about the case's legal dynamics are unchanged. My uncertainty remains high due to the multiple, viable legal and factual pathways Texas has presented to the Court.",

          "task_beliefs": "The arrival of the amicus brief from the U.S. Solicitor General (SG) is a pivotal event that directly addresses the central uncertainty in my previous belief state. This observation provides a highly influential signal regarding the proper legal framework, significantly refining my predictive model. My prior beliefs are updated, not replaced, as this new evidence provides a clear path through the complex decision tree previously identified.\n\nMy understanding of the case is now anchored by the SG's official position. The United States, as amicus curiae, is \"SUPPORTING VACATUR.\" This is a direct recommendation for a specific procedural outcome. The core of the SG's argument, as revealed in the brief, is that the Fifth Circuit erred by applying rational-basis review and that **strict scrutiny is the correct standard**. This directly supports the petitioners' primary argument and squarely rejects Texas's reliance on *Ginsberg v. New York* for this type of law, which burdens adult access to protected speech.\n\nThis new information sharpens my prediction in several key ways:\n1.  **Increased Confidence in Strict Scrutiny:** The SG's forceful argument that H.B. 1181 is a content-based regulation subject to strict scrutiny, citing the *Ashcroft v. ACLU* line of cases, makes it substantially more likely that a majority of the Court will adopt this view. The SG's opinion often carries significant weight and provides a well-reasoned basis for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit.\n\n2.  **Identification of a Likely \"Off-Ramp\":** The SG's recommendation to **vacate and remand** provides the Court with an elegant and common procedural disposition. This allows the justices to correct the Fifth Circuit's legal error on the standard of review without needing to perform the fact-intensive strict scrutiny analysis themselves on a preliminary injunction record. This outcome has now become a high-probability scenario.\n\n3.  **Clarification of the \"Middle Ground\":** My prior model accounted for the possibility of a middle ground, and the SG's brief articulates exactly what that looks like. While siding with the petitioners on the *standard of review*, the SG explicitly states that \"the First Amendment does not necessarily foreclose appropriately tailored age-verification laws\" and that such a requirement \"could satisfy strict scrutiny.\" This is a crucial signal to the Court, particularly to justices who are sympathetic to the law's purpose. It allows them to rule against Texas on the legal question presented while leaving the door open for the law (or a similar one) to be upheld later on a more developed factual record.\n\n4.  **Reframing the Factual Dispute:** The SG's brief effectively neutralizes Texas's argument that technological advancements have rendered *Ashcroft II* obsolete *at this stage*. Instead, it reframes it as a factual question that is part of the strict scrutiny analysis itself\u2014i.e., whether age verification is now the least restrictive means. By recommending a remand, the SG is arguing that this factual question should be decided by the lower courts in the first instance, not by the Supreme Court.\n\nMy belief state, which was previously a complex map of Texas's multiple, competing arguments, has now consolidated around a much clearer primary pathway. The SG has provided a roadmap for the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit on narrow grounds, reaffirming the *Ashcroft* precedent for content-based laws on the internet while acknowledging the government's compelling interest and the potential for new technology to change the calculus under a strict scrutiny analysis. My uncertainty regarding the *ultimate* constitutionality of H.B. 1181 remains, but my confidence in predicting the Court's answer to the specific legal question\u2014that strict scrutiny applies\u2014has increased dramatically.",

My confidence in the existing predictive model has now reached its peak based on the available information.\n\nMy understanding of the case and its likely trajectory remains stable and is now fully consolidated. The core components of my belief are:\n\n1.  **The Standard of Review is the Decisive Question:** The central legal dispute is definitively framed as a choice between rational basis review (argued by Texas, based on *Ginsberg v. New York*) and strict scrutiny (argued by the petitioners, based on *Ashcroft v. ACLU*). My belief is that the Court's decision will hinge entirely on which precedent it deems controlling for a law that burdens adult access to a substantial category of online speech.\n\n2.  **The SG's Position is the Key Signal:** The SG's amicus brief remains the most influential piece of evidence. By unequivocally siding with the petitioners on the standard of review, the SG has provided a powerful and persuasive argument for the Court to adopt. The United States' position that the Fifth Circuit erred and that H.B. 1181 is a content-based regulation subject to strict scrutiny makes it highly probable that a majority of the Court will agree.\n\n3.  **A \"Vacate and Remand\" Outcome is the Most Likely Path:** The SG's recommendation to vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment and remand the case for analysis under strict scrutiny provides the Court with a well-established and procedurally sound \"off-ramp.\" This disposition is highly attractive as it allows the Court to correct a significant legal error on a core First Amendment principle without needing to engage in a fact-intensive analysis of whether H.B. 1181 is the \"least restrictive means\" on the current, underdeveloped preliminary injunction record. This has solidified as my primary predicted outcome.\n\n4.  **The \"Middle Ground\" is Preserved:** My belief state incorporates the nuance provided by the SG. The Court can (and likely will) rule against Texas on the legal question presented while simultaneously acknowledging the compelling government interest in protecting minors. The SG's explicit statement that \"appropriately tailored age-verification laws\" *could* satisfy strict scrutiny gives the Court a way to signal to lower courts and legislatures that such laws are not per se unconstitutional, but must survive the rigorous analysis that the Fifth Circuit failed to apply.\n\nIn summary, my belief state has evolved from mapping multiple uncertain pathways to a confident prediction centered on a single, coherent scenario. The arrival of the SG brief was the pivotal update, and this final internal review confirms that all evidence points toward the Supreme Court ruling that **strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review**, and consequently vacating the Fifth Circuit's decision and remanding for further proceedings under that standard.",
