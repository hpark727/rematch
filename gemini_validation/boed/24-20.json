    "facts_of_the_case": "A group of United States citizens who were injured in terror attacks in Israel, along with the estates and survivors of U.S. citizens killed in such attacks, filed a lawsuit in 2004 against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PLO, founded in 1964, conducts Palestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Permanent Observer to the United Nations, while the PA was established under the 1993 Oslo Accords to serve as the interim governing body for parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The plaintiffs sought damages under the Anti-Terrorism Act for the defendants\u2019 alleged involvement in these attacks. At trial, a jury found the defendants liable for six terror attacks and awarded $218.5 million in damages (automatically trebled to $655.5 million under the Anti-Terrorism Act), but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated this judgment in 2016, finding that U.S. courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the PLO and PA.\n\nIn 2019, Congress enacted the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. This law deemed the PLO and PA to have consented to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts if they engaged in certain conduct after the law\u2019s enactment: either making payments to families of deceased terrorists or designees of imprisoned terrorists who harmed U.S. nationals, or conducting various activities within the United States (with some exceptions for UN-related activities). After the district court found that the defendants had made qualifying payments following the Act\u2019s enactment, the Second Circuit ultimately concluded that this consent provision violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",

It correctly identifies the core legal question, outlines the necessary types of information (arguments, precedents, SG's view), and formulates a concrete, high-value next step: analyzing the petition for certiorari. \n\nTask EIG is high (0.7) because this structured plan is the blueprint for all subsequent, high-yield information gathering. While it doesn't retrieve data itself, it ensures the next action will be maximally informative for predicting the case outcome, moving the agent from a state of zero knowledge to a state of targeted inquiry.\n\nDesign EIG is even higher (0.8) because the thought process exemplifies a generalizable and highly effective strategy for any SCOTUS case prediction: 1) Deconstruct the case facts to find the core legal question, 2) Identify the key primary source documents (cert petition, briefs), and 3) Start with the document that frames the petitioner's arguments for the Court.

The beliefs are highly coherent and well-integrated, with no contradictions and a clear logical progression, meriting a coherence score of 0.90. The information density is also high, as the beliefs contain rich, substantive details about the case, legal principles, and procedural posture, supporting a score of 0.85.

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA by \nenacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the Pal-\nestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay any terrorist convicted of or killed \nwhile committing a terror attack against an American \nnational, and the payment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \nconviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); \nor  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the trigger dates. But in the decisions below, \nthe Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. The \ncourt held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Congress \nfrom specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s con-\nsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides the \ndefendant with some \u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return, \nand that the PLO and PA had not received such a benefit.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n\n \n \n (II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, who were plaintiffs-appellants below, \nare: Mark I.

The court\u2019s order denying rehearing in banc (App. \n204a-268a) is reported at 101 F.4th 190. Earlier opinions \nof the court of appeals in Waldman (App. 126a-182a) are \nreported at 835 F.3d 317 and 925 F.3d 570. Opinions of the \ndistrict court (App. 71a-125a) are reported at 578 F. Supp. \n3d 577 (Fuld), 590 F. Supp. 3d 589 (Sokolow), and 607 F. \nSupp. 3d 323 (Sokolow).1 Other opinions of the district \ncourt (App. 183a-203a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment and order \non September 8, 2023, and denied timely rehearing peti-\ntions on May 10, 2024. App. 204a-268a. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. App. 307a-317a. \n \n \n \n1 The Sokolow case was captioned in the Second Circuit as Waldman \nv. Palestine Liberation Organization. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, \nJudge Menashi (joined by Chief Judge Livingston and \nJudges Sullivan and Park) identified this case as one of \n\u201cexceptional importance.\u201d App. 232a. To start, the Second \nCircuit facially invalidated a federal statute as unconstitu-\ntional. That step, \u201con its own,\u201d warrants immediate re-\nview. Id. at 233a. \nBut the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) is not just any federal \nstatute. It was enacted by Congress, in direct response to \nlower-court decisions in this case, for the express purpose \nof ensuring the courthouse door did not close on American \nvictims of international terrorism. Under the PSJVTA, \nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Pales-\ntinian Authority (PA) are deemed to consent to jurisdic-\ntion in cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) if, fol-\nlowing specified trigger dates, they pay financial rewards \nto terrorists for killing or injuring Americans or they en-\ngage in any activity in the United States (with certain ex-\nceptions). The political branches determined that this \nstatute serves vital national interests in disrupting and \ndeterring terrorism, compensating American terror vic-\ntims, and promoting peace in the Middle East.  \nThe ruling below not only renders the ATA a dead let-\nter in its heartland application, but it also severely re-\nstricts the power of Congress to provide for jurisdiction \nover any extraterritorial events. In short, the Second Cir-\ncuit hamstrung Congress on matters involving foreign af-\nfairs and national security. \nThat decision is more than dangerous; it is flat wrong. \nIt disregards the original public meaning of the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, instead applying to \nthe federal government the territorial limitations on state \njurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment. As Judge \n\n3 \n \n \nOldham explained when this issue was before the Fifth \nCircuit, \u201cI do not understand how or why we\u2019d take an un-\noriginalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, \npull it back in time to 1791, and use it to blind ourselves to \nan originalist interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d \nDouglass v. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 285 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (dissenting).  \nBut the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis would be wrong \neven under Fourteenth Amendment standards. It ignored \nthis Court\u2019s instruction that an exercise of personal juris-\ndiction satisfies due process if the defendant received \n\u201cfair warning\u201d that \u201ca particular activity may subject \nthem to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d and if the \nexercise of jurisdiction is \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. \nDist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358-359 (2021) (quotation marks \nomitted). As the Second Circuit acknowledged, App. 30a, \nthe PSJVTA indisputably satisfies those \u201cbasic principles \nof due process\u201d: It provides clear warning about exactly \nwhat conduct will give rise to jurisdiction in exactly what \nkinds of cases; and it advances the federal government\u2019s \nlegitimate interests in deterring and disrupting terror-\nism, protecting Americans, and ending the PLO and PA\u2019s \ninstitutionalized practice of promoting terrorism using fi-\nnancial rewards. \nThe decision below also conflicts with this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions on deemed-consent statutes, most prominently \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). In Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it \nhad \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction when it engaged \nin the consent-triggering conduct specified by statute, de-\nspite \u201cappreciat[ing] the jurisdictional consequences\u201d of \ndoing so. Id. at 144 (plurality). This Court rejected the de-\nfendant\u2019s argument, since \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 \n\n4 \n \n \nattach jurisdictional consequences to what some might \ndismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145.  \nInstead of following Mallory, the Second Circuit in-\nvented a new \u201creciprocity\u201d test, under which a deemed-\nconsent statute is valid only if the defendant receives a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return for submitting to juris-\ndiction. App. 38a. The Second Circuit created this test for \nthe supposed purpose of ensuring that the consent-mani-\nfesting conduct is a sufficiently close \u201cproxy for actual \nconsent\u201d (ibid.)\u2014the very concept this Court rejected in \nMallory. \nThe Second Circuit then misapplied its newly created \ntest by holding that a defendant receives no \u201cbenefit\u201d if \nthe defendant\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct is unlaw-\nful. As Judge Menashi put it, that is simply \u201cperverse.\u201d \nApp. 231a. A defendant who \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from \nthe forum without permission to do so should get lesser \nprotection from having to face a trial on the merits in the \nforum\u2019s courts, not greater. App. 232a.  \nThis Court\u2019s immediate intervention is needed. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The ATA provides a private right of action to U.S. \nnationals and their families to recover for death and inju-\nries sustained by reason of an act of international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired by a civil \nsuit brought against the PLO for the murder of Leon \nKlinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American cruise ship \npassenger who was shot in the face and thrown into the \nsea by PLO hijackers.  \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family held the PLO accountable for the \nmurder by invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction. \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992). The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee explained that the ATA would \u201copen[] the \n\n5 \n \n \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA by \nenacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the Pal-\nestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay any terrorist convicted of or killed \nwhile committing a terror attack against an American \nnational, and the payment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \nconviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); \nor  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the trigger dates. But in the decisions below, \nthe Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. The \ncourt held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Congress \nfrom specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s con-\nsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides the \ndefendant with some \u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return, \nand that the PLO and PA had not received such a benefit.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n\n \n \n (II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, who were plaintiffs-appellants below, \nare: Mark I.

The court\u2019s order denying rehearing in banc (App. \n204a-268a) is reported at 101 F.4th 190. Earlier opinions \nof the court of appeals in Waldman (App. 126a-182a) are \nreported at 835 F.3d 317 and 925 F.3d 570. Opinions of the \ndistrict court (App. 71a-125a) are reported at 578 F.

App. 204a-268a. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. App. 307a-317a. \n \n \n \n1 The Sokolow case was captioned in the Second Circuit as Waldman \nv. Palestine Liberation Organization. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, \nJudge Menashi (joined by Chief Judge Livingston and \nJudges Sullivan and Park) identified this case as one of \n\u201cexceptional importance.\u201d App. 232a. To start, the Second \nCircuit facially invalidated a federal statute as unconstitu-\ntional. That step, \u201con its own,\u201d warrants immediate re-\nview. Id. at 233a. \nBut the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) is not just any federal \nstatute. It was enacted by Congress, in direct response to \nlower-court decisions in this case, for the express purpose \nof ensuring the courthouse door did not close on American \nvictims of international terrorism. Under the PSJVTA, \nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Pales-\ntinian Authority (PA) are deemed to consent to jurisdic-\ntion in cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) if, fol-\nlowing specified trigger dates, they pay financial rewards \nto terrorists for killing or injuring Americans or they en-\ngage in any activity in the United States (with certain ex-\nceptions). The political branches determined that this \nstatute serves vital national interests in disrupting and \ndeterring terrorism, compensating American terror vic-\ntims, and promoting peace in the Middle East.  \nThe ruling below not only renders the ATA a dead let-\nter in its heartland application, but it also severely re-\nstricts the power of Congress to provide for jurisdiction \nover any extraterritorial events. In short, the Second Cir-\ncuit hamstrung Congress on matters involving foreign af-\nfairs and national security. \nThat decision is more than dangerous; it is flat wrong. \nIt disregards the original public meaning of the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, instead applying to \nthe federal government the territorial limitations on state \njurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment. As Judge \n\n3 \n \n \nOldham explained when this issue was before the Fifth \nCircuit, \u201cI do not understand how or why we\u2019d take an un-\noriginalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, \npull it back in time to 1791, and use it to blind ourselves to \nan originalist interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d \nDouglass v. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 285 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (dissenting).  \nBut the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis would be wrong \neven under Fourteenth Amendment standards. It ignored \nthis Court\u2019s instruction that an exercise of personal juris-\ndiction satisfies due process if the defendant received \n\u201cfair warning\u201d that \u201ca particular activity may subject \nthem to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d and if the \nexercise of jurisdiction is \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. \nDist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358-359 (2021) (quotation marks \nomitted). As the Second Circuit acknowledged, App. 30a, \nthe PSJVTA indisputably satisfies those \u201cbasic principles \nof due process\u201d: It provides clear warning about exactly \nwhat conduct will give rise to jurisdiction in exactly what \nkinds of cases; and it advances the federal government\u2019s \nlegitimate interests in deterring and disrupting terror-\nism, protecting Americans, and ending the PLO and PA\u2019s \ninstitutionalized practice of promoting terrorism using fi-\nnancial rewards. \nThe decision below also conflicts with this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions on deemed-consent statutes, most prominently \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). In Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it \nhad \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction when it engaged \nin the consent-triggering conduct specified by statute, de-\nspite \u201cappreciat[ing] the jurisdictional consequences\u201d of \ndoing so. Id. at 144 (plurality). This Court rejected the de-\nfendant\u2019s argument, since \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 \n\n4 \n \n \nattach jurisdictional consequences to what some might \ndismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145.  \nInstead of following Mallory, the Second Circuit in-\nvented a new \u201creciprocity\u201d test, under which a deemed-\nconsent statute is valid only if the defendant receives a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return for submitting to juris-\ndiction. App. 38a. The Second Circuit created this test for \nthe supposed purpose of ensuring that the consent-mani-\nfesting conduct is a sufficiently close \u201cproxy for actual \nconsent\u201d (ibid.)\u2014the very concept this Court rejected in \nMallory. \nThe Second Circuit then misapplied its newly created \ntest by holding that a defendant receives no \u201cbenefit\u201d if \nthe defendant\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct is unlaw-\nful. As Judge Menashi put it, that is simply \u201cperverse.\u201d \nApp. 231a. A defendant who \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from \nthe forum without permission to do so should get lesser \nprotection from having to face a trial on the merits in the \nforum\u2019s courts, not greater. App. 232a.  \nThis Court\u2019s immediate intervention is needed. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The ATA provides a private right of action to U.S. \nnationals and their families to recover for death and inju-\nries sustained by reason of an act of international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired by a civil \nsuit brought against the PLO for the murder of Leon \nKlinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American cruise ship \npassenger who was shot in the face and thrown into the \nsea by PLO hijackers.  \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family held the PLO accountable for the \nmurder by invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction. \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992). The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee explained that the ATA would \u201copen[] the \n\n5 \n \n \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil \nATA cases based on their systematic and continuous pres-\nence in the United States. App. 193a n.10 (collecting \ncases). In 2016, however, the Second Circuit held that U.S. \ncourts could no longer do so because this Court had \u201cnar-\nrowed the test for general jurisdiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. \nBauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). App. 141a. It also found \nspecific jurisdiction over the PLO and PA absent because \nthe \u201cconduct that could have subjected them to liability \nunder the ATA\u201d had occurred \u201coutside the United \nStates.\u201d App. 166a. \n2. Congress responded to the decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked a traditional basis for the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any defend-\nant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates from \nmaintaining an office or spending money in the United \nStates\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant maintains \n\u201cany office within the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d \nafter January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the date of the oc-\ncurrence of the act of international terrorism.\u201d Pub. L. \nNo. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183-3185 (formerly codified at 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)). The House Judiciary Committee \n\n6 \n \n \nexplained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to condition\u201d the \nPLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the United States \non [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Congress has re-\npeatedly tied their continued receipt of these privileges to \ntheir adherence to their commitment to renounce terror-\nism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018).  \nIn response to another Second Circuit ruling in this \ncase, which held that the ATCA\u2019s factual predicates had \nnot been met, App. 29a-30a, Congress amended the ATCA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)). The PSJVTA \nhas two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the law\u2019s \nenactment, the defendant makes any payment to a de-\nsignee of an individual imprisoned for, or killed while, \ncommitting a terror attack that killed or injured a na-\ntional of the United States, if the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorist\u2019s death or imprisonment. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A).  \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after enactment, \nthe defendant \u201cconducts any activity while physically \npresent in the United States on behalf of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization or the Palestinian Author-\nity.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to six exceptions, \nincluding maintaining an office or conducting an activ-\nity \u201cexclusively for the purpose of conducting official \nbusiness of the United Nations.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), \n(B). \n\n7 \n \n \nCongress instructed that the statute must be \u201cliberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \nThese cases arose out of a series of terror attacks in \nIsrael that killed or injured U.S. nationals. Officials and \nemployees of the PLO and PA planned, directed, and par-\nticipated in these attacks. \n1. The Sokolow case was brought by American fam-\nilies victimized in terror attacks in Israel between 2001 \nand 2004. Mark Sokolow and his family were on vacation \nin Jerusalem, buying a pair of shoes for their twelve-year-\nold daughter when a PA intelligence agent detonated a 22-\npound bomb in her backpack, killing one and injuring the \nSokolows and more than 100 others. Alan Bauer and his \nseven-year-old son were walking down a crowded street \nwhen a suicide bomber blew himself up at the direction of \na PA security officer, sending shrapnel into the father\u2019s \narm and the boy\u2019s brain. Scott Goldberg was killed on his \nway to work when a PA police officer detonated himself \non a local bus; Goldberg left a widow and seven children. \nFour other plaintiffs died when a massive bomb went off \nin a university cafeteria at lunchtime; their parents \nlearned about their deaths at home in the United States\u2014\nsome by recognizing their children\u2019s bodies or personal \neffects on the news. \nThe Fuld case was brought by the family of Ari Fuld, \nan American citizen and father of four. In September \n2018, Mahmoud Abbas, the Chairman of the PLO and \nPresident of the PA, falsely announced that the Govern-\nment of Israel was planning to establish special Jewish \nprayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam\u2019s \nholiest sites. C.A. Doc. 66, at A47-49, Case No. 22-76 (2d \nCir. 2023). Hours later, a Palestinian terrorist, incited by \n\n8 \n \n \nAbbas\u2019s false accusations, stabbed Mr. Fuld to death out-\nside a shopping mall. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial, the jury found \nthat PLO and PA employees, acting within the scope of \ntheir employment, had planned or participated in each of \nthe attacks. C.A. Doc. 81-3, at 9436, Case No. 15-3135. Ev-\nidence also showed that the PLO and PA had provided so-\ncalled \u201cmartyr\u201d payments to the families of the suicide \nterrorists in honor of their attacks and had rewarded the \nsurviving officers\u2014imprisoned for their crimes\u2014with \ngenerous salaries and promotions. C.A. Doc. 64, at 4375, \n4385, Case No. 15-3135; C.A. Doc. 67, at 5230-5231, Case \nNo. 15-3135. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million in \ndamages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA.  \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit reversed for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction. App. 1a. The circuit held that the \nPLO and PA enjoy due process rights because \u201cneither \nthe PLO nor the PA is recognized by the United States as \na sovereign state.\u201d App. 153a. It also held that the test for \npersonal jurisdiction is \u201cthe same under both the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d App. 156a. Applying \nFourteenth Amendment standards, it held that U.S. \ncourts could not exercise general jurisdiction because the \ndefendants were \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States.\u201d App. 167a.  \nPetitioners sought review in this Court, which called \nfor the views of the Solicitor General. The Solicitor Gen-\neral recommended against review, saying that \u201cfurther \ndevelopment in the lower courts is likely to be useful be-\nfore this Court addresses\u201d the issues. U.S. Br. at 17, \n\n9 \n \n \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 16-1071 (Feb. \n2018). This Court denied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nAfter Congress enacted the ATCA, the Sokolow \nplaintiffs moved to recall the Second Circuit\u2019s mandate. \nThe court denied the motion, holding that the term \n\u201cwaiver or suspension\u201d as used in the ATCA meant only \nan \u201cexpress waiver,\u201d so that the statute\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. App. 133a. Congress then en-\nacted the PSJVTA, and this Court vacated the Second \nCircuit\u2019s judgment and remanded for further considera-\ntion in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 (2020). The \nSecond Circuit in turn remanded to the district court for \nfindings and conclusions.  \n3. On remand to the district court in Sokolow, and on \na motion to dismiss in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged \nthe PSJVTA on the ground that the statute facially vio-\nlated their right to due process under the Fifth Amend-\nment. The United States intervened in both cases to de-\nfend the law\u2019s constitutionality. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092403(a).  \nIn Sokolow, plaintiffs provided extensive evidence, \nwhich the PLO and PA did not dispute, that following the \nPSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, defendants systematically paid \nsalaries to at least 175 terrorists \u201cby reason of\u201d terror at-\ntacks that resulted in the death of Americans. Dist. Ct. \nDkt. 1018, \u00b6\u00b6 2-202, No. 04 Civ. 397 (S.D.N.Y.); Dist. Ct. \nDkt. 1015-1, No. 04 Civ. 397 (S.D.N.Y.). Plaintiffs also pro-\nvided evidence that the PLO and PA had engaged in post-\ntrigger-date activities while present in the United States \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption. App. 98a. \nPlaintiffs in Fuld made similar allegations in an amended \ncomplaint, which tracked much of this evidence. App. 95a.  \nThe Sokolow and Fuld district courts accepted that \nthe PLO and PA had met the factual requirements of both \nprongs of the PSJVTA. However, they held the law fa-\ncially unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of \n\n10 \n \n \nthe Fifth Amendment. App. 87a-90a, 108a-124a. They rea-\nsoned that this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \nconsent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-Interna-\ntional Shoe precedents \u201cobsolete.\u201d App. 76a. In so ruling, \nthe Fuld district court relied on the Pennsylvania Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern \nRailway Co., 266 A.3d 542 (Pa. 2021), rev\u2019d, 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). App. 113a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in the relevant \njurisdiction-triggering conduct by paying terrorists who \nhad murdered Americans and by conducting non-exempt \nactivities inside the United States. App. 38a. It also did \nnot dispute that the PSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due pro-\ncess requirements\u201d by providing fair warning to the de-\nfendants of the relevant conduct and by reasonably ad-\nvancing legitimate governmental interests. App. 29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause requires a consent-to-\njurisdiction statute to provide a defendant with some \u201cre-\nciprocal bargain\u201d in return. App. 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as such a \u201cbenefit.\u201d According to the court, this was \nbecause the PLO and PA\u2019s consent-manifesting conduct \nwas \u201cprohibited\u201d by prior law. App. 28a.  \nFinally, the panel rejected the requests of the United \nStates and plaintiffs to reconsider its prior decision that \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \u201cparallel one an-\nother in civil cases,\u201d on the ground that this holding was \nnow the law of the Circuit. App. 47a.  \nPlaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing en \nbanc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. App. 208a. \n\n11 \n \n \nJudge Menashi, joined in full or in part by three other \njudges, dissented. App. 229a-267a. In his view, \u201c[t]he \npanel\u2019s decision lacks a basis in the Constitution and can-\nnot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent on per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d App. 230a.  \nJudge Menashi explained that the panel\u2019s decision \nrested on three errors. First, \u201c[n]o law requires Congress \nto extend a benefit to those over whom it authorizes per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Instead, as the Supreme Court has \nmade clear, consent based on conduct need only be know-\ning and voluntary and have a nexus to the forum.\u201d Ibid. \nThose conditions were satisfied here. Ibid. \nSecond, \u201ceven if the panel were correct that the Due \nProcess Clause required a reciprocal benefit, the statute \nhere involves such a benefit because the defendants are \ndeemed to have consented based on the privilege of resid-\ning and conducting business in the United States\u2014not to \nmention furthering their political goals at the expense of \nAmerican lives.\u201d App. 231a.  \nThird, \u201cthe federal government is not similarly situ-\nated to the state governments in the extraterritorial reach \nof its courts.\u201d App. 232a. Under its original public mean-\ning, \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not limit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the \nfederal courts.\u201d App. 255a. \nJudge Bianco, who sat on the panel that invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, concurred in the denial of rehearing, reiter-\nating his view that the statute is facially unconstitutional. \nApp. 209a-228a. \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Second Circuit declared a federal statute facially \nunconstitutional. The ruling undermines fundamental na-\ntional security and foreign policy determinations at the \nvery core of Congress\u2019s and the President\u2019s constitutional \nauthority and expertise\u2014determinations that the political \nbranches have repeatedly and emphatically reaffirmed in \na series of statutory amendments attempting to overcome \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s misguided decisions. And the deci-\nsion below is already undermining federal authority and \ninterests in a variety of contexts.  \nThe ruling below is also incorrect. It answers a recur-\nring and important question contrary to the original pub-\nlic meaning of the Fifth Amendment; flouts this Court\u2019s \ndecisions; and improperly hamstrings congressional au-\nthority to provide for jurisdiction over extraterritorial \nconduct affecting federal interests. This Court should \ngrant review and reverse. \nI. \nTHE INVALIDATION OF A FEDERAL ANTI-TERRORISM \nSTATUTE MERITS REVIEW \n\u201c[W]hen a lower court has invalidated a federal stat-\nute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant certiorari. \nIancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). The Court ap-\nplies a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of granting writs of \ncertiorari to review decisions of lower courts holding fed-\neral statutes unconstitutional,\u201d Maricopa Cnty. v. Lopez-\nValenzuela, 574 U.S. 1006, 1007 (2014) (Thomas, J., re-\nspecting denial of stay), and it routinely does so even in \nabsence of circuit conflict. See, e.g., SEC v. Jarkesy, No. \n22-859 (2024); Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286 (2024); Con-\nsumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass\u2019n of \nAm., 601 U.S. 416 (2024); United States v.

Vaello Madero, \n596 U.S. 159 (2022).  \n\n13 \n \n \nReview is particularly warranted in light of the sub-\nject-matter of the law struck down and the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s frustration of not one but two statutes enacted on a \nbipartisan basis (in a time of limited bipartisanship). The \nPSJVTA aims to \u201chalt, deter, and disrupt international \nterrorism,\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7-8, and to give \nAmerican terror victims and their families their day in \ncourt.  \nThe Government\u2019s interest in combatting terrorism \n\u201cis an urgent objective of the highest order.\u201d Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010); see \nGamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 687 (2019) (\u201cspecial \nprotection for U.S. nationals serves key national inter-\nests\u201d). The law also gives the PLO and PA reason to end \ntheir notorious pay-for-slay policy, under which terrorists \n(or their families) receive a reward for murdering Jews. \nThat noxious practice is \u201can incentive to commit acts of \nterror,\u201d Taylor Force Act, Pub. L. 115-141, Title X, \n\u00a7\u20091002(1) (22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378c-1 note), and it \u201cthreaten[s] \nprospects for peace, pushing the chance for a Palestinian \nstate further and further out of reach.\u201d 163 Cong. Rec. \nH9650 (Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. Engel).  \nReview is also warranted because the court of appeals \nsecond-guessed the policy judgments reflected in the \nPSJVTA, which are \u201cof a kind for which the Judiciary has \nneither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and which \nhas long been held to belong in the domain of political \npower not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\u201d Chi-\ncago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman SS Corp., 333 U.S. \n103, 111 (1948). Indeed, the law merits especially \u201cre-\nspectful review by courts,\u201d because Congress enacted and \nthe President signed the PSJVTA \u201cin furtherance of their \nstance on a matter of foreign policy.\u201d Bank Markazi v. \nPeterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016). The decision below \nthus \u201cimplicates separation of powers\u201d to an even greater \n\n14 \n \n \nextent than the typical case\u2014in which there are good rea-\nsons for immediate review when \u201ca federal judge strikes \ndown an act of a coequal branch of government.\u201d Heckler \nv. Edwards, 465 U.S. 870, 881 (1984). \nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED BY INVALIDATING \nTHE PSJVTA \nThis Court has never invalidated a federal jurisdic-\ntional statute on due process grounds. Overwhelming his-\ntorical evidence (and scholarly consensus) explain why: \n\u201c[A]s originally understood, the Fifth Amendment did not \nimpose any limits on the personal jurisdiction of the fed-\neral courts. Instead, it was up to Congress to impose such \nlimits by statute.\u201d Douglass, 46 F.4th at 284 (Oldham, J., \ndissenting). No one at the Founding understood the Fifth \nAmendment as constraining Congress\u2019s authority to au-\nthorize jurisdiction over cases involving extraterritorial \nconduct at all; indeed, the federal courts routinely adjudi-\ncated such cases for more than 200 years.  \nBut even if the standards for personal jurisdiction un-\nder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were the \nsame, the court of appeals\u2019 approach was wrong. In enact-\ning the PSJVTA, Congress specified\u2014in advance and \nwith sufficient warning\u2014the conduct that would subject \nthe PLO and PA to jurisdiction in a limited category of \ncivil cases at the heartland of federal concern. That easily \nsatisfies the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s requirement that \nexercises of personal jurisdiction must provide \u201cfair warn-\ning\u201d and must be \u201creasonable, in the context of our federal \nsystem of government.\u201d Ford Motor Co., 592 U.S. at 358 \n(citation omitted). The Second Circuit\u2019s invention of a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d requirement for consent-based \njurisdiction, and the court\u2019s perverse application of that \nnovel test, are both indefensible.  \n\n15 \n \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment Does Not Limit \nCongress\u2019s Authority To Enact Reasonable \nPersonal Jurisdiction Statutes \nThe Second Circuit held that the personal jurisdiction \nlimitations developed under the Fourteenth Amendment \nalso apply in cases in federal court governed by the Fifth \nAmendment. App. 17a, 47a. This was contrary to the orig-\ninal public meaning of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause and its application by this Court since that \ntime. As Professor Sachs explains: \u201cFor the first 150 \nyears of the Republic \u2026 the recognized doctrines of juris-\ndiction worked very differently for state and federal \ncourts.\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1706 (2020). As \noriginally understood, congressional power over personal \njurisdiction was unlimited: \u201cIf Congress wanted to exer-\ncise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a federal court \n\u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and proceed upon \nthe law.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 \n(C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (No. 11,134) (Story, J.)). The decision \nbelow, by subjecting Congress to the same limitations on \njurisdiction that apply to the States, improperly \u201ctakes \nthe Fourteenth Amendment as given, and remakes the \nFifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at 1705. \n1.  The Fifth Amendment\u2019s text, the historical back-\ndrop against which that text was drafted and ratified, and \npractice in the years following ratification all confirm that \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause was not orig-\ninally understood as restricting personal jurisdiction at \nall. Much less did it forbid adjudication if the \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d did not occur \u201cin the United States,\u201d as the Sec-\nond Circuit held. App. 8a. \na. The phrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not call to \nmind limitations on personal jurisdiction based on the lo-\ncation of the underlying conduct. So it was in 1791 as well. \n\n16 \n \n \nFounding-era dictionaries offered two potentially rele-\nvant definitions for \u201cprocess\u201d\u2014one meaning \u201call the pro-\nceedings in any cause\u201d; the other meaning \u201cthe writs and \nprecepts that go forth in an action.\u201d Max Crema & Law-\nrence B. Solum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue Process \nof Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, \n487-488 (2022). Neither sense restricts personal jurisdic-\ntion based on the location of the conduct giving rise to the \ncase. \nb.  The history preceding the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nratification firmly supports the conclusion that the Due \nProcess Clause was not understood to constrain the power \nof the federal courts in adjudicating extraterritorial con-\nduct. When the United States declared independence \nfrom England, its powers of \u201cexternal sovereignty\u201d be-\ncame \u201cvested in the federal government as necessary con-\ncomitants of nationality.\u201d United States v. Curtiss-Wright \nExp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 316-318 (1936) (citing Penhallow \nv. Doane\u2019s Administrator, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54, 80-81 \n(1795)). During the Articles of Confederation period, \ncourts in the newly independent nation adjudicated thou-\nsands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases, which arose from ex-\ntraterritorial events and implicated controversies with \nforeign parties. See Henry J. Bourguignon, The First \nFederal Court: The Federal Appellate Prize Court of the \nAmerican Revolution 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977). Many \ndelegates to the Philadelphia Convention had extensive \nexperience with such cases. Id. at 328-329; see 1 The Rec-\nords of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 124 (Max Far-\nrand ed., 1911) (Farrand). \nBuilding on the Founders\u2019 experience  with prize and \ncapture cases, the Constitution expressly contemplates \nadjudication of cases arising outside the territory of the \nUnited States, including admiralty and maritime cases \n\n17 \n \n \nand crimes \u201cnot committed within any State.\u201d U.S. Const. \nart. III, \u00a7\u20092.  \nThis extraterritorial power was a deliberate feature \nof the constitutional plan. Otherwise, as James Wilson ex-\nplained, the federal government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Debates). At the Philadelphia Convention, \nMadison observed that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establish-\nment commensurate to the legislative authority, was es-\nsential.\u201d 1 Farrand 124. Hamilton echoed this view in the \nFederalist Papers: \u201cIf there are such things as political \naxioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a govern-\nment being co-extensive with its legislative, may be \nranked among the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80 at 476 \n(Rossiter ed. 1961); accord 3 Debates 517 (Pendleton in \nVirginia); 4 Debates 156-158 (Davie in North Carolina). \nPut simply, Congress could legislate extraterritorially\u2014\nand what Congress could legislate, the federal courts \ncould adjudicate.  \nIn the Judiciary Act of 1789, the First Congress \ngranted the federal courts extraterritorial jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. Actions \ntaken by the First Congress are \u201cpresumptively con-\nsistent with the Bill of Rights.\u201d Town of Greece v. Gallo-\nway, 572 U.S. 565, 602 (2014) (Alito, J., concurring). In-\ndeed, during deliberations on the Judiciary Act, \nMadison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted and in-\ntroduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view that the \njudicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with the other \nbranches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. 843 \n(Aug. 29, 1789). \n\n18 \n \n \nc. Nothing in the known historical record of ratifica-\ntion of the Bill of Rights in 1791 indicates that anyone con-\ntemporaneously understood the Due Process Clause as \nlimiting the judicial power of the United States to the ad-\njudication of cases arising within the Nation\u2019s borders. \nSee generally Sachs, supra, at 1706; Crema & Solum, su-\npra, at 507; The Complete Bill of Rights 529-571 (Neil H. \nCogan ed., 2d ed. 2015). To the contrary, practice follow-\ning ratification of the Due Process Clause confirms that it \nimposed no such limitation. In the years following ratifi-\ncation, the Framers\u2014now implementing the Constitution \nthey had drafted, advocated for, and voted to ratify\u2014con-\nfirmed that the judicial power extended to cases involving \nconduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. \nMost prominently, in Talbot v. Jansen, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) \n133 (1795), this Court unanimously affirmed the exercise \nof jurisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of \nan incident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.2 \nTalbot marked the beginning of what would become \nlong-settled and established practice. \u201cThe prosecution \nand punishment of extraterritorial crimes, including \ncrimes committed by aliens, was one of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the decades following ratifica-\ntion, and \u201cthe federal government principally used two en-\nforcement mechanisms\u2014punishment after criminal trial, \nand civil forfeiture after a condemnation by a federal \ncourt sitting in admiralty.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman, Due \n \n2 Every member of the Talbot Court had attended the Philadelphia \nConvention, his home State\u2019s ratifying convention, or both. \n\n19 \n \n \nProcess Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. Rev. 377, 409 (2017). \n\u201cAmericans appeared to believe that both enforcement \nmechanisms were consistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. \nat 410. \n2. \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s \npower to create jurisdiction over foreign conduct and de-\nfendants is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story (riding \nCircuit) explained that Congress could enact a law provid-\ning that \u201ca subject of England, or France, or Russia, hav-\ning a controversy with one of our own citizens, may be \nsummoned from the other end of the globe to obey our \nprocess, and submit to the judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F. \nCas. at 613. And though such a law might be \u201crepugnant \nto the general rights and sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \n\u201c[i]f congress had prescribed such a rule, the court would \ncertainly be bound to follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d \nId. at 613, 615. This Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning \nin Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explain-\ning that \u201cpositive legislation\u201d would be necessary to au-\nthorize federal courts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in \na foreign jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330; see The Marianna \nFlora, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 1, 18 (1825) (Story, J.) (\u201c[T]he \nact of Congress is decisive on th[e] subject\u201d of sending a \nship captured on the high seas for adjudication to the \nUnited States, \u201cand whatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws, there can be no doubt that Courts of justice are \nbound to obey and administer them\u201d). \nNo case went the other way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil \nWar did a single court, state or federal, hold a personal-\njurisdiction statute invalid on due process grounds.\u201d \nSachs, supra, at 1712; accord Chapman, supra, at 442. \nTreatises of the era confirm that the federal courts \nproperly exercised jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on \n\n20 \n \n \nAmerican Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, \nfor the purpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where \na piratical offence has been committed.\u201d) (emphasis in \noriginal).  \nAfter the Civil War, this Court held repeatedly that if \na sovereign is permitted to exclude an entity from its ter-\nritory, the sovereign has the right to permit entry on rea-\nsonable conditions, including consent to suit. See, e.g., St. \nClair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350, 356 (1882). The Court also ap-\nplied that principle to the Fifth Amendment. In Baltimore \n& Ohio Railroad Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65 \n(1870), this Court upheld the assertion of personal juris-\ndiction by courts of the District of Columbia over a Mary-\nland corporation that injured a passenger in Virginia. It \nreasoned that Congress was within its rights to determine \nthat a corporation \u201cmay exercise its authority in a foreign \nterritory [i.e., in D.C.] upon such conditions as may be \nprescribed by the law of the place. One of these conditions \nmay be that it shall consent to be sued there.\u201d Id. at 81. \nIn sum, an in personam suit \u201ccould be maintained by \nanyone on any claim in any place the defendant could be \nfound.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plurality).  \n3. Personal jurisdiction rules under the Fourteenth \nAmendment changed in the Lochner era, when this Court \nbegan invoking due process to restrict state authority to \nadjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in other \nStates. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U.S. \n394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills v. \nMenefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); Simon v. S. R. Co., \n236 U.S. 115, 130 (1915). But even then, the Court repeat-\nedly reaffirmed that territorial limitations imposed on the \nStates by the Fourteenth Amendment afford \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n21 \n \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933); Cook v. Tait, 265 \nU.S. 47, 55-56 (1924); Panama R. Co. v. Napier Shipping \nCo., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897) (\u201cThe fact that the cause of \naction arose in the waters of a foreign port is immate-\nrial.\u201d). \nThis Court has continued to restrict state power to \nexercise personal jurisdiction by imposing \u201cterritorial \nlimitations\u201d under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, which \u201cact[s] as an instrument of in-\nterstate federalism.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Supe-\nrior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 263 (2017). Yet it has \nexpressed the opposite view about the territorial compe-\ntence of the National Government: \u201cIf Congress has pro-\nvided an unmistakable instruction that the provision is ex-\ntraterritorial, then claims alleging exclusively foreign \nconduct may proceed.\u201d Abitron Austria GmbH v. \nHetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 (2023). This is true \n\u201cregardless of whether the particular statute regulates \nconduct, affords relief, or merely confers jurisdiction.\u201d \nRJR Nabisco, Inc. v. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nAnd this Court has been careful, when considering con-\nstraints imposed on the jurisdiction of a State under the \nFourteenth Amendment, to make clear that it was not \nsuggesting that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment imposes the same \nrestrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a \nfederal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 582 U.S. at 269.  \n4. As a result of the rulings below, courts in the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2014and others that have followed suit\u2014now \nroutinely dismiss civil cases brought under other federal \nstatutes involving extraterritorial conduct, notwith-\n\n22 \n \n \nstanding statutory authorization for such suits.3 As Judge \nElrod observed, the law of these Circuits \u201ceffectively neu-\nters Congress of its ability to use our own legal system \nand its well-established rule of law to help right the most \ngrievous wrongs committed against Americans abroad.\u201d \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 278 (dissenting).  \nIn Douglass, for instance, the Fifth Circuit, citing the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s decision here, applied the Fourteenth \nAmendment\u2019s test for personal jurisdiction to suits under \nthe Death on the High Seas Act, which authorizes the per-\nsonal representative of a person who died on the high seas \nto \u201cbring a civil action in admiralty against the person or \nvessel responsible.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u200930302. As a result, claims \nunder that statute are now effectively limited to those \nagainst domestic entities. See Douglass, 46 F.4th at 276-\n277 (Elrod, J., dissenting). Under similar reasoning, the \nEleventh Circuit recently gutted the Helms-Burton Act, \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20096081 et seq., which imposes liability on persons \nwho traffic in U.S. property expropriated by the Castro \nregime. Herederos de Roberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. \nTeck Resources Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th Cir. 2022). \nAn even more striking illustration of the harmful con-\nsequences of conflating the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments\u2019 tests comes from the Second Circuit itself. In a re-\ncent case, the court affirmed the dismissal of a False \nClaims Act complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction be-\ncause the \u201cfraudulent [documents] were signed by [the \nfraudster\u2019s] executives in cities outside of the United \nStates.\u201d United States ex. rel. TZAC, Inc. v. Christian \n \n3 See, e.g., Prime Int\u2019l Trading, Ltd. v. BP P.L.C., 784 Fed.\u2009App\u2019x 4, \n9 (2d Cir. 2019); In re SSA Bonds Antitrust Litig., 420 F.\u2009Supp. 3d \n219, 240\u2013241 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Dennis v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 343 \nF.\u2009Supp.\u20093d 122, 199\u2013207 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Sonterra Cap. Master \nFund Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Grp. AG, 277 F.\u2009Supp.\u20093d 521, 596 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2017). \n\n23 \n \n \nAid, No. 17-cv-4135 (PKC), 2021 WL 2354985, at *4 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2021), aff\u2019d mem. No. 21-1542, 2022 WL \n2165751 (2d Cir. June 16, 2022). Thus, in the Second Cir-\ncuit, even a fraud perpetrated against the United States \nis beyond the judicial power of the United States if the \nfraudster acted abroad. \nUnsurprisingly, the Second Circuit\u2019s position has \nbeen subject to widespread scholarly and judicial criti-\ncism. See, e.g., Sachs, supra, at 1706 (Second Circuit\u2019s ap-\nproach is \u201call backwards\u201d); Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n597-598 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (Rao, J., concurring) (\u201clittle (or \nno) evidence\u201d supporting it); Douglass, 46 F.4th at 263 \n(Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cThis is anachronism.\u201d); id. at 284 \n(Oldham, J., dissenting). \n5. Reverse-incorporating the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s federalism-based limitations into the fundamen-\ntally different Fifth Amendment context also creates in-\ntolerable doctrinal incongruities. As Judge Elrod put it, \ncircuit \u201cprecedents are awash with confusion.\u201d Id., 46 \nF.4th at 282 (Elrod, J., dissenting). \nFirst, the PLO and PA are foreign political entities \naspiring to international statehood; as such, their amena-\nbility to suit in federal court should lie solely in the hands \nof the political branches, not the Judiciary. As the Office \nof Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the PLO purports to \nbe an independent sovereign entity, we have little diffi-\nculty concluding that it falls into [the] category\u201d of entities \nthat \u201cexist outside the constitutional compact and have no \nrights or responsibilities under it.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. 105 \n(1987). The Second Circuit got this backwards, holding \nthat the PLO and PA have due process rights because \nthey are not \u201crecognized by the United States as a sover-\neign state.\u201d App. 94a, 153a. According to the Second Cir-\ncuit, allowing the political branches to subject the PLO \nand PA to suit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d \n\n24 \n \n \nApp. 30a n.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was \nwrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nApp. 238a (citation omitted). Relatedly, because of their \nstatus, the United States has the absolute right to exclude \nthe PLO and PA from its territory. See Palestinian Info. \nOff. v. Shultz, 853 F.2d 932, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Under \nlong-standing case law, the sovereign\u2019s right to exclude \nthese entities includes the less-draconian right to permit \nentry on reasonable conditions, including consent to suit. \nSt. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356; Harris, 79 U.S. at 81. \nSecond, as Judge Elrod has observed, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s rule means that \u201ccivil foreign defendants now \nhave more due process rights than criminal foreign de-\nfendants.\u201d 46 F.4th at 276; accord App. 250a (Menashi, J., \ndissenting). In criminal cases arising from extraterritorial \nconduct, the courts of appeals unanimously exercise juris-\ndiction whenever a defendant caused harm to \u201cU.S. citi-\nzens or interests.\u201d United States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d \n154, 167-168 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). The \nPSJVTA would easily satisfy that test, since it is focused \non acts of terrorism harming a \u201cnational of the United \nStates.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). But the Second Circuit has \nnow imposed a far more stringent requirement for civil \ncases, asserting that the \u201cthe due process test for assert-\ning jurisdiction over extra-territorial criminal conduct \u2026 \ndiffers from the test applicable in [a] civil case.\u201d App. 175a. \n\n25 \n \n \nThat makes no sense. Outside the context of personal \njurisdiction, this Court has sometimes required a stricter \ndue process standard in criminal cases than in civil cases. \nSee, e.g., Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Ad-\ndington v. Texas, 331 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has \nnever suggested that the reverse should be true\u2014that a \nstricter standard might apply in civil cases than in crimi-\nnal cases. How could it be constitutional for the govern-\nment to obtain a sentence of death against a foreign na-\ntional for acts of terrorism committed abroad, but \nunconstitutional for it to seek a civil fine or forfeiture of \nthe same defendant\u2019s property based on the same conduct \nin the same place? Or as Judge Elrod aptly summarized: \n\u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold that allowing a civil lawsuit \nagainst a foreign defendant for foreign conduct violates \ndue process but that a criminal prosecution against the \nsame defendant for the same foreign conduct does not.\u201d \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 270 (dissenting). \nB. The PSJVTA Satisfies Due Process Even Under \nThe Fourteenth Amendment Standard \nEven if the Court were apply the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s due process standard to jurisdictional statutes en-\nacted by Congress, the Second Circuit\u2019s decision to invent \na new due process test and its application of that new test \nwere both indefensible.  \nThe Traditional Due Process Test  \n1. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, exercises of \njurisdiction must provide the defendant with \u201cfair warn-\ning\u201d and must be \u201creasonable, in the context of our federal \nsystem of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. at 358 (ci-\ntations omitted). This parallels the Court\u2019s general under-\nstanding that due process safeguards \u201cfundamental fair-\nness (through notice and fair warning) and the prevention \nof the arbitrary and vindictive use of the laws.\u201d Rogers v. \n\n26 \n \n \nTennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 460 (2001); see Village of Euclid \nv. Amber Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926); Hurtado v. \nCalifornia, 110 U.S. 516, 527 (1884). \nThe PSJVTA easily meets that test. It provides \u201cfair \nwarning,\u201d by specifying the conduct deemed to constitute \nconsent to jurisdiction, and by giving the PLO and PA an \nadvance-warning period. See id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). The stat-\nute also reasonably advances legitimate\u2014indeed, vital\u2014\nfederal interests. Congress enacted the PSJVTA to deter \nand disrupt terrorism; compensate American terror vic-\ntims; and end the PLO and PA\u2019s noxious pay-for-slay pol-\nicy, thereby advancing the prospects for peace in the Mid-\ndle East. See p. 13, supra.  \nThe PSJVTA is thus reasonable within our federal \nsystem. Importantly, \u201cpersonal jurisdiction requires a fo-\nrum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d J. \nMcIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) \n(plurality). In the context of state-court jurisdiction, the \n\u201cfederalism interest may be decisive,\u201d because \u201c[t]he sov-\nereignty of each State implies a limitation on the sover-\neignty of all its sister States.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 \nU.S. at 263. In that context, federalism principles \u201censure \nthat States with little legitimate interest in a suit do not \nencroach on States more affected by the controversy.\u201d \nFord Motor, 592 U.S. at 360 (quotation marks omitted). \nThis case is different. It implicates national interests \nof the United States. The law creates jurisdiction in a lim-\nited category of antiterrorism cases under a federal stat-\nute (the ATA) that involve American citizens and that ad-\nvance federal interests. Such assertions of jurisdiction do \nnot infringe the sovereignty of any other entity within our \nconstitutional framework. Determinations about whether \nand when to subject foreign entities such as these defend-\nants to jurisdiction is a question well within the compe-\ntency and authority of the political branches. See 11 Op. \n\n27 \n \n \nO.L.C. at 108 (\u201cthe political branches may deny foreign \n[political] entities as such all constitutional rights\u201d). \n2.  Rather than apply established due-process stand-\nards, the Second Circuit invented a new due-process test \nfor consent-based jurisdictional statutes. According to the \ncourt, Congress (or a State) cannot enact a consent-based \njurisdictional statute unless the consent is \u201cin exchange \nfor, or as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit \nor privilege.\u201d App. 24a. In the court\u2019s view, this additional \nrequirement ensures that the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d is a suf-\nficiently close \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Ibid. This rea-\nsoning cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s precedents. \nAs this Court explained just last Term, a defendant \nvalidly consents under a jurisdiction-triggering statute if \nthe defendant \u201cappreciated the jurisdictional conse-\nquences attending [its] actions and proceeded anyway.\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality). Deemed-consent stat-\nutes permissibly \u201cadapt the traditional rule about transi-\ntory actions for individuals to artificial persons created by \nlaw\u201d by ensuring that corporate defendants are deemed \nto be \u201cfound\u201d in the State. Id. at 129-130. \nIn Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it had \n\u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction by engaging in a \n\u201cmeaningless formalit[y]\u201d\u2014in that case, designating an \nagent for service of process despite \u201cappreciat[ing] the ju-\nrisdictional consequences\u201d of doing so. Id. at 144. This \nCourt rejected the defendant\u2019s argument: \u201ca legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704-\n\n28 \n \n \n705 (1982)). Justice Alito, whose concurrence formed the \nmajority, agreed: There was no due process violation be-\ncause the defendant \u201cacted with knowledge of state law \nwhen it registered,\u201d such that the Court may \u201cpresume \nthat by registering, it consented to all valid conditions im-\nposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 (cleaned up). That reason-\ning controls here.  \n3. The Second Circuit rejected the relevance of Mal-\nlory on the ground that the statute there gave the defend-\nant \u201ca benefit from the forum in exchange for its amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts.\u201d App. 20a. Judge \nMenashi explained why that is incorrect: \n[A] separate statute treats \u201c \u2018qualification as a foreign \ncorporation\u2019 to be a \u2018sufficient basis\u2019 for Pennsylvania \ncourts \u2018to exercise general personal jurisdiction\u2019 over \nan out-of-state company.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 151 \n(Alito, J.) (quoting 42 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i) (2019)). \nNeither statute indicated that personal jurisdiction \nwas being exchanged for the benefit of operating in \nPennsylvania; the statutes did not even reference \neach other. \nApp. 244a. \nThe ruling below also reflects a basic logic error. \nWhile \u201caccepting an in-state benefit with jurisdictional \nstrings attached\u201d is one way to consent to personal juris-\ndiction, Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality), this Court has \nnever suggested it is the only way. To the contrary, even \na \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone step\u201d across an \u201cinvisible \nstate line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdictional consequences [that] \nare immediate and serious.\u201d Ibid. Or as Justice Jackson \nexplained, a defendant may consent to jurisdiction \u201cmore \nthan one way,\u201d including: (1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly con-\nsenting,\u201d by engaging in conduct deemed consent under \nlaw; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to follow specific procedural rules\u201d; \nor (3) by \u201cvoluntarily invoking certain benefits from a \n\n29 \n \n \nState that are conditioned on submitting to the State\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. The Second Circuit simply \nerased the first category. That was incorrect. As Justice \nJackson explained: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction rights expressly or construc-\ntively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. of Ire-\nland is the same: When a defendant chooses to en-\ngage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148. \nApplication Of The Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cReciprocity\u201d Test  \n1. As Judge Menashi pointed out, even if a reciprocal \n\u201cbenefit\u201d were required, the PLO and PA received one, \n\u201cbecause the defendants are deemed to have consented \nbased on the privilege of residing and conducting business \nin the United States\u2014not to mention furthering their po-\nlitical goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d App. 231a. \nThe Second Circuit observed that PLO and PA \u201cdo not \ndispute they have engaged in these types of activities.\u201d \nApp. 73a.  \nIt is uncontested that after the statutory trigger date, \ndefendants continued their pay-for-slay programs, and \nthat their U.S.-based officers, employees, and agents con-\nducted extensive domestic activities, such as: notarizing \ndocuments in the United States, as a part of a certification \nprocess for use by defendants\u2019 agencies; meeting with \nU.S.-based groups to encourage them to \u201clobby[] the gov-\nernment, lobby[] Congress\u201d to support \u201cjustice for the \nPalestinian people\u201d; and using U.S.-based social media \nplatforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d and \u201cbring atten-\ntion\u201d to their cause. Sokolow D.Ct. Dkt. 1057 at 6-11. The \n\n30 \n \n \nPLO and PA\u2019s ability to engage in these activities while \nphysically present in the United States was a meaningful \nbenefit. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 637 \n(1990) (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant received \u201csig-\nnificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for three days). \n2. The Second Circuit dismissed defendants\u2019 U.S.-\nbased conduct as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfed-\neral law has long prohibited the PLO and PA from engag-\ning in any activities or maintaining any offices in the \nUnited States.\u201d App. 28a. As a result, the court said, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d App. 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was simply incorrect that \nthe PLO and PA\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct was \nprohibited by federal law. The relevant statute forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; see Application of the Anti-Ter-\nrorism Act of 1987 to Diplomatic Visit of Palestinian Del-\negation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __ (slip op. Oct 28, 2022). Their non-\nexpenditure activities\u2014including notarizing documents, \nholding meetings, and issuing public statements\u2014are not \nillegal. See App. 251a (Menashi, J., dissenting) (\u201cAt least \nwith respect to the PA, most such activities do not appear \nto be prohibited.\u201d). \nBut even if all their U.S.-based conduct were prohib-\nited, that would only make the PSJVTA more reasonable, \nnot less. As Judge Menashi explained, \u201c[t]he fact that the \nPLO and the PA extracted a benefit from the United \nStates in violation of the law\u2014and additionally benefited \nfrom the federal government\u2019s nonenforcement of the \nlaw\u2014does not alter the fact that those organizations re-\nceived the benefit from the forum that the statute envi-\nsions.\u201d App. 250a. Indeed, \u201ca foreign actor that conducts \nunauthorized business in the United States has obtained \n\n31 \n \n \nan even greater benefit from the forum than the foreign \nactor that complies with American law,\u201d App. 250a, and it \nwould be \u201cperverse\u201d to give the law-breaker protection \nthat a law-abiding foreigner does not get, App. 231a. \nTo drive the point home, consider an analogous con-\nsent statute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent \nlaws that require motorists, as a condition of operating a \nmotor vehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol \ncontent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained \non suspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cbenefits\u201d test, these implied-consent statues would \nbe constitutional only as applied to validly licensed drivers \nwho exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege of driving on \nstate roads.\u201d App. 37a n.14 (citation omitted). They would \nbe unconstitutional as applied to motorists whose li-\ncenses have been suspended or revoked, because such \npersons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driving under ex-\nisting law. No principle of due process imposes such irra-\ntional limits on the political branches.  \nIII. THESE CASES PRESENT AN IDEAL VEHICLE FOR \nRESOLVING THE ISSUES PRESENTED \nThese cases (consolidated by the court of appeals) are \nan ideal vehicle, both for considering the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutionality and for resolving long-reserved questions \nabout Congress\u2019s authority under the Fifth Amendment. \nThey present the legal issues squarely and cleanly. The \nPSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality\u2014including the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment constrains Congress\u2019s au-\nthority to create personal jurisdiction in the same manner \nthat the Fourteenth Amendment constrains the States\u2014\nwas raised and thoroughly briefed by all parties, including \nthe Government, which intervened in both cases. As for \nthe facts, the PLO and PA did not contest below the gran-\nular and expansive factual showing that they engaged in \n\n32 \n \n \nspecified conduct such as paying the families of convicted \nor \u201cmartyred\u201d terrorists and conducting U.S.-based activ-\nities. The district courts and the Second Circuit all as-\nsumed for purposes of their rulings that both of the stat-\nute\u2019s prongs were satisfied. App. 38a, 87a-90a, 108a-124a. \nThe legal issues were also outcome-determinative in \nboth cases. In Sokolow, petitioners prevailed on the mer-\nits of their ATA claims after a seven-week trial, and the \njury\u2019s verdict and corresponding judgment were thrown \nout solely on the basis of personal jurisdiction. In Fuld, \nthe district court dismissed the complaint for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.  \nFinally, there is no reason to postpone review of the \nquestion whether due process constrains Congress under \nthe Fifth Amendment the same way that it constrains the \nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment. The percola-\ntion recommended by the Government in 2018 has led to \nextensive opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the Sec-\nond, Fifth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits.

The Government, as interve-\nnor in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 5.1(c), also appeals from that judg-\nment.

The Government, as in-\ntervenor in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 5.1(c), also appeals from the \njudgment. \nAt issue in this appeal is the constitutionality of the \nPromoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 \nStat. 2534, 3082, the federal statute on which the plaintiffs \nrelied to allege personal jurisdiction over the defendants. \nThe PSJVTA was enacted for the precise purpose of pre-\nventing dismissals based on lack of personal jurisdiction in \ncases just like this one \u2014 civil actions against the PLO and \nthe PA pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333, which provides a damages remedy for \n\n5a \n \nUnited States nationals injured \u201cby reason of an act of in-\nternational terrorism,\u201d id. \u00a7 2333(a). \nCongress crafted the PSJVTA in response to a series \nof judicial decisions, all arising out of civil ATA cases re-\nlated to terrorist activity abroad, which held that federal \ncourts had no general or specific personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA. The resulting statute reflects a leg-\nislative effort to create personal jurisdiction over those en-\ntities based on alleged consent, which, when validly given, \nmay constitute an independent constitutional basis for \nsubjecting a nonresident defendant to litigation in a par-\nticular forum. The PSJVTA specifically provides that the \nPLO and the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction in [any] civil [ATA] action,\u201d irrespec-\ntive of \u201cthe date of the occurrence of the act of interna-\ntional terrorism\u201d at issue, upon engaging in certain forms \nof post-enactment conduct, namely (1) making payments, \ndirectly or indirectly, to the designees or families of incar-\ncerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, whose acts of \nterror injured or killed a United States national, or (2) un-\ndertaking any activities within the United States, subject \nto a handful of exceptions. Id. \u00a7 2334(e). \nThe district court determined that this \u201cdeemed con-\nsent\u201d provision was an unconstitutional attempt to create \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants where none ex-\nisted, and it accordingly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 civil ATA \naction for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(2). Both the plaintiffs \nand the Government (together, \u201cappellants\u201d) challenge \nthat conclusion on appeal, arguing principally that the ex-\nercise of this \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction under the \nPSJVTA satisfies the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause. \n\n6a \n \nWe conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is inconsistent \nwith the requirements of constitutional due process. Ac-\ncordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dis-\nmissing this case. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nThe plaintiffs are the widowed spouse and children of \nAri Yoel Fuld, a United States citizen who was fatally \nstabbed during a September 2018 terrorist attack outside \na shopping mall in the West Bank. In the aftermath of \nFuld\u2019s death, the plaintiffs commenced this action against \nthe PLO and the PA, alleging that these defendants had \n\u201cencouraged, incentivized, and assisted\u201d the nonparty who \ncommitted the attack on Fuld. Am. Compl. \u00b6 4. The PA, \nestablished in 1993 pursuant to the Oslo Accords, is the \nnon-sovereign and interim governing body of parts of the \nGaza Strip and the West Bank (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d). The PLO, an entity founded in 1964, \nconducts Palestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Per-\nmanent Observer to the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) on behalf \nof the Palestinian people. The plaintiffs seek monetary re-\nlief from both defendants pursuant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333, which, as relevant here, provides United States na-\ntionals \u201cinjured . . . by reason of an act of international ter-\nrorism\u201d with a civil damages remedy against \u201cany person \nwho aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial as-\nsistance [to],\u201d the perpetrator of the attack. Id. \u00a7 2333(a), \n(d)(2). \nSeveral years before these plaintiffs initiated their \ncase, and prior to the passage of the PSJVTA, this Court \ndecided Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Organization, \n835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert denied sub \nnom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization, 138 \nS. Ct. 1438 (2018) (mem.), which arose out of litigation \n\n7a \n \ninvolving civil ATA claims similar in key respects to those \nasserted here.1 The Waldman plaintiffs, a group of United \nStates citizens injured or killed during terror attacks in \nIsrael and the estates or survivors of such citizens, sued \nthe PLO and the PA for money damages pursuant to the \nATA, alleging that the defendants had provided material \nsupport to the nonparties who carried out the attacks. Af-\nter more than a decade of litigation and a substantial jury \nverdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the defendants filed their \nappeal in this Court, where they reasserted their \nlongstanding objection that the claims against them \nshould be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. \nThis Court ultimately agreed with the defendants, \nconcluding that dismissal was required because, notwith-\nstanding the \u201cunquestionably horrific\u201d nature of the at-\ntacks underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, \u201c[t]he district court \ncould not constitutionally exercise either general or spe-\ncific personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d Waldman \nI, 835 F.3d at 344. We explained, as a threshold matter, \nthat while sovereign governments lack due process rights, \n\u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is recognized by the United \nStates as a sovereign state,\u201d and accordingly, both defend-\nants are entitled to due process protections. Id. at 329. \nMoreover, we noted that our precedents established that \nthe \u201cdue process analysis\u201d in the personal jurisdiction con-\ntext \u201cis basically the same under both the Fifth and Four-\nteenth Amendments,\u201d except that \u201cunder the Fifth \nAmendment the court can consider the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts throughout the United States, while under the \n \n1 The procedural history of the Waldman litigation (captioned \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 04-cv-397 \n(S.D.N.Y.) in the district court) is set forth in greater detail in Wald-\nman v. Palestine Liberation Organization,    F.4th   , No. 15- 3135 (2d \nCir. Sept. 8, 2023) (\u201cWaldman III\u201d) (per curiam), which we also decide \ntoday. \n\n8a \n \nFourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the forum \nstate may be considered.\u201d Id. at 330 (quoting Chew v. Die-\ntrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998)). \nWith these background principles in mind, we con-\ncluded that the district court lacked general personal ju-\nrisdiction over the defendants \u201cpursuant to the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s recent decision\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 \nU.S. 117 (2014), because neither defendant\u2019s contacts with \nthe forum were \u201cso constant and pervasive as to render [it] \nessentially at home\u201d in the United States. Waldman I, 835 \nF.3d at 331, 335 (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. at 122). We \nrejected the notion that the defendants could be consid-\nered \u201cessentially at home\u201d in this country based on their \nactivities in Washington, D.C., which were \u201climited to \nmaintaining an office [there], promoting the Palestinian \ncause in speeches and media appearances, and retaining a \nlobbying firm.\u201d Id. at 333. Rather, both the PLO and the \nPA \u201care \u2018at home\u2019 in Palestine, where these entities are \nheadquartered and from where they are directed.\u201d Id. at \n334 (citing Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139 n.20). \nThis Court likewise held that the district court could \nnot properly exercise specific personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA, in view of the absence of any \u201csub-\nstantial connection\u201d between \u201cthe defendants\u2019 suit-related \nconduct \u2014 their role in the six terror attacks at issue \u2014 \n[and] . . . the forum.\u201d Id. at 335 (citing Walden v. Fiore, 571 \nU.S. 277, 284 (2014)). We explained that the terrorist at-\ntacks themselves took place outside the United States, \nthat \u201cthe defendants\u2019 [related] activities in violation of the \nATA occurred outside the United States,\u201d and that none \nof these acts were \u201cspecifically targeted\u201d or \u201cexpressly \naimed\u201d at the United States. Id. at 335, 337\u201338. Indeed, \nthe attacks in question were \u201crandom,\u201d such that they \u201caf-\nfected United States citizens only because [those citizens] \n\n9a \n \nwere victims of indiscriminate violence . . . abroad.\u201d Id. at \n337. Thus, the actions for which the defendants had been \nsued \u201cwere not sufficiently connected to the United States \nto provide specific personal jurisdiction,\u201d and the \u201climits \nprescribed by [constitutional] due process\u201d required that \nthe case be dismissed. Id. at 337, 344. In a series of com-\nparable cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit reached the same conclusions. \nSee Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 54\u201358 (D.C. \nCir. 2017) (concluding, in a civil ATA case arising out of \noverseas terror attacks, that exercising general or specific \njurisdiction over the PA would not \u201cmeet the require-\nments of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause\u201d), \ncert. denied, 139 U.S. 373 (2018) (mem.); see also Shatsky \nv.

Cir. 2020) (mem.). \nCongress responded to Waldman I and similar deci-\nsions with federal legislation known as the Anti-Terrorism \nClarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183, which modified an existing ATA provision, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334, to include a new subsection (e) concern-\ning the \u201c[c]onsent of certain parties to personal jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d See ATCA \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. at 3184. This new subsection \nprovided that \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of \nthe act of international terrorism upon which [a] civil ac-\ntion [pursuant to the ATA] was filed,\u201d a defendant would \n\u201cbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nsuch civil action if,\u201d after more than 120 days following the \nATCA\u2019s enactment, the defendant (1) \u201caccept[ed]\u201d certain \n\u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from the United States, or (2) \n\u201cmaintain[ed]\u201d an office \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the \n\n10a \n \nUnited States\u201d while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspen-\nsion\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, a statutory provision expressly \nbarring the PLO from operating any such office. ATCA \n\u00a7 4, 132 Stat. at 3184. \nBefore the expiration of the 120-day period, both the \nPLO and the PA formally terminated their acceptance of \nany relevant assistance from the United States, and the \nPLO shuttered its diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. \n\u2014 its only office operating in the United States pursuant \nto a waiver of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2502.2 See Klieman, 923 F.3d at \n1128\u201330. \nThis Court subsequently denied a motion to recall the \nmandate in Waldman I based on the ATCA, because nei-\nther of the statute\u2019s \u201cfactual predicates\u201d for personal ju-\nrisdiction could be satisfied. Waldman v. Palestine Liber-\nation Org., 925 F.3d 570, 574\u201375 (2d Cir. 2019) (\u201cWaldman \n \n2 The PLO had previously maintained this Washington, D.C. office \npursuant to an express waiver of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, which expired \naround the time of the office\u2019s closure. At that point, no waivers or \nsuspensions of this provision remained in effect. See Klieman, 923 \nF.3d at 1130. The PLO has continued to operate its UN Permanent \nObserver Mission in New York, but it does so without any need for a \nwaiver or suspension of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, which forbids the PLO from \n\u201cmaintain[ing] an office . . . within the jurisdiction of the United \nStates.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202(3); see Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1129\u201330.

Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020) (mem.). Around the same time, the D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals made a similar finding. See Klieman, 923 \nF.3d at 1128 (dismissing ATA claims against the PLO and \nthe PA for lack of personal jurisdiction and explaining, in \nrelevant part, that the ATCA\u2019s \u201cfactual predicates\u201d had \nnot been \u201ctriggered\u201d). \nWhile petitions for writs of certiorari from Waldman \nII and Klieman were pending, Congress stepped in again, \nthis time enacting the PSJVTA on December 20, 2019. See \nPub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082 (2019). \nSection 903(c) of the PSJVTA superseded the relevant \nportions of the ATCA, resulting in various amendments to \nthe personal jurisdiction provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).3 \n133 Stat. at 3083\u201385. Those amendments included a nar-\nrowed definition of the term \u201cdefendant,\u201d which now re-\nfers exclusively to the PLO, the PA, and any \u201csucces-\nsor[s]\u201d or \u201caffiliate[s]\u201d thereof. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). In \ndrafting the PSJVTA, Congress also specified new post-\nenactment conduct that would be \u201cdeemed\u201d to constitute \n\u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction in \u201cany civil action\u201d un-\nder the ATA, \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of \nthe act of international terrorism upon which such civil ac-\ntion was filed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nAs amended pursuant to the PSJVTA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1) includes two subparagraphs that list the \n \n3 The PSJVTA also includes a number of additional provisions, but \nonly the jurisdictional amendments of \u00a7 903(c) are at issue in this case. \nWe do not pass on the constitutionality of any portion of the PSJVTA \nother than \u00a7 903(c). However, for purposes of clarity, this opinion re-\nfers to \u00a7 903(c) as the PSJVTA, which is consistent with the nomen-\nclature used in the district court\u2019s decision and the parties\u2019 briefs on \nappeal. \n\n12a \n \ncircumstances under which \u201ca defendant shall be deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in a civil ATA \ncase. Subparagraph (A) provides, first, that a defendant \n\u201cshall be deemed to have consented\u201d to such jurisdiction \nif, \u201cafter . . . 120 days\u201d following the enactment of the \nPSJVTA (that is, after April 18, 2020), the defendant \n\u201cmakes any payment, directly or indirectly\u201d: \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, af-\nter being fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been \nimprisoned for committing any act of terrorism \nthat injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of such \nimprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, following \nsuch individual's death while committing an act of \nterrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason \nof the death of such individual. \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). This subparagraph refers, in the words \nof other federal legislation on the subject, to a \u201cpractice of \npaying salaries to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons[] \n[and] to the families of deceased terrorists,\u201d Taylor Force \nAct, Pub. L. No. 115-141, \u00a7 1002, 132 Stat. 348, 1143 (2018), \nwhich Congress has previously condemned as \u201can incen-\ntive to commit acts of terror.\u201d Id. \nSubparagraph (B) of the PSJVTA provides that \u201ca de-\nfendant shall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d in a civil ATA action if, \u201cafter 15 days\u201d following \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s enactment (that is, after January 4, 2020), \nthe defendant \u201ccontinues to maintain,\u201d \u201cestablishes,\u201d or \n\u201cprocures any office, headquarters, premises, or other fa-\ncilities or establishments in the United States,\u201d or other-\nwise \u201cconducts any activity while physically present in the \nUnited States on behalf of the [PLO] or the [PA].\u201d 18 \n\n13a \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The PSJVTA exempts \u201ccertain ac-\ntivities and locations\u201d from the reach of subparagraph (B), \nincluding facilities and activities devoted \u201cexclusively [to] \nthe purpose of conducting official business of the United \nNations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(A)\u2013(B), specified activities re-\nlated to engagements with United States officials or legal \nrepresentation, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(C)\u2013(E), and any \u201cpersonal \nor official activities conducted ancillary to activities listed\u201d \nin these exceptions, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(F). \nThe PSJVTA includes a \u201crule[] of construction,\u201d \nwhich provides that the legislation\u2019s terms \u201cshould be lib-\nerally construed to carry out the purposes of Congress to \nprovide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d PSJVTA \n\u00a7 903(d)(1)(A), 133 Stat. at 3085. Congress also specified \nthat the PSJVTA \u201cshall apply to any case pending on or \nafter August 30, 2016,\u201d id. \u00a7 903(d)(2), 133 Stat. at 3085, \nreferring to the date just one day before this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Waldman I. \nOn April 27, 2020, several months after the PSJVTA\u2019s \nenactment, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in \nWaldman II and Klieman, vacated both judgments, and \nremanded the cases \u201cfor further consideration in light of \nthe [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714; see Klieman, \n140 S. Ct. at 2713. Three days later, on April 30, 2020, the \nplaintiffs commenced this action. The plaintiffs invoked \nthe PSJVTA as the sole basis for personal jurisdiction, and \ntheir amended complaint alleged that both prongs of the \nstatute\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision had been satisfied. \nWith respect to the first prong, the plaintiffs alleged that, \nafter April 18, 2020, the defendants continued an existing \npractice of making payments to (1) the designees of incar-\ncerated terrorists who were fairly convicted of attacks that \nkilled or injured United States nationals, and (2) the fam-\nilies of deceased terrorists who died while committing \n\n14a \n \nattacks that killed or injured United States nationals. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). For the second prong, the plain-\ntiffs alleged that, after January 4, 2020, the defendants (1) \nused an office maintained in the United States, namely \ntheir UN Permanent Observer Mission in New York City, \nfor purposes other than official UN business, and (2) en-\ngaged in various activities on their own behalf while in the \nUnited States, including providing consular services, hold-\ning press conferences, and publishing various online and \nprint materials designed to influence American foreign \npolicy. See id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and the PA moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 \namended complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfor failure to state a claim, pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), respectively. In con-\nnection with their Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the defendants \nchallenged the constitutionality of the PSJVTA, arguing \nthat the statute\u2019s provision for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to per-\nsonal jurisdiction violated due process requirements. The \ndistrict court certified this constitutional challenge to the \nUnited States Attorney General, and the Government in-\ntervened in the action to defend the PSJVTA. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1. \nIn a January 6, 2022 decision, the district court \ngranted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss on \nthe ground that it could not validly exercise personal ju-\nrisdiction under the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., 578 F. Supp. \n3d 577, 580, 596 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). The court noted at the \noutset that \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent, \nwhether express or implied,\u201d can serve as an \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d basis for personal jurisdiction, separate and apart \nfrom \u201cgeneral jurisdiction[] . . . [and] specific jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 579. Moreover, the court observed that the PLO and \n\n15a \n \nthe PA did \u201cnot dispute\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they \nhad made payments triggering the PSJVTA\u2019s first \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d prong.4 Id. at 583. Nevertheless, the \ndistrict court concluded that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the \nPSJVTA could not \u201cconstitutionally provide for personal \njurisdiction over [the] [d]efendants.\u201d Id. at 587. The court \nreasoned that the predicate activities under the PSJVTA \ndo not \u201ceven remotely signal[] approval or acceptance of,\u201d \nor an \u201cinten[t] to submit to,\u201d jurisdiction in the United \nStates, id. (internal quotation marks omitted), that the \nstatute \u201cpush[es] the concept of consent well beyond its \nbreaking point,\u201d id. at 595, and that \u201clegislature[s] [can-\nnot] simply create [personal] jurisdiction out of whole \ncloth by deeming any conduct [whatsoever] to be \u2018con-\nsent,\u2019\u201d id. at 580. In short, the district court concluded that \n\u201cdeemed consent jurisdiction\u201d under the PSJVTA is not \n\u201cconsistent with the requirements of due process,\u201d and ac-\ncordingly, the action had to be dismissed for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe district court entered final judgment on January \n7, 2022. Both the plaintiffs and the Government timely ap-\npealed. \n \n4 The defendants did, however, \u201ccontest [the] [p]laintiffs\u2019 allegations \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s second \u2018deemed consent\u2019 prong ha[d] been met.\u201d \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583 n.3. The defendants argued that to the \nextent they had conducted activities within the United States after the \nrelevant post-enactment date, all of those activities fell within the ex-\nceptions for UN-related undertakings and \u201cancillary\u201d conduct. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). In light of its finding that \u201cthe PSJVTA\u2019s first \nprong ha[d] been met,\u201d the district court declined to consider \n\u201cwhether [the] [d]efendants\u2019 conduct also implicate[d] the second \nprong.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583 n.3. It is also unnecessary to ad-\ndress that question on this appeal. \n\n16a \n \nII. DISCUSSION \nWe review the dismissal of a complaint for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction de novo, construing the pleadings in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs and resolving all \ndoubts in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. V&A Collection, LLC v. \nGuzzini Props. Ltd., 46 F.4th 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2022). Like-\nwise, we review de novo questions of law, including chal-\nlenges to the constitutionality of a statute. United States \nv. Wasylyshyn, 979 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 2020). \n\u201cBefore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover a defendant, three requirements must be met: (1) \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019s service of process upon the defendant must have \nbeen procedurally proper\u2019; (2) \u2018there must be a statutory \nbasis for personal jurisdiction that renders such service of \nprocess effective\u2019; and (3) \u2018the exercise of personal juris-\ndiction must comport with constitutional due process prin-\nciples.\u2019\u201d Schwab Short-Term Bond Mkt. Fund v. Lloyds \nBanking Grp. PLC, 22 F.4th 103, 121 (2d Cir. 2021) (quot-\ning Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 327\u201328). In this case, the par-\nties do not dispute that the first and second requirements \nwere waived and satisfied, respectively.5 See Fuld, 578 F. \nSupp. 3d at 583. We therefore consider only the third re-\nquirement \u2014 \u201cwhether jurisdiction over the defendants \nmay be exercised consistent with the Constitution.\u201d Wald-\nman I, 835 F.3d at 328. \nThe principle that a court must have personal juris-\ndiction over a defendant \u201crecognizes and protects an indi-\nvidual liberty interest\u201d flowing from the Constitution\u2019s \nguarantees of due process. Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \n \n5 Specifically, the defendants \u201cwaived any defenses regarding proper \nservice of process,\u201d and with respect to the second requirement, the \ndefendants do not dispute that they \u201cmade payments\u201d sufficient to \nsatisfy the PSJVTA\u2019s first statutory prong for \u201cdeemed consent.\u201d \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583. \n\n17a \n \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 \n(1982). As we explained in Waldman I, that principle ex-\ntends to both the PLO and the PA, each of whom enjoys a \ndue process right \u201cto be subject only to [a court\u2019s] lawful \npower.\u201d 835 F.3d at 328\u201329 (citing J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. \nv. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion)). \nIn particular, constitutional due process ensures that a \ncourt will exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nonly if \u201cthe maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tradi-\ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Int\u2019l \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting \nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). The Supreme \nCourt\u2019s precedents discussing that requirement, including \nits canonical opinion in International Shoe, have arisen \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment \u2014 a constraint on the power of state tribunals. See \nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; see also Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 \nU.S. at 311. But we have previously explained that the per-\nsonal jurisdiction analysis is \u201cbasically the same\u201d under \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which limits \nthe power of the federal courts and governs the inquiry \nhere.6 Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see U.S. CONST. amend. V. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized three distinct ba-\nses for exercising personal jurisdiction over an out-of-fo-\nrum defendant in accordance with the dictates of due pro-\ncess: general jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction, and con-\nsent. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. \n \n6 As noted above, the \u201cprincipal difference\u201d between these due pro-\ncess standards arises in the context of a minimum-contacts inquiry: \nthe analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment is limited to the de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state, while the Fifth Amendment \npermits consideration of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the United \nStates as a whole. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330 (citing Chew, 143 F.3d \nat 28 n.4). \n\n18a \n \n462, 472\u201373 & 472 n.14 (1985); J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. \nat 880\u201381 (plurality opinion). The first two bases, \u201cgeneral \n(sometimes called all-purpose) jurisdiction and specific \n(sometimes called case-linked) jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cgiv[e] con-\ntent\u201d to the holding of International Shoe, which estab-\nlished that a court may hear claims against a defendant \nwho has not submitted to its authority only where the de-\nfendant has certain \u201ccontacts\u201d with the forum. Ford Motor \nCo. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 \n(2021); see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. \nBrown, 564 U.S. 915, 923\u2013 24 (2011); Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. \nat 316. General jurisdiction, as its name suggests, allows a \ncourt to hear \u201cany and all claims\u201d against a defendant \u2014 \nbut, for businesses and organizations, only when that de-\nfendant is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in the forum. Ford, 141 S. \nCt. at 1024 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919); see Daim-\nler, 571 U.S. at 127. Specific jurisdiction, in contrast, co-\nvers a \u201cnarrower class of claims,\u201d Ford, 141 S. Ct. at 1024, \nand depends \u201con the relationship among the defendant, \nthe forum, and the litigation,\u201d Walden, 571 U.S. at 284 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). In particular, a court \nmay exercise specific jurisdiction if the defendant has \n\u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting \nactivities within the forum,\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 253 (1958), or if the defendant has intentionally di-\nrected wrongdoing at the forum, Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. \n783, 790 (1984). Even then, the court\u2019s authority is limited \nsolely to claims that \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d the defend-\nant\u2019s forum contacts. Ford, 141 S. Ct. at 1025 (quoting \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. \n255, 262 (2017)); see Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472\u201373. \nNeither of those two bases for personal jurisdiction is \nat issue here. In the proceedings before the district court, \nthe plaintiffs never argued for general or specific jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and the PA. Nor do they contest the \n\n19a \n \ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]ny such argument \nwould be foreclosed by . . . Waldman I.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. \n3d at 584. Instead, the plaintiffs rely exclusively on con-\nsent, the third independent basis for exercising personal \njurisdiction over an out-of-forum defendant. See Ins. Corp. \nof Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472 \n& n.14. The plaintiffs contend that the PLO and the PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nthis civil ATA action pursuant to the PSJVTA, because en-\ngaging in the statute\u2019s predicate conduct amounts to \u201cim-\nplied\u201d or \u201cconstructive\u201d consent. See, e.g., Pls.\u2019 Br. at 13. \nBoth the plaintiffs and the Government argue that the \nPSJVTA establishes consent-based jurisdiction in accord-\nance with due process principles, and that the district \ncourt erred in holding otherwise. \nWe disagree. For the reasons set forth below, we con-\nclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision is in-\nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Because the statute does not establish a fed-\neral court\u2019s authority over the PLO and the PA consistent \nwith the Fifth Amendment\u2019s requirement of due process, \nthis case against those defendants was properly dismissed \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. \nA. \nConsent to personal jurisdiction is a voluntary agree-\nment on the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular \nforum. See Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n311, 316 (1964) (a defendant \u201cmay agree . . . to submit to \nthe jurisdiction of a given court\u201d); J. McIntyre Mach., 564 \nU.S. at 880\u201381 (plurality opinion) (\u201cexplicit consent\u201d is \namong the \u201ccircumstances, or . . . course[s] of conduct, \nfrom which it is proper to infer . . . an intention to submit \nto the laws of the forum\u201d); Knowlton v. Allied Van Lines, \nInc., 900 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1990) (\u201cA defendant may \n\n20a \n \nvoluntarily consent or submit to the jurisdiction of a court \nwhich otherwise would not have jurisdiction over it.\u201d). In \nseveral of its decisions, including, most recently, Mallory \nv. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 143 S. Ct. 2028 (2023), \nthe Supreme Court has explained why such consent suf-\nfices to establish personal jurisdiction: \u201cBecause the [due \nprocess] requirement of personal jurisdiction [is] first of \nall an individual right, it can, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; see Burger \nKing, 471 U.S. at 472 n.14 (\u201c[T]he personal jurisdiction re-\nquirement is a waivable right[.]\u201d); Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at \n2043 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is a per-\nsonal defense that may be waived or forfeited.\u201d (emphasis \nin original)); id. at 2051 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment) (\u201cIf a person voluntarily \nwaives th[e] [personal jurisdiction] right, that choice \nshould be honored.\u201d). Thus, when a defendant has validly \nconsented to personal jurisdiction, a court may exercise \nauthority over that defendant in conformity with the Due \nProcess Clause, even in the absence of general or specific \njurisdiction. See, e.g., Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2039 (plurality \nopinion) (explaining that \u201cconsent can . . . ground personal \njurisdiction\u201d apart from a defendant\u2019s forum contacts (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted)); see also Knowlton, 900 \nF.2d at 1199. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a \u201cvariety of legal \narrangements [that] have been taken to represent express \nor implied consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; see \nMallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2038 n.5 (majority opinion). For ex-\nample, a defendant\u2019s consent to personal jurisdiction may \nbe implied based on litigation-related conduct, or where a \ndefendant accepts a benefit from the forum in exchange \nfor its amenability to suit in the forum\u2019s courts. See, e.g., \nIns. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201305; Mallory, 143 S. \n\n21a \n \nCt. at 2033 (majority opinion); id. at 2041 n.8 (plurality \nopinion). In such cases, it is often fair and reasonable to \ninfer the defendant\u2019s voluntary agreement to submit itself \nto a court\u2019s authority. But consent cannot be found based \nsolely on a government decree pronouncing that activities \nunrelated to being sued in the forum will be \u201cdeemed\u201d to \nbe \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction there. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); \ncf. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 (distinguishing \nbetween litigation-related conduct that establishes per-\nsonal jurisdiction and \u201cmere assertions of . . . power\u201d over \na defendant (quoting Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 \nU.S. 25, 29 (1917))). A prospective defendant\u2019s activities do \nnot signify consent to personal jurisdiction simply because \nCongress has labeled them as such. \nThus, while \u201c[a] variety of legal arrangements . . . \n[may] represent . . . consent to . . . personal jurisdiction,\u201d \nid. at 703, the PSJVTA is not among them. The PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision for consent-based jurisdiction over the PLO and \nthe PA, in which Congress has \u201cdeemed\u201d the continuation \nof certain conduct to constitute \u201cconsent,\u201d falls outside any \nreasonable construction of valid consent to proceed in a \nparticular forum\u2019s courts. \n1. \nWe begin with some of the \u201cvarious ways\u201d in which \n\u201cconsent may be manifested,\u201d either \u201cby word or [by] \ndeed.\u201d Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2039 (plurality opinion). It is \nwell-established that a defendant may expressly consent \nto personal jurisdiction in a particular court by contract, \nusually through an agreed-upon forum-selection clause. \nSee Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201304; see also Szu-\nkhent, 375 U.S. at 316 (\u201c[P]arties to a contract may agree \nin advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court.\u201d). \nSo long as such \u201cforum-selection provisions have been ob-\ntained through \u2018freely negotiated\u2019 agreements and are not \n\n22a \n \n\u2018unreasonable and unjust,\u2019 their enforcement [against a \ndefendant] does not offend due process.\u201d Burger King, 471 \nU.S. at 472 n.14 (quoting Bremen v. Zapata Off- Shore Co., \n407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972)); see also Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. \nv. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991) (\u201c[F]orum selection \nclauses . . . are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental \nfairness.\u201d). Likewise, a court may exercise authority over \na defendant on the basis of express consent provided in a \nstipulation. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704; \nPetrowski v. Hawkeye-Sec. Co., 350 U.S. 495, 496 (1956) \n(per curiam) (\u201c[The] respondent, by its stipulation, waived \nany right to assert a lack of personal jurisdiction over it.\u201d). \nThe Supreme Court has acknowledged that a defend-\nant may, in certain circumstances, impliedly consent to \npersonal jurisdiction through litigation- related conduct. \nSee, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201305. Such \nconduct includes a defendant\u2019s voluntary in-court appear-\nance, see id. at 703, unless the defendant has appeared for \nthe limited purpose of contesting personal jurisdiction (in \nwhich case, the defendant typically preserves the de-\nfense), see Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2044 (plurality opinion). \nMoreover, in keeping with the principle that \u201c[t]he expres-\nsion of legal rights is often subject to certain procedural \nrules,\u201d a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow [such] rules\u201d with \nregard to personal jurisdiction may \u201cresult in a curtail-\nment of [its] right[]\u201d to enforce that requirement. Ins. \nCorp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705. \u201cThus, the failure to en-\nter a timely objection to personal jurisdiction constitutes, \nunder Rule 12(h)(1), a waiver of the objection.\u201d Id. Simi-\nlarly, a defendant\u2019s failure to comply with certain pretrial \norders concerning jurisdictional discovery may justify a \n\u201csanction under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) consisting of a finding of \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court has found \nthat other litigation activities can subject a litigant to \n\n23a \n \npersonal jurisdiction as well. See, e.g., id. at 704; Leman v. \nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U.S. 448, 451 (1932).7  \nThe Supreme Court has also recognized that a pro-\nspective defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction \nif it has accepted a government benefit from the forum, in \n \n7 Among these other examples, the only instances in which findings \nof \u201cimplied consent\u201d have been premised on a defendant\u2019s omission \nare those where the defendant \u201cfail[ed] to follow\u201d litigation rules and \norders related to personal jurisdiction, Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. \nat 703, 705, and thereby \u201cforfeited\u201d \u2014 rather than waived \u2014 the de-\nfense. See, e.g., City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 \nF.3d 114, 133\u201334, 135 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction . . . can . . . \nbe purposely waived or inadvertently forfeited. . . . [A] defendant for-\nfeits its jurisdictional defense if it appears before a district court to \npress that defense but then willfully withdraws from the litigation and \ndefaults[.]\u201d); Hamilton v. Atlas Turner, Inc., 197 F.3d 58, 61\u201362 (2d \nCir. 1999) (\u201cWhereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely as-\nsertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandon-\nment of a known right. . . . [The defendant] participated in pretrial \nproceedings but never moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion despite several clear opportunities to do so during the four-year \ninterval after filing its answer. These circumstances establish a forfei-\nture.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). It can be said \nthat in failing to follow such rules or orders, a defendant effectively \nconcedes the issue. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705, 709 \n(where noncompliance with litigation rules and orders supports a \n\u201cpresumption of fact\u201d as to the \u201cwant of merit in the asserted [per-\nsonal jurisdiction] defense,\u201d \u201c[t]he preservation of due process [is] se-\ncured\u201d (quoting Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, \n350\u201351 (1909))). While forfeiture of a personal jurisdiction defense \nmay be the product of mistake or inadvertence, rather than affirma-\ntive conduct evincing agreement, the Supreme Court has counted \nsuch forfeitures among the \u201clegal arrangements [that] have been \ntaken to represent . . . implied consent to . . . personal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 703. But beyond these forfeitures in the context of litigation, the \nexisting precedent suggests that the conduct necessary to support an \ninference of implied consent, whether related to the litigation or not, \nmust be some \u201cintentional[]\u201d act that can reasonably be construed as \na waiver of the personal jurisdiction requirement. Id. at 704. \n\n24a \n \nreturn for which the defendant is required to submit itself \nto suit in the forum. See Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2044 (plu-\nrality opinion) (explaining that personal jurisdiction may \nexist where the defendant has \u201caccept[ed] an in-state ben-\nefit with jurisdictional strings attached\u201d). The Supreme \nCourt\u2019s recent decision in Mallory highlighted such an ar-\nrangement: Mallory approved the exercise of consent-\nbased jurisdiction pursuant to a state business registra-\ntion statute that \u201crequire[d] an out-of-state firm to answer \nany suits against it in exchange for status as a registered \nforeign corporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d Id. at \n2033 (majority opinion). A plurality of the Justices noted \nthat this sort of \u201cexchange\u201d between the defendant and \nthe forum \u2014 in other words, \u201cconsent to suit in exchange \nfor access to a State\u2019s markets\u201d \u2014 \u201ccan signal consent to \njurisdiction\u201d in at least some cases. Id. at 2041 n.8 (plural-\nity opinion) (alterations adopted). \nThe litigation-related activities or reciprocal bargains \ndescribed above, just like \u201cexplicit consent,\u201d can supply a \nbasis \u201cfrom which it is proper to infer . . . an intention to \nsubmit\u201d to the forum, J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 880\u2013\n81 (plurality opinion), or are otherwise \u201cof such a nature \nas to justify the fiction\u201d of consent to a court\u2019s authority, \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318; see also Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 705 (explaining, with regard to litigation con-\nduct, that \u201cdue process [is] secured\u201d where the conduct \nsupports a \u201cpresumption of fact\u201d as to the existence of per-\nsonal jurisdiction). Under such circumstances, the asser-\ntion of consent-based personal jurisdiction does \u201cnot of-\nfend traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice,\u201d and is therefore consistent with constitutional due \nprocess. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702\u201303 (quoting \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316). \n\n25a \n \n2. \nThe appellants argue that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision subjects the PLO and the PA to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in a manner consistent with due process \nlimits. But the statute\u2019s terms are insufficient to establish \nthe defendants\u2019 valid consent, either express or implied, to \nwaive their constitutional right not to be sued in a court \nthat lacks personal jurisdiction over them. \nIt is undisputed that this case does not involve a de-\nfendant\u2019s express consent in any form \u2014 and for that rea-\nson, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a finding of consent \u201cfol-\nlows a fortiori from\u201d Carnival Cruise is misplaced. See \nPls.\u2019 Br. at 12\u2013 13, 28\u201329. In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that a specific forum-selection clause in a cruise ticket \nwas enforceable against the parties who had assented to \nthe agreement at issue. See Carnival Cruise, 499 U.S. at \n587\u201389. The decision in Carnival Cruise did not \u201cinfer[] \nconsent\u201d at all, see Pls.\u2019 Br. at 27\u201329, but instead enforced \nthe express jurisdiction-conferring language of a contract \nafter accounting for considerations of notice and funda-\nmental fairness.8 See Carnival Cruise, 499 U.S. at 593\u201395. \nThe appellants characterize the PSJVTA as establish-\ning implied consent, but the statute provides no basis for \na finding that the defendants have agreed to submit to the \njurisdiction of the United States courts. The PSJVTA does \nnot purport to determine that any litigation-related con-\nduct on the part of the PLO or the PA constitutes implied \nconsent to jurisdiction. Nor does the PSJVTA require sub-\nmission to the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction in exchange for, \n \n8 The plaintiffs also rely on Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311. But Szukhent \nconcerned the validity under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of \na contract provision that expressly appointed an agent for service of \nprocess. Id. at 315. As in Carnival Cruise, Szukhent enforced the ex-\npress terms of a contract. No express contract is at issue here. \n\n26a \n \nor as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit or \nprivilege. Instead, Congress selected certain non-litiga-\ntion activities in which the PLO and the PA had already \nengaged (or were alleged to have engaged) and decreed \nthat those activities, if continued or resumed after a cer-\ntain date, \u201cshall be deemed\u201d to constitute \u201cconsent[] to \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); see, e.g., \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1123\u201324, 1127, 1129\u201330 (describing \nallegations of PLO and PA activity in the United States); \nTaylor Force Act \u00a7 1002, 132 Stat. at 1143 (discussing the \nrelevant payments). The defendants\u2019 support for terror-\nism not targeted at the United States and their limited ac-\ntivities within the United States have already been found \nto be insufficient to establish general or specific jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and the PA in similar ATA cases, see, \ne.g., Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 339\u201342, and those same activ-\nities cannot reasonably be interpreted as signaling the de-\nfendants\u2019 \u201cintention to submit\u201d to the authority of the \nUnited States courts, see J. McIntyre Mach., 56 U.S. at \n881 (plurality opinion). Rather, such activities allegedly \nconstitute \u201cconsent\u201d under the PSJVTA only because \nCongress has labeled them that way. Thus, under the stat-\nute, the defendants incur a jurisdictional penalty for the \ncontinuation of conduct that they were known to partake \nin before the PSJVTA\u2019s enactment \u2014 conduct which, on \nits own, cannot support a fair and reasonable inference of \nthe defendants\u2019 voluntary agreement to proceed in a fed-\neral forum. This declaration of purported consent, predi-\ncated on conduct lacking any of the indicia of valid consent \npreviously recognized in the case law, fails to satisfy con-\nstitutional due process. \nPursuant to the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong, the PLO and \nthe PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d for \u201cmak[ing] any payment\u201d to the designees of \nincarcerated terrorists, or to the families of deceased \n\n27a \n \nterrorists, whose acts of terror \u201cinjured or killed a national \nof the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). This spe-\ncific non-litigation conduct cannot reasonably be under-\nstood as signaling the defendants\u2019 agreement to submit to \nthe United States courts. Accordingly, the effect of the \nfirst prong is to subject the defendants to a jurisdictional \nsanction \u2014 \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to the federal courts\u2019 au-\nthority \u2014 for continuing to make the payments at issue. \nIllustrating the point, the appellants themselves repeat-\nedly emphasize that the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong serves to \ndeter a congressionally disfavored activity. See, e.g., Pls.\u2019 \nBr. at 11 (the first prong \u201cincentivizes [the] [d]efendants \nto halt the universally condemned practice of making [the] \npayments\u201d at issue); Intervenor Br. at 25\u201326 (the first \nprong \u201cdiscourage[s]\u201d payments that Congress has linked \nto terrorist activity). But Congress has a variety of other \ntools at its disposal for discouraging the payments in ques-\ntion. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378c-1(a)(1)(B) (barring certain \nU.S. foreign aid that \u201cdirectly benefits\u201d the PA until both \nthe PLO and the PA have \u201cterminated\u201d the relevant pay-\nments). Imposing consent to personal jurisdiction as a con-\nsequence for those payments, and thereby divesting the \ndefendants of their Fifth Amendment liberty interest, is \nnot among them. \nThe second prong of the PSJVTA similarly specifies \npredicate conduct that does not evince the defendants\u2019 \nagreement to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States courts. This prong provides that the PLO \nand the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d for \u201cmaintain[ing] any office\u201d or \u201ccon-\nduct[ing] any activity while physically present in the \nUnited States,\u201d with a limited set of exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The appellants repeatedly suggest that \nthis prong is consistent with relevant precedents because \nit \u201c[c]ondition[s] permission\u201d for the defendants to engage \n\n28a \n \nin such activities, and to receive the attendant benefits of \ndoing so, \u201con their consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA \nactions.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 24; see Pls.\u2019 Br. at 48 (the de-\nfendants\u2019 \u201creceipt of [certain] benefits\u201d is \u201ccondition[ed] . \n. . on their consent\u201d). But this characterization is inaccu-\nrate, given that the statute does not provide the PLO or \nthe PA with any such benefit or permission. With the ex-\nception of UN-related conduct and offices, which are pro-\ntected pursuant to international treaty (and which, as set \nforth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3), are exempt from the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong), federal law has long prohibited \nthe defendants from engaging in any activities or main-\ntaining any offices in the United States, absent specific ex-\necutive or statutory waivers.9 See, e.g., Klinghoffer v. \n \n9 For example, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 imposes a \u201cwide \ngauged restriction of PLO activity within the United States [that], de-\npending on the nature of its enforcement, could effectively curtail any \nPLO activities in the United States, aside from the Mission to the \nUnited Nations.\u201d Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F.

Similar restrictions apply to the PA. See, e.g., Palestinian Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 2006 (\u201cPATA\u201d), Pub. L.

See Intervenor Br. at 24\u201325 (citing relevant waiver provi-\nsions); see also Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1129\u201331 (describing the \u201cformal \n. . . waiver procedure\u201d applicable to 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202). \n\n29a \n \nS.N.C.

The \nPSJVTA does not purport to relax or override these pro-\nhibitions, and the appellants have not identified any other \nchange in existing law (for example, a statutory or execu-\ntive waiver) that would otherwise authorize the restricted \nconduct. Thus, the statute\u2019s second prong cannot reasona-\nbly be construed as requiring a defendant\u2019s consent to ju-\nrisdiction in exchange for permission to engage in the \npredicate activities, because the defendants have not been \ngranted permission to engage in those activities at all.10 In-\nstead, the second prong exacts \u201cdeemed\u201d consent as a \nprice to be paid upon \u201cconduct[ing] [such] activit[ies],\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B), without conferring any rights or \nbenefits on the defendants in return. \nThe appellants argue that the PSJVTA is constitu-\ntionally sound because it gives the defendants \u201cfair \n \n10 The appellants do not dispute that the defendants are statutorily \nbarred from conducting activities in the United States. Rather, the \nplaintiffs suggest that the Government has historically permitted cer-\ntain activities as \u201ca matter of grace,\u201d thereby allowing the Govern-\nment to require consent in return. Pls.\u2019 Reply Br. at 25. But the Gov-\nernment retains the authority to enforce the relevant prohibitions and \ncould exercise it at any time. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5203 (authorizing the \nAttorney General to take any \u201cnecessary steps,\u201d including \u201clegal ac-\ntion,\u201d to enforce the restrictions as to the PLO); PATA \u00a7 7(b), 120 Stat. \nat 3324 (same as to the PA). Turning a blind eye to prohibited conduct \nthat remains subject to sanction or curtailment is not the same as au-\nthorizing such conduct. Cf. Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1131 (rejecting an \nattempt to \u201cequate [a] government \u2018failure to prosecute\u2019\u201d certain ac-\ntivities under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 with the \u201cwaiver or suspension\u201d of the \nrestrictions of those activities, for purposes of an analysis under the \nATCA). \n\n30a \n \nwarning\u201d of the relevant jurisdiction-triggering conduct \nand \u201creasonably advances legitimate government inter-\nests in the context of our federal system.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 11. \nThey derive this standard from a variety of cases describ-\ning basic principles of due process, including the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s decisions on specific jurisdiction in Ford Motor \nCo., 141 S. Ct. 1017, and Burger King, 471 U.S. 462. How-\never, the concepts of \u201cfair warning\u201d and \u201clegitimate gov-\nernment interests\u201d establish only minimum due process \nrequirements. These generalizations about due process do \nnot resolve the precise issue in this case, which is whether \nthe defendants have consented to suit in the absence of \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction. None of the cases on which \nthe appellants rely to support their broad due process test \npurported to answer that question.11  \nTellingly, the appellants have cited no case implying \nconsent to personal jurisdiction under circumstances sim-\nilar to those in this action. Instead, all of the appellants\u2019 \nauthorities concerning such implied consent involved a de-\nfendant\u2019s litigation-related conduct, or a defendant\u2019s ac-\nceptance of some in-forum benefit conditioned on amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts. Those cases premised \nconsent on activities from which it was reasonable to infer \n \n11 The plaintiffs also argue that the district court\u2019s analysis was \nflawed because it referred to the right at issue here, the due process \nright not to be haled into a forum lacking personal jurisdiction, as a \n\u201cfundamental constitutional right.\u201d See Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 580, \n591. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201ccertain fundamental \nrights\u201d trigger \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997), and accordingly, the plaintiffs suggest that the \ndistrict court must have applied an unduly strict standard in this case. \nThese arguments are without merit. The district court was plainly us-\ning the phrase \u201cfundamental\u201d in a colloquial sense, not as a formal \nclassification or a term of art, and we see no indication that the district \ncourt applied an inappropriately rigorous standard of scrutiny. \n\n31a \n \na defendant\u2019s submission to personal jurisdiction, but that \nis not the situation here. \nFor example, in Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a \ndecision that the appellants have relied on extensively, a \ndefendant appeared before the district court to assert a \npersonal jurisdiction defense, but then repeatedly failed to \ncomply with discovery orders \u201cdirected at establishing ju-\nrisdictional facts\u201d related to its contacts with the forum. \n456 U.S. at 695; see id. at 698\u201399. The district court accord-\ningly imposed a discovery sanction pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A), which provides that \ncertain facts may \u201cbe taken as established\u201d when a party \n\u201cfails to obey a[] [discovery] order\u201d concerning those facts. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A). Consistent with that Rule, the \ndistrict court treated the nonresident defendant\u2019s forum \ncontacts as having been proven, which in turn established \npersonal jurisdiction. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at \n695, 699. \nThe Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argu-\nment that this discovery sanction violated due process. Id. \nat 696. Relying on its previous decision in Hammond \nPacking Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322 (1909), the Su-\npreme Court explained that the \u201cpreservation of due pro-\ncess was secured by the presumption that the refusal to \nproduce evidence material to the administration of due \nprocess was but an admission of the want of merit in the \nasserted defense.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 \n(quoting Hammond Packing, 212 U.S. at 350\u201351). In other \nwords, the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to supply the requested in-\nformation as to its contacts with [the forum],\u201d after \u201c[h]av-\ning put the issue in question,\u201d could fairly be construed as \na tacit acknowledgment that the sought-after facts would \nestablish personal jurisdiction. Id. at 709. \n\n32a \n \nThe current case bears no resemblance to Insurance \nCorporation of Ireland. In contrast to the \u201cactions of the \ndefendant\u201d at issue there, id. at 704, the relevant conduct \nunder the PSJVTA takes place entirely outside of the liti-\ngation. Moreover, the Supreme Court made clear that the \napplication of the Hammond Packing presumption in In-\nsurance Corporation of Ireland, along with the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction that followed from it, was appropri-\nate only because the defendant\u2019s litigation conduct related \nto whether personal jurisdiction existed. To underscore \nthe point, the Supreme Court distinguished Hovey v. El-\nliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), which held that due process was \nviolated where a court rendered judgment against a de-\nfendant \u201cas \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure\u201d to pay a certain fee \n\u2014 conduct plainly unrelated to any \u201casserted defense\u201d in \nthat case. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705\u201306. The \neffect of the PSJVTA is similar: the statute subjects the \ndefendants to the authority of the federal courts for en-\ngaging in conduct with no connection to the establishment \nof personal jurisdiction, and indeed with no connection to \nlitigation in the United States at all. \nWith respect to non-litigation conduct, the appellants \nrely heavily on cases finding consent to jurisdiction based \non business registration statutes, which the plaintiffs de-\nscribed at oral argument as \u201cno different\u201d from the \nPSJVTA. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision \nin Mallory makes plain why those statutes are readily dis-\ntinguishable. Mallory arose out of a Virginia resident\u2019s \nlawsuit in Pennsylvania state court against his former em-\nployer, a Virginia railroad corporation, for damages sus-\ntained as a result of work in Virginia and Ohio. See 143 S. \nCt. at 2032\u201333. The plaintiff argued that the defendant had \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania when it \nregistered as a foreign corporation under Pennsylvania \nlaw, which \u201crequires out-of-state companies that register \n\n33a \n \nto do business in the [state] to agree to appear in its courts \non \u2018any cause of action\u2019 against them.\u201d Id. at 2033 (quoting \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i), (b) (2019)); see also id. at \n2037 (noting that the Pennsylvania statute \u201cexplicit[ly]\u201d \nprovides for general jurisdiction over registered foreign \ncorporations). The defendant did not dispute that it had \nregistered under the Pennsylvania statute, but it \u201cresisted \n[the plaintiff\u2019s] suit on constitutional grounds,\u201d raising the \nquestion of \u201cwhether the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment prohibits a State from requiring an \nout-of-state corporation to consent to personal jurisdiction \nto do business there.\u201d Id. at 2033. \nThe Supreme Court rejected this due process chal-\nlenge and held that the defendant was subject to jurisdic-\ntion in Pennsylvania based on the state\u2019s business regis-\ntration statute. See id. at 2032, 2037\u201338. The majority rea-\nsoned that the case fell \u201csquarely within [the] rule\u201d of \nPennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), see Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at \n2038, which, in the words of the plurality, established that \nthe type of business registration statute at issue \u201ccom-\nport[s] with the Due Process Clause,\u201d id. at 2033 (plurality \nopinion). Pennsylvania Fire specifically upheld the exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction pursuant to a Missouri state \nlaw \u201crequir[ing] any out-of-state insurance company de-\nsiring to transact any business in the State to . . . accept \nservice on [a particular state] official as valid in any suit.\u201d \nId. at 2036 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In that case, \u201cthere was \u2018no doubt\u2019 [the out-of-\nstate insurance company] could be sued in Missouri by an \nout-of-state plaintiff on an out-of-state contract,\u201d because \nthe corporation \u201chad agreed to accept service of process in \nMissouri on any suit as a condition of doing business \nthere.\u201d Id. (plurality opinion) (quoting Pennsylvania Fire, \n243 U.S. at 95). \n\n34a \n \nThat language \u2014 \u201cas a condition of doing business \nthere\u201d \u2014 explains why the statutes at issue in both Penn-\nsylvania Fire and Mallory could support a finding of im-\nplied consent to personal jurisdiction. Consent may be \nfairly inferred when a prospective defendant \u201cvoluntarily \ninvoke[s] certain [in-forum] benefits . . . conditioned on \nsubmitting to the [forum\u2019s] jurisdiction,\u201d because the ac-\nceptance of the benefit implicitly signals the defendant\u2019s \nagreement to appear in the forum\u2019s courts. Id. at 2045 \n(Jackson, J., concurring). Put differently, a defendant may \ngive its consent as part of a bargain: the defendant seeks \nand obtains a benefit that the forum has to offer, and the \ndefendant agrees to be sued in that jurisdiction in ex-\nchange. Thus, the statute at issue in Mallory supported a \nfinding of consent to jurisdiction because it \u201cgave the [de-\nfendant] the right to do business in-state in return for \nagreeing to answer any suit against it.\u201d 143 S. Ct. at 2041 \n(plurality opinion). Indeed, in discussing why such stat-\nutes count among the \u201clegal arrangements [that] may rep-\nresent . . . implied consent . . . consistent with due process,\u201d \nboth the majority and the plurality referred repeatedly to \nthis sort of \u201cexchange.\u201d12 Id. at 2044 n.10 (plurality \n \n12 See, e.g., Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2041 n.8 (plurality opinion) \n(\u201c[T]hese arrangements can include state laws requiring consent to \nsuit in exchange for access to a State\u2019s markets.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted and alterations adopted)); see also id. at 2033 (majority \nopinion) (\u201cPennsylvania law . . . requires an out-of-state firm to answer \nany suits against it in exchange for status as a registered foreign cor-\nporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d); id. at 2037 (majority opinion) \n(explaining that the registered defendant obtained \u201cboth the benefits \nand burdens shared by domestic corporations \u2014 including amenabil-\nity to suit in state court on any claim,\u201d and that the defendant \u201chas \nagreed to be found in Pennsylvania and answer any suit there\u201d); id. at \n2035 (plurality opinion) (describing a long history of state statutes \u201cre-\nquiring out-of-state corporations to consent to in-state suits in \n\n35a \n \nopinion) (internal quotation marks omitted and alterations \nadopted); see also id. at 2044 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A]ccept-\ning an in-state benefit with jurisdictional strings attached \n. . . can carry with [it] profound consequences for personal \njurisdiction.\u201d). The plurality also stressed the fundamental \nfairness of Mallory\u2019s outcome, given the scale of the de-\nfendant\u2019s operations in the state. See id. at 2041\u201343. Be-\ncause the defendant \u201chad taken full advantage of its op-\nportunity to do business\u201d in the forum, the plurality found \nno due process concern in enforcing its consent to jurisdic-\ntion against it. Id. at 2041. \nMallory therefore underscores the lack of merit in the \nappellants\u2019 asserted analogy between the PSJVTA and \nbusiness registration statutes. The PSJVTA does not re-\nquire that the PLO and the PA consent to jurisdiction as a \ncondition of securing a legal right to do business in the \nUnited States, which remains prohibited under current \nlaw, or to conduct any other presently unauthorized activ-\nity. Indeed, the statute does not offer any in-forum bene-\nfit, right, or privilege that the PLO and the PA could \u201cvol-\nuntarily invoke\u201d in exchange for their submission to the \nfederal courts. Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2045 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring). The defendants in this case cannot be said to \nhave accepted some in-forum benefit in return for an \nagreement to be amenable to suit in the United States.13  \n \nexchange for the rights to exploit the local market and to receive the \nfull range of benefits enjoyed by in-state corporations\u201d). \n13 The plaintiffs contend that we would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d if we en-\ndorsed the \u201cunprecedented\u201d proposition that an in-forum benefit is \nrequired to establish a defendant\u2019s consent to jurisdiction based on \nnon-litigation conduct. Pls.\u2019 July 26, 2023 Supp. Br. at 5, 6. But this \nargument misses the point. The receipt of a benefit from the forum is \nnot a necessary prerequisite to a finding that a defendant has con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction there. Rather, as in Mallory, this sort \nof \u201carrangement[]\u201d \u2014 that is, a defendant\u2019s voluntary acceptance of \n\n36a \n \nThe appellants\u2019 other examples of consent statutes \nare distinguishable on the same grounds. For example, the \nplaintiffs point to the state law at issue in Hess v. Paw-\nloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), which provided that a nonresi-\ndent motorist\u2019s use of the public roads \u201cshall be deemed \nequivalent\u201d to appointing an agent for service of process \nin actions \u201cgrowing out of any accident or collision in which \nsaid nonresident may be involved.\u201d Id. at 354 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Such a statute conditions \u201cthe \nuse of the highway,\u201d an in-state benefit from which states \nmay \u201cexclude\u201d nonresidents, on the nonresident\u2019s \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction. Id. at 356\u201357. Indeed, the \nstatute itself was phrased in those terms: it stated that \n\u201c[t]he acceptance by a nonresident of the rights and privi-\nleges\u201d associated with \u201coperating a motor vehicle . . . on a \npublic way in the [state]\u201d would be a \u201csignification of his \nagreement\u201d to service. Id. at 354 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The same logic applies to state statutes \nproviding that state courts, in certain classes of cases, can \nexercise consent-based jurisdiction over nonresident offic-\ners and directors of a business incorporated under that \nstate\u2019s laws. See Pls.\u2019 Br. at 29 (citing Hazout v. Tsang \nMun Ting, 134 A.3d 274, 289 (Del. 2016)). In \u201caccepting \nand holding\u201d the position of officer or director, Hazout, \n134 A.3d at 277, a \u201cprivilege\u201d that carries with it \n \nan in-forum benefit conditioned on amenability to suit \u2014 can suffice \nunder the circumstances to \u201csignal consent to jurisdiction.\u201d 143 S. Ct. \nat 2041 n.8 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). In \nother words, such an exchange can serve as a proxy for consent, from \nwhich it may be reasonable and fair to infer an agreement to submit \nto the forum. There are other means of demonstrating consent, such \nas certain litigation-related conduct. See, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. 703\u201305. But \u201cdeemed consent,\u201d absent some exchange of ben-\nefits, has never been recognized as a means of valid consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction \n\n37a \n \n\u201csignificant [state-law] benefits and protections,\u201d id. at \n292 n.66 (quoting Armstrong v. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174, \n176 (Del. 1980)), a nonresident can be said to have signaled \nan agreement to the jurisdictional consequences.14  \n \n14 Relying on other cases outside of the personal jurisdiction context, \nthe plaintiffs compare the PSJVTA to \u201cimplied consent laws that re-\nquire motorists . . . to consent to BAC [(blood alcohol content)] testing \nif they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of a drunk-\ndriving offense.\u201d Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013) (plu-\nrality opinion); see, e.g., South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 559 \n(1983) (describing one such statute as \u201cdeclar[ing] that any person op-\nerating a vehicle in [the state] is deemed to have consented to a chem-\nical test of the alcoholic content of his blood if arrested for driving \nwhile intoxicated\u201d). But these statutes, which implicate the Fourth \nAmendment\u2019s protections against unreasonable searches, see \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. at 148\u2013 51, are distinguishable for a variety of rea-\nsons, including those set forth above with regard to Mallory and Hess. \nLike the service-of-process statute considered in Hess, the \u201cimplied \nconsent laws\u201d for suspected drunk drivers require a motorist\u2019s con-\nsent to a particular obligation (specifically, \u201ccooperation with BAC \ntesting\u201d) as \u201ca condition of the privilege of driving on state roads.\u201d \nBirchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U.S. 438, 447\u201348 (2016); see McNeely, \n569 U.S. at 161 (plurality opinion) (noting that \u201call 50 states\u201d have \nadopted laws requiring drivers to consent to BAC testing \u201cas a condi-\ntion of operating a motor vehicle within the State\u201d). That is very dif-\nferent from the statute at issue here, which does not condition the de-\nfendants\u2019 consent on any in-forum privilege at all. \nFurther, the Supreme Court has never actually upheld these so-\ncalled implied consent laws under a consent theory. Rather, the Court \nhas assessed the constitutionality of these laws on a case-by-case ba-\nsis, relying on the exigency exception to the probable cause and war-\nrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment. See Mitchell v. Wiscon-\nsin, 139 S. Ct. 2525, 2532\u201333 (2019) (\u201cBut our decisions have not rested \non the idea that these laws . . . create actual consent to all the searches \nthey authorize.\u201d); see also id. at 2551 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (under-\nscoring that the Supreme Court did not address whether implied con-\nsent was sufficient to authorize the search). These cases, therefore, \nshed little light on when a constitutional right may be waived by im-\nplied consent. \n\n38a \n \nIn short, when a potential defendant accepts a govern-\nment benefit conditioned on submitting to suit in the fo-\nrum, such conduct may fairly be understood as consent to \njurisdiction there. The same is often true when a defend-\nant engages in litigation conduct related to the existence \nof personal jurisdiction. But in the PSJVTA, Congress has \nsimply declared that specific activities of the PLO and the \nPA \u2014 namely, certain payments made outside of the \nUnited States, and certain operations within the United \nStates (which remain unlawful) \u2014 constitute \u201cconsent\u201d to \njurisdiction. No aspect of these allegedly jurisdiction-trig-\ngering activities can reasonably be interpreted as evincing \nthe defendants\u2019 \u201cintention to submit\u201d to the United States \ncourts. J. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion). \nCongress cannot, by legislative fiat, simply \u201cdeem\u201d activi-\nties to be \u201cconsent\u201d when the activities themselves cannot \nplausibly be construed as such. Cf. McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917) (noting that, in \u201cexten[ding] . . . the \nmeans of acquiring [personal] jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cgreat caution \nshould be used not to let fiction deny the fair play that can \nbe secured only by a pretty close adhesion to fact\u201d). \nLike the district court, we need not decide whether, \n\u201cunder different circumstances, Congress or a state legis-\nlature could constitutionally \u2018deem\u2019 certain conduct to be \nconsent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at \n587. But for such a statute to pass muster, \u201cthe predicate \nconduct would have to be a much closer proxy for actual \nconsent than the predicate conduct at issue\u201d here. Id. Be-\ncause the PSJVTA\u2019s predicate activities cannot reasona-\nbly be understood as signifying the defendants\u2019 consent, \nthe statute does not effect a valid waiver of the defendants\u2019 \ndue process protection against the \u201ccoercive power\u201d of a \nforeign forum\u2019s courts. Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918; see \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 328, 329. \n\n39a \n \nB. \nOur conclusion also follows from College Savings \nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Ex-\npense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). That decision concerned \na federal statute, the Trademark Remedy Clarification \nAct (\u201cTRCA\u201d), which provided that states would forgo \ntheir Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal Lan-\nham Act litigation if they committed \u201cany violation\u201d of the \nLanham Act\u2019s prohibitions on false and misleading adver-\ntising. Id. at 670 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1122(b)). As relevant \nhere, the petitioner argued that a state could be said to \nhave \u201c\u2018impliedly\u2019 or \u2018constructively\u2019 waived its immunity\u201d \nupon engaging in the relevant predicate conduct \u2014 \nnamely, \u201cthe activities regulated by the Lanham Act\u201d \u2014 \nafter \u201cbeing put on notice by the clear language of the \nTRCA that it would be subject to [suit] for doing so.\u201d Id. \nat 669, 676, 680. \nThe Supreme Court rejected that proposition. It con-\ncluded that even with \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d advance notice \nfrom Congress, a state\u2019s \u201cvoluntarily elect[ing] to engage \nin the federally regulated conduct\u201d at issue would not suf-\nfice to render the state suable. Id. at 679\u201381. Such conduct, \nthe Supreme Court explained, supplied no basis \u201cto as-\nsume actual consent\u201d to suit in federal court. Id. at 680. To \nhold otherwise would ignore the \u201cfundamental difference \nbetween a State\u2019s expressing unequivocally that it waives \nits immunity\u201d (in which case, one can \u201cbe certain that the \nState in fact consents to suit\u201d) and \u201cCongress\u2019s expressing \nunequivocally its intention that if the State takes certain \naction it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d \nId. at 680\u201381. The decision explained: \nIn the latter situation, the most that can be said with \ncertainty is that the State has been put on notice that \nCongress intends to subject it to suits brought by \n\n40a \n \nindividuals. That is very far from concluding that the \nState made an altogether voluntary decision to waive \nits immunity. \nId. at 681 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). The Supreme Court also saw no merit in the no-\ntion that a state could be \u201cdeemed to have constructively \nwaived its sovereign immunity\u201d simply because \u201cthe as-\nserted basis for [the] waiver [was] conduct that the State \nrealistically could choose to abandon.\u201d Id. at 679, 684. This \nfact, the decision noted, \u201cha[d] no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. at 684. \nThis reasoning underscores the unconstitutionality of \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision. The statute \npurports to extract consent to personal jurisdiction using \nthe very same template that College Savings Bank con-\ndemned in the sovereign immunity context: it identifies ac-\ntivities that, in Congress\u2019s judgment, the PLO and the PA \n\u201crealistically could choose to abandon,\u201d and it \u201cexpress[es] \nunequivocally [Congress\u2019s] intention that if [either defend-\nant] takes [those] action[s] it shall be deemed to have\u201d con-\nsented to a federal court\u2019s authority. Id. at 681, 684. The \nappellants repeatedly contend that this statutory frame-\nwork gives rise to constructive consent because the predi-\ncate conduct is itself \u201cvoluntary,\u201d and the defendants \n\u201cknowing[ly]\u201d continued such conduct with \u201cnotice\u201d of the \nstatute\u2019s terms. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 19\u201320; see Intervenor Br. at 2\u2013\n3. But College Savings Bank rejected that precise theory \nof constructive consent, making clear that the ability to \n\u201cabandon\u201d the relevant predicate conduct \u201cha[s] no bear-\ning upon the voluntariness of the [asserted] waiver.\u201d 527 \nU.S. at 684. Instead, as College Savings Bank explained \nwith regard to the state respondent, \u201cthe most that can be \nsaid\u201d about the defendants here \u201cis that [each] has been \nput on notice that Congress intends to subject it to \n\n41a \n \n[certain] suits\u201d in federal court. Id. at 681. That is a \u201cvery \nfar\u201d cry from an \u201caltogether voluntary decision\u201d on the \npart of either defendant to submit to a court\u2019s jurisdiction. \nSee id. \nThe appellants argue that the logic of College Savings \nBank is inapplicable here because the decision concerned \nthe \u201cspecial context\u201d of state sovereign immunity, where \nthe standard for waiver is \u201cparticularly strict.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at \n30\u201331 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Coll. Sav. \nBank, 527 U.S. at 675 (describing the \u201ctest for determin-\ning whether a State has waived its immunity\u201d as a \u201cstrin-\ngent one\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the rel-\nevant aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning were not \nso cabined. To the contrary, the decision emphasized that \n\u201cconstructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associ-\nated with the surrender of constitutional rights,\u201d and it \nnoted that constructive waivers like the one considered \nthere \u2014 a close match for the sort of \u201cdeemed consent\u201d at \nissue here \u2014 \u201care simply unheard of in the context of . . . \nconstitutionally protected privileges.\u201d 527 U.S. at 681 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted). \nThe Supreme Court illustrated this point with an analogy \nto an entirely different constitutional context: \n  [I]magine if Congress amended the securities laws \nto provide with unmistakable clarity that anyone com-\nmitting fraud in connection with the buying or selling \nof securities in interstate commerce would not be en-\ntitled to a jury in any federal criminal prosecution of \nsuch fraud. Would persons engaging in securities \nfraud after the adoption of such an amendment be \ndeemed to have \u201cconstructively waived\u201d their consti-\ntutionally protected rights to trial by jury in criminal \ncases? After all, the trading of securities is not so vital \nan activity that any one person's decision to trade \n\n42a \n \ncannot be regarded as a voluntary choice. The answer, \nof course, is no. The classic description of an effective \nwaiver of a constitutional right is the intentional relin-\nquishment or abandonment of a known right or privi-\nlege. \nId. at 681\u201382 (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted, alterations adopted). \nThis example was pertinent, the Supreme Court ex-\nplained, because the Eleventh Amendment privilege of \n\u201c[s]tate sovereign immunity, no less than the [Sixth \nAmendment] right to trial by jury in criminal cases, is con-\nstitutionally protected.\u201d Id. at 682. The same is true with \nregard to the \u201cdue process right not to be subjected to \njudgment in [a foreign forum\u2019s] courts,\u201d J. McIntyre \nMach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion), which, like the \nSixth Amendment jury trial right, is a \u201clegal right protect-\ning the individual,\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704. \nThe plaintiffs nevertheless suggest that we should ignore \nthe lessons of College Savings Bank because its general \nstatements regarding waivers of constitutional rights are \nnonbinding \u201cdicta.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 13, 30, 32. But \u201cit does not \nat all follow that we can cavalierly disregard\u201d those state-\nments. United States v. Bell, 524 F.2d 202, 206 (2d Cir. \n1975). Even if Supreme Court dicta do not constitute es-\ntablished law, we nonetheless accord deference to such \ndicta where, as here, no change has occurred in the legal \nlandscape. United States v. Harris, 838 F.3d 98, 107 (2d \nCir. 2016) (citing Newdow v. Peterson, 753 F.3d 105, 108 \nn.3 (2d Cir. 2014)); Bell, 524 F.2d at 206 (noting that Su-\npreme Court dicta \u201cmust be given considerable weight\u201d). \nThat deference is especially warranted in this case, given \nthe close parallels between the PSJVTA and the statutory \nframework that College Savings Bank rejected. \n\n43a \n \nIndeed, the voluminous briefing in this case makes \nclear that the PSJVTA\u2019s approach to deemed consent is \n\u201csimply unheard of,\u201d Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681, be-\ncause those papers, while extensive, fail to identify a single \ncase approving a similar constructive waiver of the per-\nsonal jurisdiction requirement. The briefs instead rely en-\ntirely on personal jurisdiction cases that are inapposite or \ndistinguishable, for all of the reasons discussed above. \nThe appellants also cite various cases involving waiv-\ners of other constitutional rights, but those cases do not \nsupport the constitutionality of the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d im-\nposed in the PSJVTA. For example, in arguing that waiv-\ning a constitutional right does not require any exchange of \nbenefits, the appellants point to United States v. O\u2019Brien, \n926 F.3d 57 (2d Cir. 2019). In O\u2019Brien, however, the de-\nfendant had expressly consented to the warrantless \nsearches of his properties, in writing, rendering that case \na plainly inapt comparison on the question of constructive \nconsent.15 Id. at 77. The appellants\u2019 authorities concerning \nvalid waivers of the Fifth Amendment privilege against \nself-incrimination are similarly far afield. See Moran v. \nBurbine, 475 U.S. 412 (1986); Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. \n298 (1985). The criminal suspects\u2019 actions in those cases, \ntaken upon receiving clear and comprehensive warnings \npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), left \n\u201cno doubt\u201d (in Moran) or \u201cno question\u201d (in Elstad) that \neach had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Fifth \nAmendment protections. See Moran, 475 U.S. at 417\u201318, \n421\u201322 \n(respondent \nexecuted \n\u201cwritten \nform[s] \n \n15 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 \nU.S. 218 (1973), a case that the plaintiffs cited at oral argument, is \nlikewise distinguishable because it focused on an instance of express \nconsent \u2014 in particular, to the warrantless search of a vehicle. See id. \nat 220. \n\n44a \n \nacknowledging that he understood his [Miranda] \nright[s],\u201d and then gave a free and uncoerced confession); \nElstad, 470 U.S. at 314\u201315, 315 n.4 (respondent gave af-\nfirmative verbal responses confirming that he understood \nhis Miranda rights, then provided a free and uncoerced \ndescription of his offense). \nThe PSJVTA also finds no support in the plaintiffs\u2019 \ncases concerning implied waivers of a litigant\u2019s right to \nproceed before an Article III court. See Wellness Int\u2019l Net-\nwork, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665 (2015); Roell v. Withrow, \n538 U.S. 580 (2003). In these decisions, the Supreme Court \nexplained that such waivers could be fairly inferred based \non specific litigation conduct, namely, \u201cvoluntarily ap-\npear[ing] to try [a] case before [a] non-Article III adjudi-\ncator\u201d after \u201c[being] made aware of the need for consent \nand the right to refuse it.\u201d Wellness Int\u2019l Network, 575 \nU.S. at 685 (internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing \nimplied consent to a bankruptcy judge\u2019s resolution of cer-\ntain claims); Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 n.3, 591 (discussing im-\nplied consent to a magistrate judge\u2019s disposition of an ac-\ntion). Those authorities are unlike this case, where the de-\nfendants have not engaged in any conduct (litigation-re-\nlated or otherwise) evincing an \u201cintention of . . . submitting \nto the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 n.3 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nIn sum, Congress cannot take conduct otherwise in-\nsufficient to support an inference of consent, brand it as \n\u201cconsent,\u201d and then decree that a defendant, after some \ntime has passed, is \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to the loss \nof a due process right for engaging in that conduct. This \nunprecedented framework for consent- based jurisdiction, \npredicated on conduct that is not \u201cof such a nature as to \njustify the fiction\u201d of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \n\n45a \n \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 318 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Thus, the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion is incompatible with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause. \nC. \nThe appellants and their amici make various other ar-\nguments in support of the constitutionality of the PSJVTA \nand the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case, none \nof which is persuasive. \nThe Government defends the constitutionality of the \nPSJVTA on the grounds that the predicate conduct at is-\nsue is \u201cclosely linked to the only claim for which personal \njurisdiction is permitted, a civil ATA action concerning at-\ntacks on Americans.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 30. But the rele-\nvant question here is not whether the predicate conduct \nidentified in the statute bears some relation to the activi-\nties proscribed under the ATA, or to Congress\u2019s interest \nin remediating the harms that flow from those activities. \nRather, the question is whether such conduct demon-\nstrates the defendants\u2019 valid consent to the authority of a \nUnited States court. No basis exists to conclude that it \ndoes. \nAlso unpersuasive is the Government\u2019s contention \nthat Congress, in furtherance of an important legislative \npurpose, narrowly tailored the PSJVTA to establish juris-\ndiction over only the PLO, the PA, and their \u201csuccessors \nor affiliates.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 24. Such singling out does \nnot cure a constitutional deficiency. Where, as here, a stat-\nute impinges on constitutional rights, it cannot be salvaged \non the basis that it violates the rights of only a handful of \nsubjects. \nRelatedly, the Government contends that this Court \nmust defer to Congress\u2019s choices in crafting the PSJVTA \nbecause the statute is \u201ccentrally concerned with matters \n\n46a \n \nof foreign affairs,\u201d a realm in which the political branches \nenjoy \u201cbroad authority.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 27. Invalidating \nthe statute, the Government argues, would frustrate leg-\nislative and executive efforts to give full effect to the \nATA\u2019s civil liability provisions, which comprise part of the \nnation\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive legal response to international \nterrorism.\u201d Id. at 22\u201323 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). It is true, of course, that when \u201csensitive interests in \nnational security and foreign affairs [are] at stake,\u201d the \npolicy judgments of both Congress and the Executive are \n\u201centitled to significant weight.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian \nLaw Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36 (2010). But it is equally true \nthat the Government\u2019s broad \u201cforeign affairs power . . . , \n\u2018like every other governmental power, must be exercised \nin subordination to the applicable provisions of the Consti-\ntution.\u2019\u201d Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 416 \nn.9 (2003) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. \nCorp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). Indeed, \u201c[o]ur deference \nin matters of policy cannot . . . become abdication in mat-\nters of law,\u201d and \u201c[o]ur respect for Congress\u2019s policy judg-\nments . . . can never extend so far as to disavow restraints \non federal power that the Constitution carefully con-\nstructed.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 538 (2012). \nThus, a statute \u201ccannot create personal jurisdiction \nwhere the Constitution forbids it.\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks \non Sept. 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by \nSamantar v.

Socialist Peo-\nple\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 95 (D.C. Cir. \n2002). Because the PSJVTA purports to provide consent-\nbased jurisdiction in a manner at odds with constitutional \ndue process, the statute cannot stand, notwithstanding the \n\n47a \n \npolicy concerns that motivated its enactment. See Nat\u2019l \nFed\u2019n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 538 (\u201c[T]here can be no \nquestion that it is the responsibility of th[e] Court to en-\nforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of \nCongress that transgress those limits.\u201d). \nThe appellants also urge us to depart from our prior \nholding that the due process analyses under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments parallel one another in civil \ncases, see Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330, and to embrace in-\nstead the view that the Fifth Amendment imposes com-\nparatively looser requirements for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction. For its part, the Government argues that \nCongress, as compared to state legislatures subject to the \nFourteenth Amendment, should be permitted under the \nFifth Amendment to authorize \u201ca greater scope of per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d where it wishes to facilitate federal ad-\njudication of certain \u201clegal claims.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 39\u2013\n40. As the basis for this position, the Government contends \nthat the Supreme Court \u201chas tied the limitations of its \nFourteenth Amendment personal jurisdiction jurispru-\ndence\u201d to interstate federalism concerns, which do not \nsimilarly constrain the exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative \npower. Id. at 37\u201338. Under the Government\u2019s theory, the \nFifth Amendment subjects Congress to a more lenient due \nprocess standard, allowing it to enact the sort of \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision featured in the PSJVTA \u2014 \u201c[e]ven if,\u201d \ndue to their limited sovereignty, \u201cstate[s] could not enact \nsimilar legislation consistent with the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.\u201d Id. at 40. \nThe short answer to this argument is that the panel\u2019s \nopinion in Waldman I is the law of the Circuit and cannot \nbe changed unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court or \nby this Court in an en banc or \u201cmini-en banc\u201d decision. See \nUnited States v. Peguero, 34 F.4th 143, 158 & n.9 (2d Cir. \n\n48a \n \n2022). In any event, federalism is not the only constraint \non the exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Douglass v. \nNippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 (5th \nCir. 2022) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Douglass v. \nKaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023) (mem.); Livnat, 851 F.3d at \n55 (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is not just about federalism.\u201d). \nFundamentally, the Constitution\u2019s personal jurisdiction \nrequirements represent a \u201crestrict[ion] [on] judicial \npower\u201d \u2014 and, as a corollary, a restriction on the legisla-\ntive ability to expand that power \u2014 \u201cnot as a matter of \nsovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u201d J. \nMcIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion) (quot-\ning Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702). Thus, to the ex-\ntent that the need for personal jurisdiction operates as a \nlimit on a state\u2019s sovereign authority, that effect \u201cmust be \nseen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty in-\nterest preserved by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Ins. Corp. \nof Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702 n.10. Relatedly, the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s precedents make clear that one of the \u201cvital pur-\npose[s] of personal-jurisdiction standards,\u201d whether ap-\nplied in state or federal court, \u201cis to ensure fairness to the \ndefendant.\u201d Livnat, 851 F.3d at 55 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted and alteration adopted). \nFor these very reasons, several courts of appeals, in-\ncluding ours, have rejected the notion that federalism\u2019s ir-\nrelevance in the Fifth Amendment context justifies a \n\u201cmore lenient\u201d standard for personal jurisdiction. Wald-\nman I, 835 F.3d at 329\u201330; see, e.g., Livnat, 851 F.3d at \n54\u201355; see also Douglass, 46 F.4th at 236\u201338 (\u201cBecause the \nDue Process Clauses use the same language and guaran-\ntee individual liberty in the same way, it makes sense that \nthe standards developed in the Fourteenth Amendment \ncontext must govern under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). No \nbasis exists to conclude that the same argument, rooted in \nthe absence of federalism-related restrictions on national \n\n49a \n \npower, would warrant relaxing due process constraints on \nCongress\u2019s ability to \u201cdeem[] certain actions . . . to be con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 40. \nWhether premised on contacts or consent, subjecting a \nnonresident defendant to the power of a particular forum \nimplicates compelling concerns for fairness and individual \nliberty, and those \u201cstrong justifications for personal-juris-\ndiction limits apply equally in Fifth Amendment cases.\u201d \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55.16  \nThe plaintiffs take a somewhat different approach to \nthis Fifth Amendment issue: they ask us to invoke our \n\u201c\u2018mini en banc\u2019 process,\u201d overrule Waldman I entirely, \nand embrace the broader Fifth Amendment standard used \nfor personal jurisdiction in criminal cases, so that the dis-\ntrict court may assert \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d over the de-\nfendants irrespective of whether the PSJVTA gives rise to \nvalid consent. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 16, 49. Together with their amici, \nthe plaintiffs raise a host of historical, structural, and prac-\ntical considerations, including many of the same federal-\nism-related arguments already rejected above, in an at-\ntempt to secure a more permissive interpretation of the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process limits. \nThese arguments, however, provide no persuasive ba-\nsis for disturbing a binding decision of this Court, espe-\ncially where that decision accords with existing Circuit \ncase law and the overwhelming weight of authority from \n \n16 Moreover, \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be \u2018simple,\u2019 \u2018easily ascer-\ntainable,\u2019 and \u2018predictable.\u2019\u201d Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56 (alterations \nadopted) (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137). The Government\u2019s pro-\nposal meets none of those criteria. While the Government assures us \nthat not every conceivable \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision would pass \nmuster under a relaxed Fifth Amendment standard, it fails to identify \nany workable limitation on the \u201cgreater scope\u201d of jurisdiction that \nwould be permitted.

In contending that \nseveral federal courts of appeals have held otherwise, see Pls.\u2019 Br. at \n59\u201360, the plaintiffs rely on outdated authorities, chief among them a \nvacated decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, see Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 996 F.3d \n289 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), opinion vacated and reh\u2019g en banc \ngranted, 2 F.4th 525 (5th Cir. 2021) (mem.), which subsequently con-\ncluded that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments require the same personal jurisdiction analysis, see 46 \nF.4th 226 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc). The plaintiffs also misstate the \nholdings of other cases, which nowhere suggested that the personal \njurisdiction requirements of the Fifth Amendment are less stringent \nthan those applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., \nPinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 370\u201371 & 370 n.2 (3d Cir. \n2002) (invoking Fourteenth Amendment due process \u201cminimum con-\ntacts\u201d standards where the Fifth Amendment applied); see also Peay \nv. BellSouth Med. Assistance Plan, 205 F.3d 1206, 1211\u201312 (10th Cir. \n2000) (similarly borrowing Fourteenth Amendment standards to con-\nduct a Fifth Amendment inquiry). \n\n51a \n \nSixth, Seventh, Eleventh, Federal, and D.C. Circuits); see \nalso Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54\u201355 & 55 n.5 (similar). Moreo-\nver, Waldman I was not the first decision of this Court to \napply Fourteenth Amendment due process principles in a \nFifth Amendment context; the analysis there followed \nfrom prior Circuit precedents that \u201cclearly establish[ed] \nthe congruence of [the] due process analysis under both \nthe Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments.\u201d 835 F.3d at 330 \n(citing, among other authorities, Chew, 143 F.3d at 28 n.4, \nand In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, \n673\u201374 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also Porina v. Marward Ship-\nping Co., 521 F.3d 122, 127\u201329 (2d Cir. 2008). Therefore, \nwe decline the invitation to abandon our prior ruling and \nupend settled law on the due process standards under the \nFifth Amendment. \nTo the extent the plaintiffs ask us to revisit any other \naspect of our decision in Waldman I, we decline that invi-\ntation as well. After explaining that the Fifth and Four-\nteenth Amendment due process analyses parallel one an-\nother in civil actions, Waldman I faithfully applied the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s binding due process precedents, including \nits then-recent decision in Daimler, to conclude that the \nPLO and the PA could not be subjected to general or \n \nThe Supreme Court has never \u201cexpressly analyzed whether the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendment standards differ,\u201d instead reserv-\ning decision on the issue. Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54; see, e.g., Bristol-Mey-\ners, 582 U.S. at 268\u201369 (\u201c[S]ince our decision concerns the due process \nlimits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, we leave open \nthe question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.\u201d). \nOther courts of appeals have observed that on at least one occasion, \nthe Supreme Court appears to have \u201cinstinctively relied on its Four-\nteenth Amendment personal jurisdiction jurisprudence\u201d in the Fifth \nAmendment context. Douglass, 46 F.4th at 239 (citing Republic of Ar-\ngentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 620 (1992), in turn quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 475); accord Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54. \n\n52a \n \nspecific jurisdiction under the circumstances presented. \nIn three separate cases involving similar ATA claims, the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. See Shatsky, 955 \nF.3d at 1036\u201337; Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1123\u201326; Livnat, \n851 F.3d at 56\u201357. No aspect of the present dispute affects \nour decision in Waldman I as to what constitutional due \nprocess requires. \n* \n* \n* \nWe reiterate the district court\u2019s closing observation \nthat just \u201c[a]s in Waldman I, the killing of Ari Fuld was \n\u2018unquestionably horrific\u2019 and [the] [p]laintiffs\u2019 efforts to \nseek justice on his and their own behalf are morally com-\npelling.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 595 (quoting Waldman \nI, 835 F.3d at 344). But \u201cthe federal courts cannot exercise \njurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits\u201d of the Due \nProcess Clause, \u201cno matter how horrendous the underly-\ning attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d \nId. at 595\u201396 (quoting Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 344). The \nPSJVTA provides for personal jurisdiction over the PLO \nand the PA in a manner that exceeds those constitutional \nlimits. Because the statute violates due process, the de-\nfendants cannot be \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in this case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the parties \nand their amici. To the extent not specifically addressed \nabove, those arguments are either moot or without merit. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision regarding \u201cdeemed\u201d consent to personal juris-\ndiction is inconsistent with constitutional due process. Ac-\ncordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against the PLO and \nthe PA was properly dismissed for lack of personal juris-\ndiction, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). The judgment of the \ndistrict court is AFFIRMED. \n\n \n(53a) \nAPPENDIX B \n15-3135-cv (L) \nWaldman v.

This Court concluded on appeal that the \ndistrict court lacked both general and specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and the PA, and we therefore vacated the \njudgment entered against the defendants and remanded \nthe action for dismissal. The plaintiffs later moved to recall \nthe mandate in this case based on a new statute, the Anti-\nTerrorism Clarification Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183. We denied that motion because the stat-\nute\u2019s prerequisites had not been met. \nCongress responded with the statute now at issue, the \nPromoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 \nStat. 2534, 3082. The PSJVTA provides that the PLO and \nthe PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d in any civil ATA action if, after a specified \ntime, those entities either (1) make payments, directly \nor indirectly, to the designees or families of incarcerated \nor deceased terrorists, respectively, whose acts of terror \ninjured or killed a United States national, or (2) under-\ntake any activities within the United States, subject to lim-\nited exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).

The district court \n(Daniels, J.) concluded that the defendants had engaged in \njurisdiction-triggering conduct under the statute, but that \nthe PSJVTA violated constitutional due process require-\nments. Both the plaintiffs and the Government now dis-\npute the latter conclusion, and the plaintiffs argue gener-\nally that the PSJVTA justifies recalling the mandate. \nIn Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization, __ \nF.4th __, No. 22-76 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2023), which we also \ndecide today, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is inconsistent \nwith the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Thus, no \nbasis exists to recall the mandate in this case, and the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate is DENIED. \n \nKENT A.

See id. \u00a7 2333(a). On appeal from a sub-\nstantial post-trial judgment entered against the defend-\nants, this Court concluded that the district court lacked \nboth general and specific personal jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA. See Waldman v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 835 F.3d 317, 344 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018) (mem.). We accordingly vacated \nthe judgment and remanded the action for dismissal of \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Id. Our mandate issued on Novem-\nber 28, 2016. \nSince that time, Congress has twice enacted statutes \npurporting to establish personal jurisdiction over the PLO \nand the PA on the basis of consent, which, when validly \ngiven, may constitute an independent basis for subjecting \na defendant to suit in a forum lacking general and specific \njurisdiction. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 \nU.S. 462, 472 & n.14 (1985); Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n703\u201304 (1982); see also Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 143 \nS. Ct. 2028, 2039 (2023) (plurality opinion). After the \npassage of the first such statute, the Anti-Terrorism \nClarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183, the plaintiffs moved to recall the mandate \nin this case. In June 2019, we denied that motion because \nthe ATCA\u2019s prerequisites for personal jurisdiction had \n\n60a \n \nnot been satisfied. See Waldman v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 925 F.3d 570, 574\u201376 (2d Cir. 2019) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d) \n(per curiam), cert. granted, judgment vacated sub nom. \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020) (mem.). \nCongress responded with the enactment of the statute \nnow at issue, the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. \n116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082. The PSJVTA pro-\nvides that the PLO and the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any civil ATA action, \nirrespective of \u201cthe date of the occurrence\u201d of the underly-\ning \u201cact of international terrorism,\u201d upon engaging in cer-\ntain forms of post-enactment conduct, namely (1) making \npayments, directly or indirectly, to the designees or fami-\nlies of incarcerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, \nwhose acts of terror injured or killed a United States na-\ntional, or (2) undertaking any activities within the United \nStates, subject to a handful of exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nThe Supreme Court vacated and remanded our de-\ncision in Waldman II in light of the PSJVTA\u2019s enact-\nment, see Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. 2714, and we in turn re-\nmanded to the district court for the limited purpose of \nconsidering the new statute\u2019s effect on this case. The \ndistrict court (Daniels, J.) concluded that the defendants \nhad engaged in jurisdiction-triggering conduct under the \nstatute, but that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion violated constitutional due process requirements. The \nplaintiffs dispute the latter conclusion, and they argue gen-\nerally that the PSJVTA justifies recalling this Court\u2019s \nmandate. The Government, as intervenor pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n\n61a \n \n5.1(c), joins the plaintiffs in defending the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutionality. \nWe address the very same constitutional issue \nin Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization,    F.4th   \n, No. 22-76 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2023), which we also decide \ntoday. In Fuld, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision \nfor \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is incon-\nsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment. Thus, the statute cannot be applied to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO or the PA, and as a result, \nno basis exists to recall the mandate in this case. \nI. BACKGROUND \nWe assume familiarity with Waldman I, Waldman \nII, and our decision today in Fuld, which collectively \ndetail the history of this litigation and the relevant \nstatutory background. \nThe plaintiffs commenced this action against the PLO \nand the PA in 2004, invoking the ATA\u2019s civil damages rem-\nedy for \u201cnational[s] of the United States injured . . . by rea-\nson of an act of international terrorism.\u201d1 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a). Throughout the pretrial proceedings, the PLO \nand the PA repeatedly moved to dismiss the claims against \nthem for lack of personal jurisdiction. All of those motions \nwere denied. The district court determined that it could \nexercise general jurisdiction over the defendants, see \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 04-cv-397, 2011 \nWL 1345086, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2011), even after the \nSupreme Court narrowed the applicable test for \n \n1 As explained in Fuld, the PA was established under the 1993 Oslo \nAccords to serve as the non-sovereign and interim governing body of \nparts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d). The PLO, an entity founded in 1964, conducts \nPalestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Permanent Observer to the \nUnited Nations on behalf of the Palestinian people. \n\n62a \n \ngeneral jurisdiction in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014).2 See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. \n04-cv-397, 2014 WL 6811395, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2014). \nAfter a seven-week trial beginning in January \n2015, a jury found the defendants liable for six of the \nterror attacks at issue and awarded damages of $218.5 \nmillion, an amount automatically trebled to $655.5 million \npursuant to the ATA. See Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 322, 324; \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). During the trial and again in post-trial \nbriefing, the defendants unsuccessfully reasserted their \nargument that the case should be dismissed for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. The district court rejected those argu-\nments and entered final judgment. The defendants then \nmade the same arguments on appeal to this Court.  \nIn Waldman I, this Court agreed with the de-\nfendants. The decision explained that the PLO and the \nPA have a Fifth Amendment due process right not to be \nsued in a forum with which they have insufficient contacts, \nsee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 329, and that the personal ju-\nrisdiction analysis is \u201cbasically the same under both the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d id. at 330. Applying \nDaimler, we determined that the district court lacked gen-\neral jurisdiction because the PLO and the PA are not \u201cat \nhome\u201d in the United States, but \u201cin Palestine, where these \nentities are headquartered and from where they are di-\nrected.\u201d Id. at 334 (emphasis omitted) (citing Daimler, 571 \nU.S. at 139 n.20). We also found that the district court could \nnot subject the defendants to specific jurisdiction, given \nthe absence of any \u201csubstantial connection\u201d between their \n\u201csuit-related conduct \u2014 their role in the six terror attacks \nat issue \u2014 [and] . . . the forum.\u201d Id. at 335 (citing Walden v. \n \n2 For procedural reasons not relevant here, the proceedings before \nthe district court are captioned differently, as Sokolow v. Palestine \nLiberation Organization, No. 04-cv-397 (S.D.N.Y.). \n\n63a \n \nFiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014)). Thus, \u201c[t]he district \ncourt could not constitutionally exercise either general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d Id. at \n344. We vacated the judgment of the district court and re-\nmanded the action \u201cwith instructions to dismiss the case \nfor want of personal jurisdiction.\u201d3 Id. at 322. \nOur mandate issued on November 28, 2016. See Judg-\nment Mandate, No. 15-3135, Doc. No. 248 (2d Cir. Nov. 28, \n2016). The plaintiffs then filed a petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari, which was denied in April 2018. See Sokolow, 138 \nS. Ct. at 1438. \nCongress responded to Waldman I and similar deci-\nsions with the enactment of the ATCA, Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183, a precursor to the statute at issue here. The \nATCA amended the ATA to include a new subsection, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), which provided that a defendant \nwould \u201cbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in . . . [a civil ATA] action if,\u201d following a 120-day pe-\nriod after the ATCA\u2019s enactment, the defendant (1) \u201cac-\ncept[ed]\u201d certain \u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from the United \nStates, or (2) \u201cmaintain[ed]\u201d an office \u201cwithin the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States\u201d pursuant to a waiver or suspen-\nsion of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, a provision barring the PLO from \n \n3 As discussed in Fuld, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit similarly concluded that federal courts \nlacked both general and specific jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA \nin civil ATA cases related to terrorist activity abroad. See Livnat v. \nPalestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 54\u201358 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (concluding \nthat exercising general or specific jurisdiction over the PA would not \n\u201cmeet the requirements of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause\u201d), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 373 (2018) (mem.); see also Shatsky v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 955 F.3d 1016, 1036\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(same as to both the PLO and the PA); Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian \nAuth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1123\u201326 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (same), judgment va-\ncated on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 2713 (2020) (mem.), opinion rein-\nstated in part, 820 F. App\u2019x 11 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (mem.). \n\n64a \n \noperating any such office. ATCA \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. at 3184. The \nATCA took effect on October 3, 2018. \nSeveral days later, on October 8, 2018, the plaintiffs \nfiled a motion to recall the November 2016 mandate issued \nin this action. The plaintiffs argued that the ATCA estab-\nlished personal jurisdiction over the defendants with re-\ngard to the previously dismissed claims. We rejected \nthat contention in Waldman II, reasoning that \u201c[t]he \nplaintiffs ha[d] not shown that either factual predicate . . . \nof the ATCA [was] satisfied.\u201d 925 F.3d at 574. Specifically, \nthe plaintiffs did not dispute that the PLO and the PA \nwere no longer \u201caccept[ing] qualifying assistance\u201d from \nthe United States, and they had failed to show that the de-\nfendants were maintaining any offices \u201cwithin the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States\u201d while \u201cbenefit[ing] from a \nwaiver or suspension\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202. Id. at 574\u201375. \nFor these reasons, and in light of \u201c[t]his Court\u2019s interest in \nfinality,\u201d we concluded that the circumstances did not \n\u201cwarrant invoking the extraordinary remedy of recalling \na mandate issued two and a half years\u201d earlier. \nId. at 575\u201376. Accordingly, on June 3, 2019, the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate was denied. Id. at 576. \nWhile the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari \nfrom Waldman II was pending, Congress acted again, \nthis time enacting the PSJVTA on December 20, 2019. See \nPub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082. A de-\ntailed description of the PSJVTA is set forth in Fuld. \nBriefly, \u00a7 903(c) of the PSJVTA superseded the ATCA \nprovision codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), resulting in a nar-\nrowed definition of the term \u201cdefendant,\u201d which now re-\nfers solely to the PLO, the PA, and any \u201csuccessor[s]\u201d or \n\u201caffiliate[s]\u201d thereof.4 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). The PSJVTA \n \n4 As stated in Fuld, the PSJVTA also includes a number of additional \nprovisions, but we do not pass on the constitutionality of any portion \n\n65a \n \nalso specified new post-enactment conduct that would be \n\u201cdeemed\u201d to constitute \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA actions, \u201cregardless of the date of the occur-\nrence of the act of international terrorism upon which such \ncivil action was filed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nThese new factual predicates for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d are \nlisted in two prongs, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). The first prong provides that \u201ca de-\nfendant shall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d if, after April 18, 2020, the defendant \u201cmakes \nany payment, directly or indirectly\u201d: \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, after \nbeing fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been impris-\noned for committing any act of terrorism that injured \nor killed a national of the United States, if such pay-\nment is made by reason of such imprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, following \nsuch individual\u2019s death while committing an act of ter-\nrorism that injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of the death \nof such individual. \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). Under the second prong, \u201ca defendant \nshall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d \nif, after January 4, 2020, the defendant \u201ccontinues to main-\ntain,\u201d \u201cestablishes,\u201d or \u201cprocures any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in the \nUnited States,\u201d or otherwise \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of the \n[PLO] or the [PA].\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The PSJVTA ex-\nempts \u201ccertain activities and locations\u201d from the reach of \n \nof the PSJVTA other than \u00a7 903(c). For purposes of clarity, this opin-\nion refers to \u00a7 903(c) as the PSJVTA, which is consistent with the opin-\nion in Fuld, as well as with the nomenclature used in the district court\u2019s \ndecisions and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal. \n\n66a \n \nthis second prong, including, among others, conduct re-\nlated to \u201cofficial business of the United Nations.\u201d5 Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nSeveral months after the PSJVTA\u2019s enactment, the \nSupreme Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, vacated the judgment in Waldman II, and re-\nmanded the case \u201cfor further consideration in light of \nthe [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714. On Septem-\nber 8, 2020, this Court in turn issued an order pursuant \nto United States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir. \n1994), remanding the action to the district court \u201cfor the \nlimited purposes of determining the applicability of the \nPSJVTA to this case, and, if the PSJVTA is determined to \napply, any issues regarding its application to this case in-\ncluding its constitutionality,\u201d Order, No. 15-3135, Doc. No. \n368 (Sept. 8, 2020). We stated that \u201c[a]fter the district \ncourt has concluded its consideration, the case will be re-\nturned to this Court for further proceedings,\u201d and that in \nthe meantime, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the Novem-\nber 2016 mandate would be \u201cheld in abeyance.\u201d Id. \nAfter this limited remand to the district court, the Gov-\nernment intervened in the action to defend the constitu-\ntionality of the PSJVTA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a); Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 5.1(c). Several months later, on March 10, 2022, the \ndistrict court issued a decision related to the questions \n \n5 In particular, and as discussed in Fuld, the PSJVTA includes excep-\ntions for facilities and activities devoted \u201cexclusively [to] the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(A)\u2013(B), specified activities related to engagements with \nUnited States officials or legal representation, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(C)\u2013(E), \nand any activities \u201cancillary to [those] listed\u201d in these exceptions, id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(F). Congress also provided that the PSJVTA \u201cshall apply \nto any case pending on or after August 30, 2016,\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7 903(d)(2), \n133 Stat. at 3085, just one day before this Court\u2019s decision in Waldman \nI. \n\n67a \n \npresented in our Jacobson remand order. See Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 590 F. Supp. 3d 589 \n(S.D.N.Y.), reconsideration denied, 607 F. Supp. 3d 323 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2022). The district court found that the de-\nfendants had triggered the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), because the \u201c[p]laintiffs ha[d] pre-\nsented sufficient evidence to support the determination \nthat [the] [d]efendants . . . made [qualifying] payments af-\nter April 18, 2020.\u201d6 Id. at 594. Nonetheless, the district \ncourt determined that \u201c[t]he conduct identified in the [first \nprong] is insufficient to support a finding that [the] \n[d]efendants have consented to personal jurisdiction,\u201d \nid. at 596, and accordingly, the statute \u201cviolate[s] [con-\nstitutional] due process,\u201d id. at 597. \nOn March 24, 2022, we reinstated the proceedings con-\ncerning the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate. The \nplaintiffs then moved for reconsideration of the district \ncourt\u2019s March 10, 2022 decision, specifically requesting \nthat the district court make factual findings under the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong and consider its constitutionality. \nWe stayed the proceedings in this Court pending the res-\nolution of that motion. \nThe district court denied the motion for reconsidera-\ntion on June 15, 2022. See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 607 F. Supp. 3d 323, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). It declined \nto resolve the parties\u2019 factual dispute as to whether the \n \n6 Specifically, the district court found that the defendants had made \npayments \u201cto the families of individuals killed while committing acts \nof terrorism . . . [that] harmed U.S. nationals,\u201d thereby triggering 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)(ii). Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d at 594. The dis-\ntrict court did not address whether the defendants had made payments \nto the designees of incarcerated terrorists, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(1)(A)(i), and it also declined to \u201creach the issue of whether the \nfactual predicates in . . . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B),\u201d the PSJVTA\u2019s sec-\nond prong, \u201cha[d] been met.\u201d Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d at 595 n.3. \n\n68a \n \ndefendants\u2019 United States activities were exempt from the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong, because \u201c[e]ven accepting [the] \n[p]laintiffs\u2019 argument\u201d that no exception applied, the \n\u201ctypes of conduct\u201d at issue did not evince \u201cany intention on \nthe part of [the] [d]efendants to legally submit to suit in \nthe United States.\u201d7 Id. at 326. In light of that determina-\ntion and its March 10, 2022 decision, the district court con-\ncluded that \u201cthe exercise of [personal] jurisdiction under \neither of the PSJVTA\u2019s two jurisdiction-triggering prongs \nwould violate due process.\u201d Id. at 327\u201328. \nWith the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration re-\nsolved, we lifted the stay on these proceedings concerning \nthe motion to recall the mandate. \nII. DISCUSSION \nOur principal task is to give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to \nthe motion at issue in Waldman II \u2014 that is, the plaintiffs\u2019 \nOctober 2018 motion to recall this Court\u2019s November 2016 \nmandate \u2014 \u201cin light of the [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. \nat 2714. \n\u201cWe possess an inherent power to recall a mandate, \nsubject to review for \nabuse of discretion.\u201d Taylor v. \nUnited States, 822 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted and alteration adopted). However, \n \n7 To support their argument that the defendants had engaged in non-\nexempt activities \u201cwhile physically present in the United States,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B)(iii), the plaintiffs pointed to the defendants\u2019 \n\u201cprovision of consular services in the United States, their interviews \nwith prominent media and social media activity, and their maintenance \nof an office in New York.\u201d Sokolow, 607 F. Supp. 3d at 325. The de-\nfendants did \u201cnot dispute\u201d that they had engaged in these activities; \ninstead, the defendants argued that all of the conduct in question fell \nwithin the PSJVTA\u2019s exemptions for UN-related conduct. Id. at 325\u2013\n26; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(A), (F). The district court found that it \nwas unnecessary to resolve this issue, and we need not resolve it on \nappeal. \n\n69a \n \n\u201c[i]n recognition of the need to preserve finality in judicial \nproceedings, . . . we exercise [this] authority sparingly and \nonly in exceptional circumstances.\u201d Id. (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted and alteration adopted); see also Cal-\nderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 550 (1998). In some \ncases, the enactment of a new statute might justify the ex-\nercise of our power to recall a previously issued mandate. \nCf. Sargent v. Columbia Forest Prods., Inc., 75 F.3d 86, \n90 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that a recall may be warranted \nwhere changes in governing law cast serious doubt on a \nprevious judgment). But given today\u2019s decision in Fuld, \nthis case is not one of them. \nThe plaintiffs make a variety of arguments in support \nof their position that \u201c[t]his Court should recall the man-\ndate, apply the PSJVTA in this case, and remand to the \ndistrict court with instructions to reinstate its original \njudgment based on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 2. All of \nthose arguments, however, flow from the premise that the \nPSJVTA \u201cestablishes [consent-based] personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d over the PLO and the PA in a manner consistent with \ndue process. Id. at 26. We reach the opposite conclusion \ntoday in Fuld, and we incorporate the entirety of Fuld\u2019s \nanalysis here. Thus, as set forth in Fuld, the PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction vi-\nolates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nBecause we find in Fuld that the PSJVTA is uncon-\nstitutional, the statute cannot be applied to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO or the PA in this case. Ac-\ncordingly, no basis exists to recall the November 2016 man-\ndate that issued after Waldman I, where we determined \nthat the plaintiffs\u2019 claims had to be \u201cdismiss[ed] . . . for \nwant of personal jurisdiction.\u201d 835 F.3d at 322. In view of \nthis conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the parties\u2019 \n\n70a \n \nvarious disputes that assume the constitutionality of the \nPSJVTA. \nWe reiterate that the terror attacks at issue in this lit-\nigation were \u201cunquestionably horrific.\u201d Id. at 344. But as \nwe stated in Waldman I and reaffirm today in Fuld, \u201cthe \nfederal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case be-\nyond the limits\u201d of the Due Process Clause, \u201cno matter how \nhorrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id. The PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction exceeds those \nconstitutional limits, and accordingly, the statute supplies \nno basis for taking the extraordinary step of recalling this \nCourt\u2019s mandate. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the parties \nand their amici. To the extent not specifically addressed \nabove, those arguments are either moot or without merit. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall \nthe November 2016 mandate is DENIED. \n \n\n \n(71a) \nAPPENDIX C \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n \nMARK I.

The statute is \ntherefore determined to be unconstitutional. Plaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion for reconsideration, (ECF No. 1056), is denied. \nBACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiffs brought this action against Defendants in \n2004, asserting causes of action for international \n \n1 The relevant factual and procedural background is set forth \nin greater detail in this Court\u2019s original determination on the \napplicability and constitutionality of the PSNTA, see Sokolow v. \n\n72a \n \n \nterrorism pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), \ncodified at 18 U.S.C. 2333, and various state law claims. \n(ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved repeatedly to dismiss \nthe complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. (ECF \nNos. 45, 66, 93.) This Court denied their motions, \nreasoning that \u2018the totality of activities in the United \nStates by the PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of gen-\neral personal jurisdiction.\u201d Sokolow v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30 2011), vacated sub nom. Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org. 835 F.3d 317,337 (2d Cir. \n2016). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daim-\nler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the Second Circuit \nvacated this Court\u2019s decision and held that exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction over Defendants violated the Due Pro-\ncess Clause of the Fifth Amendment because neither de-\nfendant was \u201cat home\u201d in the United States, and the ter-\nrorist attacks at issue \u201cwere not sufficiently connected \nto the United States\u201d to support specific personal juris-\ndiction. Waldman, 835 F.3d at 333-34, 337. \nIn response to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWaldman Congress passed a series of statutes ex-\npanding the bases on which a defendant can be deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction,  including, \nas relevant here, the PSJVTA.  Specifically, the \nPSJVTA states that a defendant is deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction by (1) making pay-\nments to the designees of individuals imprisoned or \nkilled as a result of committing any act of terrorism that \ninjured or killed a U.S. citizen (the PS JVTA\u2019s \u201cpay-\nments prong\u201d ), and (2) maintaining any premises in \n \nPalestine Liberation Org., No. 04 CIV. 397 (GBD), 2022 WL \n719261 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2022), and is incorporated by refer-\nence herein. \n\n73a \n \n \nthe United States or conducting any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestinian Authority or the Palestinian Libera-\ntion Organization (the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cU.S. activities \nprong\u201d ). 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2334(e)(l). Following the pas-\nsage of the PSJVTA, the Second Circuit remanded \nthis case to this Court \u201c for the limited purpose of \ndetermining the applicability of the PSJVTA to this \ncase, and if the PSJVTA is determined to apply, any \nissues regarding its application to this case including \nits constitutionality.\u201d (ECF No. 1006, at 3.) On March \n10, 2022, this Court issued a Memorandum Decision \nand Order in which it held that the factual predicate for \napplication of the PSJVTA\u2019s payments prong to this \ncase had been established, and that the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction pursuant to that prong would be un-\nconstitutional. Sokolow, 2022 WL 719261 at *2-6. \nShortly after entry of this Court\u2019s order, Plaintiffs \nmoved for reconsideration, requesting that this Court \nundertake a similar analysis with respect to the \nPSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities prong. (ECF No. 1056.) This \ndecision follows. \nTHE PSJVTA DOES NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY \nPROVIDE FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER \nDEFENDANTS \nPlaintiffs point to three categories of conduct they \ncontend meet the PSJVTA\u2019s test for consent to jurisdic-\ntion based on non-exempt (non-United Nations \n(\u201cU.N.\u201d)) activities in the United States. (ECF No. \n1057, at 20.) Specifically, Plaintiffs rely on Defendants\u2019 \nprovision of consular services in the United States, their \ninterviews with prominent media and social media activ-\nity, and their maintenance of an office in New York. (Id. \nat 20-23, 32.) Defendants do not dispute they have en-\ngaged in these types of activities. Rather Defendants \n\n74a \n \n \nargue that their conduct falls within the PSJVTA\u2019s ex-\nclusions for official U.N. or U.N.-ancillary activities un-\nder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). (ECF No. 1064, at 15-26.) \nDefendants also argue that the factual predicates of \nthe U.S. activities prong of the PSJVTA even if met \nare not sufficient to support an exercise of personal \njurisdiction consistent with the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment. (Id. at 6-12.) This Court agrees \nwith Defendants\u2019 latter argument, and in doing so, joins \ntwo other courts in concluding that an exercise of juris-\ndiction under either of the PSJVTA\u2019s factual predicates \nis unconstitutional. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., No. 20-CV-3374 (JMF) 2022 WL 62088 at *7 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6 2022); Shatsky v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 18-CV-12355 (MKV) 2022 WL 826409, \nat*5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18 2022).2 \nEven accepting Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defend-\nants\u2019 United States activities fall within the ambit of \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities prong-a finding this \nCourt need not make in order to resolve the instant \nmotion-these types of conduct do not infer any inten-\ntion on the part of Defendants to legally submit to \nsuit in the United States.3 As the Court explained in \nFuld, in promulgating the PSJVTA, Congress \n\u2018simply took conduct in which the PLO and PA had \npreviously engaged\u2014conduct that the Second and \n \n2 Plaintiffs\u2019  claim that \u201c[n]o court has addressed\u201d the U.S. ac-\ntivities prong of the PSJVTA, (ECF No. 1057, at 13), is incor-\nrect. Both the Fuld and Shatsky Courts specifically considered \nthe U.S. activities prong and ultimately held it unconstitutional. \n3 Both this Court in its March 10, 2022 decision and the Fuld \nCourt discuss the history of the jurisprudence on jurisdiction by \nconsent. Sokolow 2022 WL 719261, at *2-6; Fuld, 2022 WL 62088 \nat *6. This Court will not belabor the discussion by repeating that \nhistory here. \n\n75a \n \n \nD.C. Circuits had held was insufficient to support per-\nsonal jurisdiction in Waldman I and Shatsky I\u2014and de-\nclared that such conduct shall be deemed to be consent.\u201d \nFuld, 2022 WL 62088, at *7. But Congress \u201ccannot \nsimply declare anything it wants to be consent.\u201d Id. at \n*12. Consent is not \u201ca legal fiction devoid of content\u201d and \nneither the courts nor Congress may \u201cengag[e] in circular \nreasoning that premises consent on the presumption that \ndefendants know the law and then define[] the law so \nthat anyone engaging in the defined conduct is deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction.\u201d M3 USA \nCorp. v. Qamoum, No. CV 20-2903 (RDM), 2021 \nWL 2324753, at *12 (D.D.C. June 7, 2021). Consti-\ntutional due process \u201crequires more than notice and the \nopportunity to conform ones conduct for effective con-\nsent to jurisdiction.\u201d Shatsky, 2022 WL 826409 at *5. \nThe activities at issue here\u2014primarily the notarization \nof documents and a handful of interactions with the me-\ndia\u2014are insufficient to support any meaningful consent \nto jurisdiction by Defendants.4 \nThe alternate personal jurisdiction theories Plain-\ntiffs advance do not support their constitutional \n \n4 Plaintiffs rely on Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, \n641 (2d Cir. 2016), for their claim that \u201cthe Second Circuit has \nacknowledged the continued vitality of cases holding that \u2018a defend-\nant may consent to personal jurisdiction without regard to what a \ndue process analysis of its contacts would yield.\u2019\u201d (ECF No. 1057, \nat 15 (quoting Brown).) Brown acknowledged no such theory. To \nthe contrary, the Brown Court only noted that other Circuits have \nso held, and then went on to reject that interpretation: \u201cBut as the \nSupreme Court recognized ... the reach of that coercive power, \neven when exercised pursuant to a corporation\u2019s purported \u2018 con-\nsent,\u2019 may be limited by the Due Process clause.\u201d Brown, 814 F.3d \nat 641. \n\n76a \n \n \nargument.5 As Defendants correctly note Burnham\u2019s \ntag jurisdiction theory only applies to individuals.6 See \ne.g., Estate of Ungar v. Palestinian Auth. \n400 \nF.Supp.2d 541 553 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), aff\u2019d, 332 P. App\u2019x \n643 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing Burnham, 495 U.S. 604); Mar-\ntinez v. Aero Caribbean, 764 F.3d 1062, 1064 (9th Cir. \n2014). Plaintiffs\u2019 secondary suggestion, that Defendants \nconsented to jurisdiction solely by virtue of the fact that \nCongress permits their presence in the United States, re-\nlies heavily on pre-International Shoe case law from the \nnineteenth century that is now obsolete, and in any event, \nrequired some transaction of business in the forum that \nis absent here. See e.g., Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. \nv. Harris, 79 U.S. 65, 81 (1870) (\u201cif it does business there, \nit will be presumed to have assented\u201d); Hess v. Pawloski,  \n274 U.S. 352 355 (1927) (\u201ctransaction of business in state\u201d \nsupports \u201cconsent to be bound by the process of its \ncourts\u201d); Washington v. Superior Ct. of Wash. 289 U.S. \n \n5 This Court notes that Plaintiffs could have raised these theories \nwhich rely on personal jurisdiction case law long predating the in-\nitiation of this suit, in their responses to any of Defendants\u2019 several \nmotions  to dismiss. Motions for reconsideration are not to reiter-\nate previous arguments or raise new arguments that could have \nbeen raised earlier. See e.g., Wil!iams v. Romarm, 751 F. App\u2019x 20, \n24 (2d Cir. 2018). This Court further notes that several of these \ntheories have already been foreclosed by the Second Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in Waldman. Waldman, 835 F.3d at 337. \n6 \u201cTag jurisdiction\u201d refers to a court\u2019s exercise of personal juris-\ndiction over an individual who is served and thus \u201ctagged\u201d while \nphysically present in the forum. In re Edelman, 295 F.3d 171,  179 \n(2d Cir. 2002) (citing Burnham v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 495 U.S. 604 \n(1990) (plurality opinion)); see also Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, \n247 (2d Cir. 1995) (\u201cFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2) specifically authorizes \npersonal service of a summons and complaint upon an individual \nphysically present within a judicial district of the United States, and \nsuch personal service comports with the requirements of due process \nfor the assertion of personal jurisdiction.\u201d ). \n\n77a \n \n \n361, 364-65 (1933) (state \u201cneed not have admitted the cor-\nporation to do business within its borders\u201d). Finally,  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defendants have consented to \njurisdiction in the United States because they \u201creceive \nsubstantial benefits\u201d from their U.S. activities is mis-\nplaced, because a defendant\u2019s receipt of benefits is rele-\nvant to the issue of specific jurisdiction,  not jurisdiction \nby consent. C.f. Fuld, 2022 WL 62088, at *12, n. 10 (\u201crec-\niprocity\u201d or receipt of benefits is not a component of the \nconsent analysis) (collecting cases); see also, Hess, 274 \nU.S. at 356 (\u201cthe implied consent is limited to proceed-\nings growing out of accidents or collisions on a highway \nin which the nonresident may be involved.\u201d). Even if De-\nfendants reap benefits from their activities in the \nUnited States, jurisdiction is still lacking because, as \nthe Second Circuit has already held, the conduct about \nwhich Plaintiffs complain in this suit did not involve \n(and, in fact long predates) the PSJVTA\u2019s in-territory \nactivities in which Defendants now engage. Waldman, \n835 F.3d at 344 (jurisdiction does not exist in this case \nbecause the terror attacks at issue were not expressly \naimed at the United States, death and injuries suffered \nby U.S. nationals were random, and lobbying activities \nregarding American policy toward Israel are insuffi-\nciently suit-related). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above and in this Court\u2019s \nMarch 10, 2022 decision, Sokolow, 2022 WL 719261, at \n*2-6,  the exercise of jurisdiction under either of the \nPSJVTA\u2019s two jurisdiction\u00adtriggering prongs would vi-\nolate due process. The statute is therefore unconstitu-\ntional. \n\n78a \n \n \nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to close the open \nmotions at ECF Nos. 1056 and 1068.7 \nDated:  June 15, 2022 \n \nNew York, New York \nSO ORDERED. \n George B.

DANIELS, United States District Judge: \nThis action returns to this Court on remand from the \nSecond Circuit for the \u201climited purposes of determining \nthe applicability of the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. \nJ, tit. IX,\u00a7 903, 133 State. 3082 (the \u201cPSJVTA\u201d)\u201d and \u201cany \nissues regarding its application to this case including its \nconstitutionality.\u201d (Mandate of the U.S.C.A., ECF No. \n1006, at 3.) \nFollowing remand, the parties, submitted briefing con-\ncerning: (1) whether the factual predicates for application \nof the PSJVTA have been met; and (2) whether application \nof the statute is unconstitutional. On May 19, 2021, this \nCourt heard argument from the parties. After oral argu-\nment, the parties filed supplementing briefing. (Defend-\nants\u2019 Letter dated June 9, 2021, ECF No. 1031; Plaintiffs \nLetter dated July 6, 2021, ECF No. 1035.) On September \n7, 2021, the Government intervened in this action and filed \n\n80a \n \n \na memorandum of law in support of the constitutionality \nof the PSNTA. (Government\u2019s Brief in Support of \nPSJVTA, ECF No. 1043). Defendant responded to the \nGovernment\u2019s brief. (Defendants\u2019 Letter dated Septem-\nber 20, 2021, ECF No. 146.) Having considered the par-\nties\u2019 arguments, the Court finds (I) that the factual predi-\ncate for application of the PSJVTA to this case has been \nestablished, and (2) that the statute is unconstitutional. \nI.  BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiffs brought this action against Defendants in \n2004, asserting causes of action for international terrorism \npursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), codified in \n18 U.S.C. 2333, and various state law claims. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal juris-\ndiction in July 2007. (Notice of Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, \nECF No. 45.) In a memorandum decision and order dated \nSeptember 30, 2008, Defendants\u2019 motion was denied with-\nout prejudice; Plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion for jurisdictional \ndiscovery was granted. (ECF No. 58.) Defendants re-\nnewed their motion to dismiss the Complaint on May 29, \n2009. (Notice of Renewed Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, \nECF No. 66.) In a memorandum decision and order dated \nMarch 11, 2010, this Court denied Defendants\u2019 motion \nwithout prejudice to renew at the close of jurisdictional \ndiscovery. (ECF No. 79.) Following the close of jurisdic-\ntional discovery in April 2010, Defendants renewed their \nmotion. (Notice of Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, ECF No. \n81.) In a memorandum decision and order dated March \n30, 2011, Defendants\u2019 motion was denied. (ECF No. 87.) \nDefendant next moved to transfer venue to the District of \nColumbia or, in the alternative, to dismiss the case for lack \nof personal jurisdiction. (Notice of Mot. to Transfer \n \n1 The Court references only the underlying facts and procedural his-\ntory necessary to explain the Court\u2019s decision. \n\n81a \n \n \nVenue, ECF No. 93.) That motion was denied in an Order \ndated June 2, 2011. (ECF No. 122.) \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daimler \nAG v. Bauman, Defendants moved for reconsideration of \nthis Court\u2019s March 2011 Memorandum Decision and Or-\nder. (Notice of Mot. for Reconsideration, ECF No. 421.) \nDefendants\u2019 motion was denied in an Order dated June \n16, 2014. (ECF No. 537.) Defendants moved for summary \njudgment, arguing that Daimler required dismissal for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. (Notice of Mot. for Summary \nJudgment, ECF 496.) Defendants\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment was denied. (Memorandum Decision and Order \ndated December 1, 2014, ECF No. 657.) Defendants peti-\ntioned the Second Circuit for expedited review of the deci-\nsion and for a stay of all district court proceedings pending \nreview, including of the trial scheduled for January l, \n2015. (Notice of Motion for Stay of Proceedings, ECF \nNo. 665.) Defendants\u2019 petition and motion were denied. \n(Mandate dated January 28, 2015, ECF No., 777.) Follow-\ning a seven-week trial, a jury returned a verdict for Plain-\ntiffs. (Judgment, ECF No. 980.) Defendants appealed the \nverdict. On appeal, the Second Circuit found that Defend-\nants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the fo-\nrum to allow the Court to exercise general or specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction over them. Waldman v. Palestine Liber-\nation Org., 835 F.3d 317,323 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded \nthe case with instructions to dismiss the action for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction \u201cover defendants with respect to the \nclaims in this action.\u201d (Id at 4.) \nIn reaction to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Wald-\nman, Congress passed the Anti\u2022 Terrorism Clarification \nAct (\u201cATCA\u201d). Pub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018). \nThe ATCA amended the ATA, providing that a defendant \n\n82a \n \n \nis deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in a \ncivil action under the ATA (1) by accepting US foreign as-\nsistance, or (2) by benefitting from a waiver or suspension \nof 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205.2 After the passage of the law, Plaintiffs \npetitioned the Second Circuit to recall its mandate in light \nof the ATCA The Second Circuit denied the petition, find-\ning that the factual predicates of the ATCA had not been \nsatisfied because, at the time of the appeal, Defendants \nwere not accepting U.S. foreign assistance, they were not \nbenefitting from a waiver or suspension of Section 1003 of \nthe ATA, nor were Defendants maintaining an office or fa-\ncility within the jurisdiction of the United States. Wald-\nman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 925 F.3d 570, 573 (2d \nCir. 2019) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d). Plaintiffs appealed Waldman \nII to the Supreme Court. While the appeal was pending, \nCongress passed the PSJVTA, expanding the bases on \nwhich a defendant can consent to personal jurisdiction. \nSpecifically, the statute states that a defendant may con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction in cases under the ATA by (1) \nmaking payments to the designees of individuals impris-\noned or killed as a result of committing any act of terror-\nism that injured or killed a U.S. citizen, and (2) maintaining \nany premises in the United States or conducting any activ-\nity while physically present in the United States on behalf \nof the Palestinian Authority or the Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2334(e)(l). Following the pas-\nsage of the PSJVTA, the Supreme Court vacated and re-\nmanded the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Waldman II for \nfurther consideration in light of the PSJVTA. Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714, 206 L. Ed. 2d \n852 (2020). \n \n2 Section 5202 forbids the PLO and its successors and agents from \nexpending funds or maintaining facilities within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States. \n\n83a \n \n \nII.  THE PSJVTA APPLIES TO THE CASE \nThe PSJVTA creates personal jurisdiction over de-\nfendants on the basis of deemed consent where a defendant \nmakes payments that trigger the application of the statute, \nor where a defendant engages in certain activities in the \nUnited States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nPlaintiffs argue that the PSJVTA is applicable to this \ncase under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) because \nDefendants have made payments after April 18, 2020 to \nindividuals convicted for, or killed while, committing acts of \nterrorism that harmed U.S. nationals. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo-\nrandum of Law (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Brief\u2019), ECF No. 1018, at 8.) \nPlaintiffs also argue that the statute applies under 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(B)(i) and (ii) because Defendants maintained \nan office in New York City, provided counselor services, \nheld press conferences, and updated social media ac-\ncounts for \u201cthe State of Palestine\u201d after January 4, \n2020. (Id. at 17-18.) \nIn their opposition, Defendants argue that the office \nin New York City is not \u201cin\u201d the United States for the \npurpose of the statute because it is part of the Palestin-\nian Liberation Organization\u2019s (\u201cPLO\u201d) Mission to the \nUnited Nations (\u201cU.N.\u201d) headquartered in New York. \n(Defendants Memorandum of Law (\u201cDefendants\u2019 Oppo-\nsition\u201d), ECF No. 1021, at 11.) In support, Defendants \npoint to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(B). (Id) Defendants also \nargue that their U.S. activities may not be considered \nfor the purpose of determining applicability of the \nPSJVTA because their activities have been undertaken \nexclusively for the purpose of conducting official busi-\nness of the U.N. or, alternatively, fall under exemptions \nto the application of the statute in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3) \nbecause their activities are part of official UN business. \n(Id at 13.) With regards to the payment prong of the \n\n84a \n \n \nstatute, Defendants do not contest that they made pay-\nments triggering application of the PSJVTA under 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(A). (Defendants\u2019 Opposition at 2.) Instead, \nDefendants argue that terrorism convictions that were \nobtained in Israeli military trials were not \u201cfairly tried,\u201d \nas required for application of the statute based on 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(A)(i). (Id.) \nThe PSJVTA is codified at 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l). The \nstatute states that \u201cfor the purposes of any civil action \nunder Section 2333 of this title, a defendant shall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nsuch civil action if, regardless of the date of the occur-\nrence of the act of international terrorism upon which \nsuch civil action was filled,\u201d defendant engages in cer-\ntain conduct. Id. The statute has two factual predicates \nwhich, if established, triggers applicability. Under the \nfirst factual predicate, the statute will apply where a de-\nfendant, \n[A]fter the date that is 120 days after the date of \nenactment of the [PSJVTA], makes any payment \ndirectly or indirectly -- (i) to any payee desig-\nnated by any individual who, after being fairly \ntried or pleading guilty, has been imprisoned \nfor committing any act of terrorism that injured \nor killed a national of the United States, if such pay-\nment is made by reason of such imprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, follow-\ning such individual\u2019s death while committing an act \nof terrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason of \nthe death of such individual [.] \n18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A). The second factual predicate \nstates that the statute will apply where a defendant, \n\n85a \n \n \n[A]fter 15 days after the date of enactment of the \n[PSJVTA] -- (i) continues to maintain any office, \nheadquarters, premises, or other facilities or estab-\nlishments in the United States; (ii) establishes or \nprocures any office, headquarters, premises, or \nother facilities or establishments in the United \nStates; or (iii) conducts any activity while physically \npresent in the United States on behalf of the Pales-\ntine Liberation Organization or the Palestinian Au-\nthority. \n18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A). \nPlaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to support \nthe determination that Defendants have made payments \nafter April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals killed \nwhile committing acts of terrorism, and that those pay-\nments were made because the individual engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals. \nDefendants have a practice of making payments to the \nfamilies of individuals who died while committing acts of \nterrorism. The Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d) has adminis-\ntered monthly payments to the families of individuals who \ndied while committing acts of terrorism since at least 1994. \n(Declaration of Arieh Spitzen (\u201cSpitzen Declaration\u201d), \nECF No. 1020, at \u00b6 8, 10.) Defendants have control over \nthe payment program and are responsible for its opera-\ntion. (Id. at \u00b6 28.) These payments, known as \u201cshahids,\u201d \nare administered by the Institution for Families of Mar-\ntyrs and the Injured (the \u201cInstitution\u201d). (Id. at \u00b6 12.) Pay-\nment of shahids is made pursuant to a \u201cSocial Examina-\ntion\u201d form submitted by the families of the deceased ter-\nrorists and reviewed by the Institution\u2019s staff. (Id. at \u00b6 13.) \nDefendants have continued making payments to the \nfamilies of individuals killed while committing acts of ter-\nrorism after April 18, 2020. On June 8, 2020, the Prime \n\n86a \n \n \nMinister of Palestine stated \u201cwe continued to pay the pris-\noner and the families of the martyrs in full.\u201d (Middle East \nResearch Institute Special Dispatch dated June 11, 2020, \nECF No. 1020-7, at 1.) Additionally, reports from the \nState Department confirm that Defendants have contin-\nued making shahid payments since October 2020. (Article \ndated October 30, 2020, ECF No 1018-28, at 1.) \nDefendants have made shahid payments to the families \nof individuals killed while committing acts of terrorism be-\ncause of the death of the individual or \u201cmartyrdom.\u201d The \nfamilies of individuals who died in terror attacks would not \nbe eligible for shahid payments from the Institution ab-\nsent the individual\u2019s death. (Id. at 12.) To receive shahid \npayments, the family of deceased terrorists must submit a \nSocial Examination form with information about the de-\nceased, the date, place, and circumstances of their death, \nand proof of their death. (Id. at \u00b6 13.) In one such applica-\ntion, which was approved, the Institution staff wrote in a \nsection titled \u201cDepartment Recommendations\u201d that the \ndeceased \u201cwas martyred during a heroic martyrdom oper-\nation against the Zionists in the occupied city of Jerusa-\nlem\u201d and \u201c[t]herefore, we recommend that she is consid-\nered one of the al-Awsa Intifada martyrs according to the \nregulations.\u201d (Id. at 5.) \nDefendants have made shahid payments on behalf of \nindividuals who died during an act of terrorism that \nharmed injured U.S. nationals. For example, Wafa Idris \ndied on January 27, 2020 while committing an act of terror-\nism. (Spitzen Declaration \u00b6 45; Declaration of Kent A. \nYalowitz (\u201cYalowitz Declaration\u201d), ECF No. 1018, at \u00b6 78.) \nThe attack injured five U.S. nationals: Mark Sokolow, \nElana Sokolow, Jamie Sokolow, Lauren Sokolow, and \nRena Sokolow. (Yalowitz Declaration at \u00b6 77.) An appli-\ncation for shahid was filed by Idris\u2019 mother with the \n\n87a \n \n \nInstitution for Families of Martyrs and the Injured. \n(Wafa Idris Social Examination, ECF No. 1020-13, at 1.) \nThe application was approved. (Id. at 5.) A shahid pay-\nment of 600 shekels a month was allocated. (Id.) \nAs Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to show that \nDefendants conduct meets the factual predicate in 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a72334(e)(l)(A)(ii) has been met, the PSJVTA is ap-\nplicable to this case.3 \nIII. THE PSJVTA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL \nThe PSJVTA states that Defendants are \u201cdeemed to \nconsent to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they meet any of the \nfactual predicates identified in 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A) or \n(B). \nDefendant argues that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the \nPSJVTA violates the due process clause of the Constitu-\ntion because it does not reflect a free and voluntary relin-\nquishment of Defendants\u2019 right to personal jurisdiction. \n(Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Brief on the PSJVTA in Fuld \net al. v. PLO et al., 20 Civ 3374, ECF No. 42, at 5.) Defend-\nants contend that for the conduct identified in the PSJVTA \nto reflect an agreement to consent to the forum\u2019s exercise \nof personal jurisdiction over it, Defendants must receive a \nreciprocal benefit in exchange. (Id. at 6-7.) Since the stat-\nute does not confer any benefit on Defendants, Defendants \nargue that the PSJVTA represents an unconstitutional \nimposition of personal jurisdiction. (Id. at 7.) \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the PSJVTA\u2019s \ndeemed consent provision establishes constitutionally \nvalid personal jurisdiction over Defendants on the basis of \n \n3 Having determined that the PSJVTA applies under 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A)(ii), this Court does not reach the issue of whether the \nfactual predicates in 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A)(ii) or 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(l)(B) have been met. \n\n88a \n \n \nimplied consent. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defs.\u2019 Supp. \nBrief (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Response\u201d), ECF No. 1035, at 4.) Plain-\ntiffs argue that the doctrine of implied consent does not \nrequire that Defendants receive a reciprocal benefit for \nthe Court\u2019s exercise of judicial power to be constitu-\ntional.  (Id. at 6.) Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants\u2019 \ndecision to engage in conduct identified by the statute was \nknowing and voluntary. (Id.) Plaintiffs contend that De-\nfendants\u2019 decision to engage in the conduct that triggered \nthe application of the PSJVTA amounts to a legal submis-\nsion that Defendants have impliedly consented to personal \njurisdiction. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response at 4.) \nUnder the due process clause of the Constitution, \ncourts may not exercise judicial power over a defendant \nwhere maintenance of the suit offends traditional notions \nof fair play and substantial justice. Daimler AG v. Bau-\nman, 571 U.S. 117, 126 (2014). The requirement that courts \nhave personal jurisdiction over defendants represents a \nrestriction on judicial power as a matter of individual lib-\nerty. Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704 (1982). As an individual right, \npersonal jurisdiction can be waived by a defendant. (Id.) \nA court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant \ncomports with due process where defendant has sufficient \ncontacts with the forum to support general or specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Daimler, 571 U.S. at 126. A court may \nalso exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, even \nabsent minimum contacts, where the defendant consents \nto the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 704. \nThe conduct identified in the PSJVTA is insufficient to \nsupport a finding that Defendants have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction. A defendant may consent to a court\u2019s \njurisdiction expressly or by implication. Id. at 703-4. \n\n89a \n \n \nCourts have found that a defendant constructively con-\nsents to a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction where defendants \nrefuses to comply with discovery orders regarding per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Hammond Packing Co. v. State of Ark., \n212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909). Specifically, where a defendant \nviolates court orders requiring them to produce evidence \nmaterial to the issue of personal jurisdiction, courts have \ntaken that conduct as a legal submission to support a pre-\nsumption of the fact that \u201cthe refusal to produce evi-\ndence material to the administration of due process was \nbut an admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d Id. The Hammond Court found that this pre-\nsumption was like \u201cmany other presumptions attached \nby law to the failure of a party to a cause to specially set \nup or assert his supposed rights in the mode prescribed \nby law.\u201d Id. The presumption did not violate due pro-\ncess because it was based on the \u201cundoubted right of the \nlawmaking power to create a presumption of fact as to \nthe bad faith and untruth of an answer to be gotten from \nthe suppression or failure to produce the proof ordered, \nwhen such proof concerned the rightful decision of the \ncause.\u201d Id. \nHere, the parties do not dispute that Defendants\u2019 \nconduct m making payments to individuals killed while \ncommitting acts of terrorism that killed U.S. Nationals \ntriggers application of the PSJVTA. (Supra at II.) This \nconduct is wholly unrelated to any court order in this lit-\nigation. Jurisdictional discovery took place in this case \nin 2008. Defendants did not violate any discovery or-\nders. Accordingly, Defendants actions in violation of \nthe statute is insufficiently related to the litigation to \nenable the court to exercise constitutionally valid \n\n90a \n \n \npersonal jurisdiction over Defendants on the basis of \nconstructive or implied consent.4 \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants\u2019 decision to make \npayments that trigger the application of the PSNTA \nrepresents a legal submission to this Court that Defend-\nants have impliedly consented to personal jurisdiction. \n(Plaintiffs\u2019 Response at 4.) In support of its argument, \nPlaintiffs cite Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des \nBauxites de Guinee. In Ins. Corp. of Ireland, the trial \ncourt sanctioned the defendant for violating discovery or-\nders under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure by taking as established the fact that the de-\nfendant in that case had sufficient contacts with the forum \nto support personal jurisdiction, which is what plaintiff \nwas trying to prove through discovery. Ins. Corp of Ire-\nland, 456 U.S. at 705-7. Affirming the trial court, the Su-\npreme Court found that the sanction did not violate due \nprocess because the facts of the case supported a Ham-\nmond Packing presumption, and \u201cthe sanction was spe-\ncifically related to the particular \u2018claim\u2019 at issue in the or-\nder to provide discovery.\u201d (Id at 706.) The conduct Plain-\ntiffs point to, making shahid payments, does not support a \n \n4 See also Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 20-CV-3374 \n(JMF), 2022 WL 62088, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2022) (finding the \nPSJVTA did not constitutionally provide for personal jurisdiction \nover the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Au-\nthority on the basis of implied consent because \u201cthe conduct to \nwhich Congress attached jurisdictional consequence in the \nPSJVTA is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the fiction\u2019 that \n[d)efendants actually consented to the jurisdiction of the Court\u201d \nand inferring consent from \u2018martyr payments\u2019 \u201cthat have no direct \nconnection to the United States, let alone litigation in a United \nStates court - would strain the idea of consent beyond its breaking \npoint\u201d). \n\n91a \n \n \nHammond Packing presumption.5 The conduct at issue is \nunrelated to the underlying issues in the litigation, nor \nwould the sanction of finding personal jurisdiction be spe-\ncifically related to any court order. Contra Ins. Corp of \nIreland, 456 U.S. at 703-4 (no due process violation where \npersonal jurisdiction is based on a presumption of fact re-\nsulting from defendant\u2019s refusal to comply with discovery \norders). Accordingly, finding that Defendants have im-\npliedly consented to personal jurisdiction based solely on \ntheir conduct in violation of the PSJVTA would violate the \ndue process clause of the constitution.6 \n \n5 Nor could this Court make such a finding, as the Second Circuit \nalready held, that there were insufficient contacts to support general \nor specific jurisdiction in this case. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 344 (find-\ning that general jurisdiction did not exist over defendants because \nthey were not at home in New York; specific jurisdiction did not exist \nbecause the terror attacks at issue were not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States, deaths and injuries suffered by U.S. nationals were \nrandom, and lobbying activities regarding American policy toward \nIsrael are insufficiently suit-related). \n6 In addition to its support for Plaintiffs arguments, in its memo-\nrandum of law in intervention, the Government contends that fed-\neral courts must accord deference to the PSJVTA because the stat-\nute represents an enactment by Congress and the President in the \nfield of foreign affairs. (Govt. Mem ISO PSNTA at 13.) The Gov-\nernment cites Bank Marzai v. Peterson in support. In that case, \nthe Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]n pursuit of foreign policy objec-\ntives, the political branches have regulated specific foreign-state \nassets by, inter alia, blocking them or governing their availability \nfor attachment ... Such measures have never been rejected as in-\nvasions of the Article HI judicial power.\u201d Bank Markazi v. Peter-\nson, 578 U.S. 212, 235(2016). As this Court finds that the PSNTA is \nunconstitutional for its violation of the due process clause, not for \nits invasion of the separation of powers, the Government\u2019s argu-\nment is inapplicable. \n\n92a \n \n \nIV.

FURMAN, United States District Judge: \nThe Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments have long been interpreted to mean that a \nparty cannot be subjected to the jurisdiction of a forum\u2019s \ncourts unless the party has certain minimum contacts with \nthe forum. Courts have recognized three independent ba-\nses for such \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d: first, general jurisdic-\ntion, when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with the forum in \nwhich suit is brought are so constant and pervasive as to \nrender it essentially at home in the forum; second, specific \njurisdiction, when there is a sufficient connection between \nthe underlying controversy and the forum; and third, a de-\nfendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent, whether ex-\npress or implied, to suit in the forum. \nTo date, courts have held that these bases are insuffi-\ncient to sustain lawsuits brought by family members of \nAmerican victims of terrorist attacks in Israel and the oc-\ncupied territories under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 \n(\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 et seq., against the Palestine \n\n94a \n \n \nLiberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian Au-\nthority (\u201cPA\u201d). In 2019, Congress responded to these rul-\nings by enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \ndiv. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, which includes innova-\ntive provisions intended to ensure that such lawsuits are \nnot dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction. Specifi-\ncally, the statute provides that the PLO and PA would be \n\u201cdeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any \ncase brought under the ATA if, after a date certain, they \nengaged in specified conduct \u2014 conduct in which they had \nlong engaged. \nThe novel question presented in this case \u2014 brought \nby the family members of a Jewish American killed in a \n2018 terrorist attack in Gush Etzion, a settlement located \nin the West Bank, against the PLO and the PA for their \nalleged roles in encouraging and supporting the attack \u2014 \nis whether this \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction is consistent \nwith the requirements of due process. For the reasons that \nfollow, the Court concludes that it is not. In brief, Con-\ngress cannot, consistent with the Constitution, simply de-\ncree that any conduct, without regard for its connections \nto the United States generally or to litigation in the United \nStates specifically, signals a party\u2019s intent to submit to the \njurisdiction of a United States court. To hold otherwise \nwould effectively mean that there are no constitutional \nlimitations on the exercise of personal jurisdiction as a leg-\nislature could simply create such jurisdiction out of whole \ncloth by deeming any conduct \u2014 even, for example, the \nconduct that gives rise to the cause of action itself \u2014 to be \n\u201cconsent.\u201d The Court cannot and will not acquiesce in \nwhat amounts to a legislative sleight of hand at the ex-\npense of a fundamental constitutional right and, thus, is \ncompelled to grant the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s motion to dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. \n\n95a \n \n \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs in this case are the wife and four children of \nAri Yoel Fuld, an American citizen who, on September 16, \n2018, was brutally stabbed to death outside a mall in Gush \nEtzion, a settlement located in the West Bank. See ECF \nNo. 21 (\u201cAm. Compl.\u201d), \u00b6\u00b6 106-110. Plaintiffs allege, on in-\nformation and belief, that Khalil Yousef Ali Jabarin, the \nmurderer, targeted Fuld because he was a Jewish Ameri-\ncan. See id. \u00b6 107; see also id. \u00b6 101 (alleging, on infor-\nmation and belief, that Jabarin \u201cdecided to become . . . a \n\u2018martyr[]\u2019 and kill Jews\u201d). In this suit, however, they do \nnot seek relief from Jabarin (who was apprehended by Is-\nraeli authorities after the murder). Instead, they seek \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the PA, \nwhich was established by the 1993 Oslo Accords to exer-\ncise interim governance authority for the Palestinian peo-\nple in Gaza and the West Bank, and the PLO, which has \nbeen recognized by the United Nations as the representa-\ntive of the Palestinian people, on the ground that they \u201cen-\ncouraged, incentivized, and assisted\u201d the attack on Fuld. \nId. \u00b6 4. They do so principally pursuant to the ATA, as \namended by the PSJVTA. See id. \u00b6 1. \nCongress enacted the ATA in 1992 in an effort \u201cto de-\nvelop a comprehensive legal response to international ter-\nrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992) (\u201c1992 House \nReport\u201d); see Pub. L. No. 102-572, \u00a7 1003(a), 106 Stat. \n4506, 4521-24 (1992) (adding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2331, 2333-2338). \nThe statute created a civil damages remedy for United \nStates nationals harmed by an act of international terror-\nism committed by a foreign terrorist organization. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). To the extent relevant here, it permits \nsuch United States nationals to sue \u201cany person who aids \nand abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, \nor who conspires [to commit] an act of international ter-\nrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). Among other things, it provides \n\n96a \n \n \nfor treble damages plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See id. \n\u00a7 2333(a). \nIn 2004, a group of eleven American families (the \n\u201cSokolow plaintiffs\u201d) sued the PA and PLO under the ATA \nfor various terrorist attacks in Israel. See Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317, 322, 324 (2d Cir. \n2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d). The PA and PLO moved repeatedly \nto dismiss the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction, but the district court denied their mo-\ntions, reasoning that \u201cthe totality of activities in the United \nStates by the PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of gen-\neral personal jurisdiction.\u201d Sokolow v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2011), vacated sub nom. Waldman I, \n835 F.3d 317. After more than a decade of litigation and a \nseven-week trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the \nSokolow plaintiffs and awarded them more than $650 mil-\nlion pursuant to the ATA\u2019s treble damages provision. See \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 322, 326. \nIn the meantime, in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014), the Supreme Court clarified that \u201cgeneral\u201d \npersonal jurisdiction is appropriate only in a forum where \nthe defendant is \u201cessentially at home,\u201d which, in the case \nof a non-natural person, is usually limited to its place of in-\ncorporation or principal place of business, see id. at 136-\n39. In the wake of Daimler, the Second Circuit vacated \nthe judgment in Sokolow, holding in Waldman I that the \ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over the \nPA and PLO had violated the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment because neither defendant was \u201cat \nhome\u201d in the United States and the terrorist attacks at is-\nsue \u201cwere not sufficiently connected to the United States\u201d \nto support \u201cspecific personal jurisdiction.\u201d 835 F.3d at 337. \nIn a trio of similar cases against the PA and PLO, the D.C. \n\n97a \n \n \nCircuit reached the same conclusions. See Shatsky v. Pal-\nestine Liberation Org., 955 F.3d 1016, 1036-37 (D.C. Cir. \n2020); Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d \n1115, 1123-24 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. granted, judgment va-\ncated, 140 S. Ct. 2713 (2020), and opinion reinstated in \npart, No. 15-7034, 2020 WL 5361653 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 18, \n2020); Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 56-57 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017). \nIn 2018, Congress responded to these decisions by en-\nacting the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184 (adding 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)). Section 4 of the ATCA provided that, \n\u201cfor purposes of any civil action under [the ATA], a defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction in such civil action if,\u201d after January 31, 2019, the \ndefendant \u201caccepts\u201d certain \u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from \nthe United States or maintains an office within the United \nStates pursuant to a waiver or suspension of 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 5202 (which otherwise prohibits the PLO from maintain-\ning an office in the United States). Id. Within days of the \nATCA\u2019s enactment, the Sokolow plaintiffs filed a motion \nasking the Second Circuit to recall the mandate in Wald-\nman I, arguing that Section 4 of the ATCA provided per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PA and PLO. See Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 925 F.3d 570, 574 (2d Cir. 2019) \n(per curiam) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d), cert. granted, judgment va-\ncated sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 140 \nS. Ct. 2714 (2020). The Second Circuit denied their motion, \nfinding that the plaintiffs had failed to show \u201cthat either \nfactual predicate of Section 4 of the ACTA ha[d] been sat-\nisfied.\u201d Id. Once again, the D.C. Circuit reached the same \nconclusions. See Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1128. \nThe plaintiffs in these cases filed petitions for certio-\nrari in the Supreme Court. On December 20, 2019, while \n\n98a \n \n \ntheir petitions were pending, Congress intervened again \nby passing the PSJVTA. To the extent relevant here, the \nPSJVTA superseded the personal jurisdiction provisions \nin the ATCA. It amended the definition of \u201cdefendant\u201d to \nspecifically include the PA, the PLO, and their affiliates \nand successors. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903(b)(5), 133 Stat. 3082, 3083. And it provided two new \nfactual predicates for conduct that will be \u201cdeemed\u201d con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction for civil actions under the \nATA. As amended by the PSJVTA, the ATA now pro-\nvides, first, that a defendant \u201cshall be deemed to have con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in ATA cases if, after April \n18, 2020, it \u201cmakes any payment, directly or indirectly,\u201d to \neither (i) a payee designated by someone imprisoned for \nan act of terrorism that injured or killed an American na-\ntional \u201cif such payment is made by reason of such impris-\nonment\u201d or (ii) to a family member of an individual who \ndied while committing an act of terrorism that injured or \nkilled an American national \u201cif such payment is made by \nreason of the death of such individual.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). Second, the Act states that a defendant \nwill be \u201cdeemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d if, after January 4, 2020, it \u201cestablishes,\u201d \u201cprocures,\u201d \nor \u201ccontinues to maintain any office, headquarters, prem-\nises, or other facilities or establishments in the United \nStates,\u201d or \u201cconducts any activity while physically present \nin the United States on behalf of\u201d the PLO or the PA. Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). That subsection is subject to several ex-\nceptions, including, most notably, offices or facilities used \n\u201cexclusively for the purpose of conducting official business \nof the United Nations\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d activities. Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nOn April 27, 2020, the Supreme Court granted certio-\nrari to both the Sokolow plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the \nD.C. Circuit litigation, vacated the lower court judgments, \n\n99a \n \n \nand remanded the cases \u201cfor further consideration in light \nof the [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714; see Klie-\nman, 140 S. Ct. at 2713. Thereafter, the Second Circuit \nremanded Sokolow to the district court \u201cfor the limited \npurpose of determining the applicability of the PSJVTA to \n[that] case, and, if the PSJVTA is determined to apply, any \nissues regarding its application to [that] case including its \nconstitutionality.\u201d Mandate, Waldman v. Palestine Liber-\nation Org., No. 15-3135 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2020), ECF No. \n369. On remand, the parties (and the United States) have \nbriefed both issues. See Sokolow v. Palestinian Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD) (S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2015), \nECF Nos. 1015, 1021, 1022, 1043.1 \nIn the meantime, Plaintiffs filed this suit on April 30, \n2020, three days after the Supreme Court vacated and re-\nmanded in Sokolow. See ECF No. 1. In their Amended \nComplaint, Plaintiffs allege that both prongs of the \nPSJVTA\u2019s personal jurisdiction provisions are satisfied. \nFirst, they allege that, after April 18, 2020, Defendants \nmade payments to the families of deceased terrorists who \nkilled or injured Americans and to the designees of terror-\nists who pleaded guilty or were fairly convicted of killing \nor injuring Americans. See Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-57, 59, 60, \n \n1 The Shatksy and Klieman plaintiffs are also still pursuing their \nclaims in light of the PSJVTA. In conjunction with their litigation in \nthe D.C. Circuit, the Shatsky plaintiffs also filed a \u201cprotective action\u201d \nin this Court. See Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 18-CV-\n12355 (MKV) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2020), ECF No. 21, at 1. In that pro-\nceeding, Defendants have also moved to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction, and their motion remains pending. See Shatsky v. Pales-\ntine Liberation Org., No. 18-CV-12355 (MKV) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, \n2021), ECF No. 116. Meanwhile, the Klieman plaintiffs are seeking \njurisdictional discovery before the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia. See Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. \n04-CV-1173 (PLF) (D.D.C. Dec. 2, 2020), ECF No. 298. \n\n100a \n \n \n62-67, 114-115.2 Second, they allege that, after January 4, \n2020, Defendants provided consular services in the United \nStates, and conducted press-conferences, distributed in-\nformational materials, and engaged the United States me-\ndia in order to influence American foreign policy and pub-\nlic opinion. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 68-90. They further allege that, after \nJanuary 4, 2020, Defendants maintained offices in the \nUnited States that were not used exclusively for the pur-\npose of conducting official United Nations business. See \nid. \u00b6\u00b6 75-95. \nAfter Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, the PA \nand PLO moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand for failure to state a claim. See ECF No. 24. For rea-\nsons not relevant here, the Court directed the parties to \nfile supplemental briefs as to the \u201capplication and consti-\ntutionality of the PSJVTA.\u201d ECF No. 34. Additionally, af-\nter confirming that the PA and PLO sought to challenge \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA, the Court, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Rule 5.1(b) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, certified the constitutional challenge to \nthe Attorney General of the United States and invited him \nto intervene.

And, at \n\n102a \n \n \nleast for purposes of this motion, Defendants do not dis-\npute Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they have made payments \nthat trigger the PSJVTA\u2019s first \u201cdeemed consent\u201d condi-\ntion. See Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63, 66-67.3 Thus, as in Waldman \nI, whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over De-\nfendants in this case is proper turns on \u201cwhether the third \njurisdictional requirement is met \u2014 whether jurisdiction \nover the [D]efendants may be exercised consistent with \nthe Constitution.\u201d 835 F.3d at 328. \nIn general, due process \u2014 pursuant to both the Fifth \nand the Fourteenth Amendments, see id.

By contrast, Defendants \ndo contest Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the PSJVTA\u2019s second \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d prong has been met. See, e.g., Defs.\u2019 Mem. 21-25; ECF No. \n50 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Reply\u201d), at 7-10. Because the Court concludes that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s first prong has been met, it need not decide whether De-\nfendants\u2019 conduct also implicates the second prong. \n\n103a \n \n \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316-17 (1945)). \nMore specifically, there are three traditional bases for per-\nsonal jurisdiction that comport with constitutional due \nprocess principles. First, a court may exercise \u201cgeneral \njurisdiction\u201d over a foreign defendant \u201cwhen the defend-\nant\u2019s affiliations with the State in which suit is brought are \nso constant and pervasive as to render it essentially at \nhome in the forum State.\u201d Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 331 \n(cleaned up). In such cases, jurisdiction encompasses \u201cany \nand all claims against that defendant.\u201d Id. Second, a court \nmay exercise \u201cspecific or conduct-linked jurisdiction\u201d \nwhere there is a sufficient \u201caffiliation between the forum \nand the underlying controversy, principally, activity or an \noccurrence that takes place in the forum state and is there-\nfore subject to the State\u2019s regulation.\u201d Sonera Holding \nB.V. v. Cukurova Holding A.S., 750 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. \n2014) (cleaned up). In other words, \u201cto exercise jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process, the defendant\u2019s suit-re-\nlated conduct must create a substantial connection with \nthe forum.\u201d Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1122 (2014). \nIn this case, Plaintiffs make no argument for general \nor specific jurisdiction, and for good reasons: Any such ar-\ngument would be foreclosed by the Second Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion in Waldman I. First, to the extent relevant here, the \nSecond Circuit held in Waldman I that the neither the PA \nnor the PLO can be fairly regarded as \u201cat home\u201d in the \nUnited States for purposes of general jurisdiction; in-\nstead, both \u201care \u2018at home\u2019 in Palestine, where these enti-\nties are headquartered and from where they are directed.\u201d \nSee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 332-34; see also Shatsky, 955 \nF.3d at 1036 (\u201cThe Palestinian Authority and the PLO are \nnot subject to general jurisdiction because neither one is \n\u2018at home\u2019 in the District of Columbia within the meaning of \nDaimler.\u201d). Second, the Waldman I Court held that the \nalleged tortious actions by the PA and the PLO, \u201cas \n\n104a \n \n \nheinous as they were, were not sufficiently connected to \nthe United States to provide specific personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. There is no basis to conclude that the \ndefendants participated in these acts in the United States \nor that their liability for these acts resulted from their ac-\ntions that did occur in the United States.\u201d 835 F.3d at 337. \nThese conclusions apply, with equal force, to this case.4 It \nfollows that the Court cannot \u201cconstitutionally exercise ei-\nther general or specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants in this case.\u201d Id. at 344. \nInstead of relying on general or specific jurisdiction, \nPlaintiffs here rely entirely on the third traditional basis \nfor personal jurisdiction: consent. See, e.g., J. McIntyre \nMach., Ltd. v. Nicasto, 564 U.S. 873, 880 (2011) (plurality \nopinion); Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n \n4 An argument could be made \u2014 although, conspicuously, Plaintiffs \ndo not make it \u2014 that this case is distinguishable from Waldman I \nbecause here the Amended Complaint alleges, on information and be-\nlief, that the attacker specifically \u201ctargeted\u201d the victim \u201cbecause he \nwas a Jewish American.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 107; cf. Waldman I, 835 F.3d \nat 343-44 (holding that there was no specific jurisdiction in part \u201cbe-\ncause the terror attacks in Israel at issue . . . were not expressly aimed \nat the United States and because the deaths and injuries suffered by \nthe American plaintiffs in these attacks were random and fortuitous\u201d \n(internal quotation marks omitted)). But the sole factual basis for the \nallegation \u2014 namely, that Jabarin \u201cdeduced\u201d Fuld \u201cwas a Jew and an \nAmerican\u201d on the basis of the latter\u2019s \u201cskullcap\u201d having \u201cbold English \nlettering on it,\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 107 \u2014 is too \u201cconclusory and insufficient \nfor specific personal jurisdiction purposes,\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks on \nSept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, 676 (2d Cir. 2013); see also Waldman I, \n835 F.3d at 338 (rejecting the argument that \u201cDefendants intended to \nhit American citizens\u201d on that ground that \u201cit would be impermissible \nto speculate based on scant evidence what the terrorists intended to \ndo\u201d (emphasis omitted)). In any event, Plaintiffs have forfeited any \nargument in favor of specific jurisdiction. See, e.g., Delgado v. Vil-\nlanueva, No. 12-CV-3113 (JMF), 2013 WL 3009649, at *2 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y.

Allied Van Lines, \nInc., 900 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1990).5 Unlike subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, \u201cpersonal jurisdiction represents . . . \nan individual right,\u201d which \u201ccan, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites \nde Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 (1982) (\u201cBauxites\u201d). Thus, \nthe Supreme Court has acknowledged \u201c[a] variety of legal \narrangements\u201d that \u201chave been taken to represent ex-\npress or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the \ncourt.\u201d Id. The archetypal example of express consent \noccurs when \u201cparties to a contract . . . agree in advance to \nsubmit to the jurisdiction of a given court.\u201d Id. at 704 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). Examples of \u201clegal ar-\nrangements\u201d that constitute \u201cimplied\u201d consent are (1) a \nparty\u2019s agreement to arbitrate, see id. (citing Victory \nTransp. Inc. v. Comisaria Gen. de Abastecimientos y \nTransportes, 336 F.2d 354, 363 (2d Cir. 1964) (\u201cBy agree-\ning to arbitrate in New York, where the United States Ar-\nbitration Act makes such agreements specifically enforce-\nable, [the respondent] must be deemed to have consented \nto the jurisdiction of the court that could compel the arbi-\ntration proceeding in New York.\u201d)); and (2) \u201cstate proce-\ndures which find constructive consent to the personal ju-\nrisdiction of the state court in the voluntary use of certain \nstate procedures,\u201d id. (citing Adam v.

Thus, the Court need not and does not address the issue \nhere. \n\n106a \n \n \naction against a plaintiff in its courts.\u201d)). Additionally, the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a defendant \nwaives any defense based on lack of personal jurisdiction \n\u2014 and, in that sense, \u201cconsents\u201d to personal jurisdiction \n\u2014 by failing to raise the issue either in an answer or in an \ninitial motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1); see Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 704. \nSignificantly, the reason that consent suffices to sup-\nport personal jurisdiction is rooted in the fact that \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause.\u201d Id. \nat 694. \u201cThe personal jurisdiction requirement recognizes \nand protects an individual liberty interest.\u201d Id. at 702. If \na party consents to appear in a particular forum, whether \nexplicitly or implicitly, it follows that \u201cmaintenance of the \nsuit\u201d in that forum does \u201cnot offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). \u201cThe \nactions of the defendant . . . amount to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Id. at 704-05. After all, \n\u201c[c]onsent, by its very nature, constitutes \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018ac-\nceptance.\u2019\u201d WorldCare Corp. v. World Ins. Co., 767 F. \nSupp. 2d 341, 355 (D. Conn. 2011) (quoting Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary definition of \u201cconsent\u201d as \u201c[a]greement, ap-\nproval, or permission as to some act or purpose, esp. given \nvoluntarily by a competent person; legally effective as-\nsent\u201d). Put differently, like presence in a forum that is suf-\nficient to support general jurisdiction, consent \u201creveals \ncircumstances . . . from which it is proper to infer an inten-\ntion to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the \nlaws of the forum.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 \n(plurality opinion) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Shaffer \nv. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 203-04 (1977) (describing cases in \nwhich the Court \u201cpurported . . . to identify circumstances \nunder which . . . consent [could] be attributed to [a foreign \ndefendant]\u201d as an \u201cattempt[] to ascertain what dealings \n\n107a \n \n \nmake it just to subject a foreign corporation to local suit\u201d \n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nThat inference is reasonable, however, only where the \ndefendant\u2019s statements or conduct actually signal ap-\nproval or acceptance. That, in turn, requires the \u201cconsent\u201d \nto meet certain minimum requirements. Thus, the law \ngenerally requires the party\u2019s consent to be \u201cknowing and \nvoluntary\u201d before it is treated as effective. See, e.g., In re \nAsbestos Prods. Liab. Litig. (No. VI), 384 F. Supp. 3d 532, \n538 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (\u201cIt is axiomatic . . . that consent is only \nvalid if it is given both knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d). After \nall, if a party giving consent does not understand the con-\nsequences of its actions or lacks the ability to withhold con-\nsent, it cannot be said that its \u201cconsent\u201d signals anything, \nlet alone \u201can intention to submit to the laws of the forum.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion). Re-\nlatedly, courts may not enforce a party\u2019s express consent \nto personal jurisdiction where doing so \u201cwould be unrea-\nsonable and unjust,\u201d M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., \n407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972), or where the agreement was affected \nby \u201cfraud, undue influence, or overweening bargaining \npower,\u201d id. at 13; see also id. at 10-11 (noting that these \nlimits are \u201cmerely the other side of the proposition . . . that \nin federal courts a party may validly consent to be sued in \na jurisdiction where he cannot be found\u201d). And for conduct \nto imply consent, the conduct must be \u201cof such a nature as \nto justify the fiction\u201d that the party actually consented to \nsubmit itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 \nU.S. at 318. Put simply, for waiver of personal jurisdiction \nthrough consent to satisfy the requirements of due pro-\ncess, it \u201cmust be willful, thoughtful, and fair. \u2018Extorted ac-\ntual consent\u2019 and \u2018equally unwilling implied consent\u2019 are \nnot the stuff of due process.\u201d Leonard v. USA Petroleum \nCorp., 829 F. Supp. 882, 889 (S.D. Tex. 1993). \n\n108a \n \n \nMeasured against these standards, the PSJVTA does \nnot constitutionally provide for personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants in this case. Congress simply took conduct in \nwhich the PLO and PA had previously engaged \u2014 conduct \nthat the Second and D.C. Circuits had held was insufficient \nto support personal jurisdiction in Waldman I, Livnat, \nShatsky, and Klieman \u2014 and declared that such conduct \n\u201cshall be deemed\u201d to be consent. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); \nsee, e.g., Shatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, 1037 (holding that \nalleged \u201cmartyr payments\u201d did not confer specific jurisdic-\ntion over Defendants). But the conduct to which Congress \nattached jurisdictional consequence in the PSJVTA is not \n\u201cof such a nature as to justify the fiction\u201d that Defendants \nactually consented to the jurisdiction of the Court. Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 318. Inferring consent to jurisdiction in \nthe United States from the first prong of the \u201cdeemed con-\nsent provision\u201d \u2014 for \u201cmartyr payments,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), that have no direct connection to the \nUnited States, let alone to litigation in a United States \ncourt \u2014 would strain the idea of consent beyond its break-\ning point. And while the second prong \u2014 relating to offices \nor other facilities in the United States and activities \u201cwhile \nphysically \npresent \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B) \u2014 does relate to conduct in the United \nStates, the conduct (at least as alleged in this case) is too \nthin to support a meaningful inference of consent to juris-\ndiction in this country. Neither form of conduct, as alleged \nin this case, even remotely signals approval or acceptance \nof the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Nor do they support an infer-\nence that Defendants intended \u201cto submit to the laws of \nthe [United States]\u201d or to the jurisdiction of an American \ncourt. J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opin-\nion). It may be that, under different circumstances, Con-\ngress or a state legislature could constitutionally \u201cdeem\u201d \ncertain conduct to be consent to personal jurisdiction. \n\n109a \n \n \n(The Court need not and does not decide that question \nhere.) To pass muster, however, the predicate conduct \nwould have to be a much closer proxy for actual consent \nthan the predicate conduct at issue is here. To be blunt: \nThe PSJVTA is too cute by half to satisfy the require-\nments of due process here. \nThat conclusion finds strong support in College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). The question there \nwas whether a state could be deemed to have waived its \nEleventh Amendment immunity from suit merely by en-\ngaging in conduct that violated federal law. The Supreme \nCourt held that it could not because \u201cthere is little reason \nto assume actual consent based upon the State\u2019s mere \npresence in a field subject to congressional regulation.\u201d \nId. at 680. \u201cThere is a fundamental difference,\u201d the Court \nobserved, \u201cbetween a State\u2019s expressing unequivocally \nthat it waives its immunity and Congress\u2019s expressing un-\nequivocally its intention that if the State takes certain ac-\ntion it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d Id. \nat 680-81. In the former situation, the state has voluntarily \nconsented to suit. \u201cIn the latter situation, the most that \ncan be said with certainty is that the State has been put on \nnotice that Congress intends to subject it to suits brought \nby individuals. That is very far from concluding that the \nState made an altogether voluntary decision to waive its \nimmunity.\u201d Id. at 681. The fact that \u201cthe asserted basis \nfor constructive waiver\u201d was \u201cconduct that the State real-\nistically could choose to abandon,\u201d the Court declared, had \n\u201cno bearing on the voluntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. at 684. \nTo be sure, College Savings Bank involved the Elev-\nenth Amendment, not the Due Process Clause of either the \nFifth or Fourteenth Amendments, and there are differ-\nences between the two contexts. Significantly, however, \n\n110a \n \n \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning was not specific to any particular \nconstitutional right. To the contrary, the Court explicitly \nnoted that constructive \u2014 i.e., \u201cdeemed\u201d \u2014 consents were \n\u201csimply unheard of in the context of other constitutionally \nprotected privileges. . . . Constructive consent is not a doc-\ntrine commonly associated with the surrender of consti-\ntutional rights.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (latter emphasis added). \nUnderscoring the point, the Court then offered an exam-\nple involving a very different constitutional right, the Sixth \nAmendment right to trial by jury: \n[I]magine if Congress amended the securities laws \nto provide with unmistakable clarity that anyone \ncommitting fraud in connection with the buying or \nselling of securities in interstate commerce would \nnot be entitled to a jury in any federal criminal \nprosecution of such fraud. Would persons engaging \nin securities fraud after the adoption of such an \namendment be deemed to have \u201cconstructively \nwaived\u201d their constitutionally protected rights to \ntrial by jury in criminal cases? After all, the trading \nof securities is not so vital an activity that any one \nperson\u2019s decision to trade cannot be regarded as a \nvoluntary choice. The answer, of course, is no. The \nclassic description of an effective waiver of a consti-\ntutional right is the intentional relinquishment or \nabandonment of a known right or privilege. Courts \nindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver of fundamental constitutional rights. \nId. at 681-82 (cleaned up). In short, the principles under-\nlying College Savings Bank are not specific to the Elev-\nenth Amendment, but rather apply to constitutional rights \nbroadly. And there is no reason to believe that they apply \nany less forcefully to the constitutional right at issue here \n\u2014 the due process right not to be subjected to suit absent \n\n111a \n \n \nsufficient \u201c\u2018contacts\u2019 with the forum,\u201d Ford Motor Co., 141 \nS. Ct. at 1024 \u2014 than they do to the Sixth Amendment jury \ntrial right. \nThus, College Savings Bank all but compels the con-\nclusion that personal jurisdiction is lacking here. Yes, \nCongress \u201cexpress[ed] unequivocally its intention that if\u201d \neither the PLO or PA \u201ctakes certain action it shall be \ndeemed to have\u201d consented to suit in an American court. \n527 U.S. at 680-81. From that fact, however, \u201cthe most \nthat can be said with certainty is that\u201d the PLO and PA \nhave \u201cbeen put on notice that Congress intends to subject \n[them] to suits\u201d in the United States. Id. at 681. \u201cThat is \nvery far from concluding that\u201d either the PLO or the PA \n\u201cmade an altogether voluntary decision to\u201d submit to such \nsuits. Id. Moreover, the fact that \u201cthe asserted basis for\u201d \ndeemed consent jurisdiction in the PSJVTA is \u201cconduct \nthat\u201d the PLO and PA \u201crealistically could choose to aban-\ndon\u201d is of no moment. Id. at 684. That fact simply has \u201cno \nbearing on the voluntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. \nThat would be enough, but a pair of recent Second Cir-\ncuit decisions concerning business registration statutes \nprovides additional support for the Court\u2019s conclusion that \nthe exercise of jurisdiction over Defendants here would vi-\nolate due process. See Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., \n814 F.3d 619, 639-41 (2d Cir. 2016); Chen v. Dunkin\u2019 \nBrands, Inc., 954 F.3d 492, 498-99 (2d Cir. 2020). In \nBrown, the Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that by \nregistering to do business in Connecticut and appointing \nan agent for service of process as required by Connecticut \nstatute, the defendant had \u201cconsented to the jurisdiction \nof Connecticut courts for all purposes.\u201d 814 F.3d at 630. \nIn Chen, the Court held the same with respect to registra-\ntion under New York law. See 954 F.3d at 499. Most rele-\nvant here, the Court did so in part because giving \u201cbroader \n\n112a \n \n \neffect\u201d to the registration statutes \u201cwould implicate Due \nProcess and other constitutional concerns.\u201d Brown, 814 \nF.3d at 626; accord Chen, 954 F.3d at 498-99. \u201cIf mere reg-\nistration and the accompanying appointment of an in-state \nagent \u2014 without an express consent to general jurisdic-\ntion \u2014 nonetheless sufficed to confer general jurisdiction \nby implicit consent,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cevery corpora-\ntion would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state \nin which it registered, and Daimler\u2019s ruling would be \nrobbed of meaning by a back- door thief.\u201d Brown, 814 F.3d \nat 640; accord Chen, 954 F.3d at 499. \nAdmittedly, Brown and Chen do not speak directly to \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA. The plaintiffs in both \ncases argued that the statutes at issue gave rise to general \njurisdiction. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs and the United \nStates make no such argument, as the PSJVTA\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional provisions are specific to claims against Defendants \nunder the ATA. Moreover, the statutes at issue in Brown \nand Chen were not explicit in deeming registration to be \nconsent. The PSJVTA, of course, is. In point of fact, \nBrown and Chen explicitly left open the possibility \u201cthat a \ncarefully drawn state statute that expressly required con-\nsent to general jurisdiction as a condition on a foreign cor-\nporation\u2019s doing business in the state, at least in cases \nbrought by state residents, might well be constitutional,\u201d \nBrown, 814 F.3d at 641 (emphasis added), and ultimately \ndid not reach the question squarely presented here, \nnamely whether a court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant, \u201ceven when exercised pursuant to [the \ndefendant\u2019s] purported \u2018consent,\u2019 [is] limited by the Due \nProcess clause,\u201d id.6 But the decisions strongly suggest \u2014 \n \n6 The Brown Court noted that Pennsylvania\u2019s registration statute \n\u201cmore plainly advise[d] the registrant that enrolling in the state as a \nforeign corporation and transacting business will vest the local courts \n\n113a \n \n \neven if they do not hold \u2014 that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdic-\ntion is limited by the Due Process Clause and that allowing \nCongress by legislative fiat to simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct that \nwould otherwise not support personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States to be \u201cconsent,\u201d as it tried to do here, would \n\u201crob[]\u201d the case law conditioning personal jurisdiction on \nsufficient contacts with the forum \u201cof meaning by a back-\ndoor thief.\u201d Id. at 640. \nNotably, in arguing that the PSJVTA passes constitu-\ntional muster, Plaintiffs and the United States do not dis-\npute that a statute \u201cdeeming\u201d certain conduct to be \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction must be consistent with due \nprocess. See U.S. Mem. 7-9; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13. In their view, \nhowever, to comply with due process, a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \n \nwith general jurisdiction over the corporation,\u201d 814 F.3d at 640 (citing \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i)-(ii)), and that the Third Circuit had \nheld that the statute was consistent with due process, see id. (citing \nBane v. Netlink, Inc., 925 F.2d 637, 640 (3d Cir. 1991)). (The Pennsyl-\nvania statute is apparently the only registration statute in the country \nthat is explicit in deeming registration to be consent. See Asbestos \nProds. Liab. Litig., 384 F. Supp. 3d at 539.) Notably, however, the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court recently held that, following Daimler, \nthe statutory scheme could not be squared with the Due Process \nClause. See Mallory v. Norfolk S. Rwy. Co., \u2014 A.3d \u2014, 2021 WL \n6067172, at *14-21 (Pa. Dec. 22, 2021). The Court acknowledged that \nthe state\u2019s business registration statute put foreign corporations on \nnotice that registration would be deemed consent, but concluded that \nsuch \u201cnotice . . . does not render the consent voluntary.\u201d Id. at *19. \n(In so holding, the Court rested in part on the \u201cunconstitutional con-\nditions doctrine.\u201d See id. at *20. Defendants here advert to that doc-\ntrine, but only in a footnote. See Defs.\u2019 Mem. 14 n.3. Accordingly, the \nCourt deems any argument with respect to the doctrine to have been \nabandoned. See, e.g., Fieldcamp v. City of New York, 242 F. Supp. 2d \n388, 391 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\u201c[T]he failure to provide argument on a point \nat issue constitutes abandonment of the issue.\u201d); accord Wilmington \nTr., N.A. v. 115 Owner LLC, No. 20-CV-2157 (JMF), 2021 WL \n5086368, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2021).) \n\n114a \n \n \nstatute need only give defendants \u201cfair warning about \nwhat conduct will subject them to personal jurisdiction \nwith respect to a particular class of claims, and a reasona-\nble period to structure their primary conduct with some \nminimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will \nnot render them liable to suit.\u201d U.S. Mem. 9 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13.7 If a statute does \nso, they argue, a defendant who thereafter engages in the \npredicate conduct has \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d con-\nsented to jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction over \nsuch a defendant comports with due process. As applied \nhere, Plaintiffs and the United States argue that Defend-\nants knowingly and voluntarily \u201cconsented\u201d because they \n\u201cknew\u201d the activities that would \u201cbe deemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction and were given \u201cthe opportunity to \u2018voluntar-\nily\u2019 choose whether or not to continue such activities and \nthereby consent to jurisdiction in the courts of the United \nStates.\u201d U.S. Mem. 10; see Pls.\u2019 Supp. Mem. 5. In short, in \ntheir view, nothing more than fair notice and an oppor-\ntunity to conform is required for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to sat-\nisfy due process. \nThe Court cannot agree. Separate and apart from the \nfact that the argument of Plaintiffs and the United States \nis the very one rejected by the Supreme Court in College \n \n7 Plaintiffs add that, to pass muster under the Due Process Clause, a \ndeemed consent statute also has to serve a \u201clegitimate governmental \nobjective\u201d so as to \u201cavoid[] the arbitrary or irrational exercise of \npower.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13-16 (citing Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n846 (1998)). True enough: \u201cThe touchstone of due process is protec-\ntion of the individual against arbitrary action of government.\u201d Wolff \nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974). But this additional prong adds \nlittle to Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed test (and is easily satisfied here in any \nevent), as \u201conly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be \narbitrary in the constitutional sense and therefore unconstitutional.\u201d \nTenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581, 600 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up). \nThus, the Court need not and does not address it further. \n\n115a \n \n \nSavings Bank, to accept it would effectively mean that \nthere are no due process limitations on the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Congress or a state legislature could \nprovide for jurisdiction over any defendant for any con-\nduct so long as the conduct post-dated enactment of the \nlaw at issue. That is, Congress or the legislature could \nsimply \u201cdeem\u201d a substantive violation of the law at issue to \nbe \u201cconsent\u201d and, on that basis, subject any defendant who \nlater committed a violation to jurisdiction without regard \nfor its \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations\u201d with the forum. Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 319. Congress, for example, could simply \n\u201cdeem\u201d a substantive violation of the ATA to mean that a \ndefendant had \u201cconsented\u201d to jurisdiction. Or, perhaps \nmore revealingly, a state legislature could pass a statute \ndeclaring that any foreign corporation that distributed ve-\nhicles to in-state dealerships would be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in that state \u2014 circum-\nventing the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Daimler. 571 U.S. \nat 136; cf. Coll. Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 683 (\u201cRecogniz-\ning a congressional power to exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners would also, as a practical matter, permit Congress to \ncircumvent the antiabrogation holding of Seminole Tribe \n[of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996)].\u201d). In short, to \nhold that fair notice and an opportunity to conform one\u2019s \nbehavior are the only requirements for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \njurisdiction to comport with due process would be to hold \nthat personal jurisdiction is limited only by reach of the \nlegislative imagination \u2014 which is to say, that there are no \nconstitutional limits at all. \nCongress should not be permitted to circumvent fun-\ndamental constitutional rights through such sleight of \nhand. See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. R.R. Comm\u2019n, \n271 U.S. 583, 593 (1926) (\u201c[C]onstitutional guarantees, so \ncarefully safeguarded against direct assault, [should not \n\n116a \n \n \nbe] open to destruction by the indirect but no less effective \nprocess of requiring a surrender which, though in form \nvoluntary, in fact lacks none of the elements of compul-\nsion.\u201d). Indeed, to give such power to a legislature would \nbe to violate the longstanding proposition that \u201cit was not \nleft to the legislative power to enact any process which \nmight be devised\u201d and that due process \u201ccannot be so con-\nstrued as to leave Congress free to make any process \u2018due \nprocess of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Ho-\nboken Land & Improvement Co., 59 U.S. 272, 276 (1856); \nsee Quill Corp. v. N. Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992) (not-\ning that Congress does not \u201chave the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause\u201d), overruled on other \ngrounds by S. Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080 \n(2018). More directly on point, it would offend the funda-\nmental principle that a statute \u201ccannot create personal ju-\nrisdiction where the Constitution forbids it.\u201d In re Terror-\nist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305 (2010); see \nPrice v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 \nF.3d 82, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that a stat-\nute cannot grant personal jurisdiction where the Constitu-\ntion forbids it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Or as \nthe Second Circuit put it in Waldman I (when rejecting \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the PLO and the PA had con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction through their appointment \nof an agent for service of process in Washington): A stat-\nute cannot itself \u201canswer the constitutional question of \nwhether due process is satisfied.\u201d 835 F.3d at 343 (empha-\nsis added). \nMoreover, as the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to the \njury trial right in College Savings Bank makes plain, to \naccept the argument advanced by Plaintiffs and the \nUnited States could (and likely would) have staggering \n\n117a \n \n \nimplications beyond the realm of personal jurisdiction. Af-\nter all, the concepts of consent and waiver have legal sig-\nnificance with respect to a host of individual constitutional \nrights. Law enforcement may conduct a warrantless \nsearch on consent. See, e.g., Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, \n412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973). A defendant cannot be prose-\ncuted for a felony absent an indictment unless he waives \nthe right to be indicted by a grant jury. See, e.g., Matthews \nv. United States, 622 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 2010). Parties \nentitled to a civil jury trial under the Seventh Amendment \ncan consent to a bench trial. See, e.g., Texas v. Penguin \nGrp. (USA) Inc., No. 11-MD-2293 (DLC), 2013 WL \n1759567, at *6-7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2013). Parties in a fed-\neral civil case are entitled to litigate their claims before an \nArticle III judicial officer absent consent to proceed by \nother means. See, e.g., Wellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sha-\nrif, 575 U.S. 665, 674-78 (2015). And so on. To accept that \nfair notice and an opportunity to alter conduct are all that \nis required for a legislature to \u201cdeem\u201d conduct to be \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d is to accept that the rights underlying these doc-\ntrines are subject to mere legislative whim. Congress \ncould simply say that a person who is arrested on probable \ncause with a cellphone is \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \u201cconsented\u201d to \na search of the phone, cf. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, \n386 (2014) (holding that law enforcement officers \u201cmust \ngenerally secure a warrant\u201d before searching a cellphone \nseized incident to an arrest); that by merely filing or an-\nswering a lawsuit in federal court, a party is \u201cdeemed\u201d to \nhave \u201cconsented\u201d to a bench trial or to have \u201cconsented\u201d to \nthe jurisdiction of a Magistrate Judge; and so on. Consti-\ntutional rights are not so fickle. \nConspicuously, Plaintiffs and the United States do not \ncite any case suggesting, let alone holding, that a legisla-\nture may simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct unrelated to actual con-\nsent to be consent, in the personal jurisdiction context or \n\n118a \n \n \notherwise.8 The closest they come is the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision in Bauxites, but Bauxites does not bear the \nweight they put on it. In Bauxites, the district court found \nthat the petitioners had violated various discovery orders \nrelating the question of personal jurisdiction. Exercising \nits authority under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the district court sanctioned the peti-\ntioners by deeming the facts that formed the basis for per-\nsonal jurisdiction to be established. On appeal, the peti-\ntioners argued that this violated due process because a \ncourt \u201cmay not create\u201d personal jurisdiction \u201cby judicial \nfiat.\u201d 456 U.S. at 695. The Supreme Court rejected the \nargument, holding that application of Rule 37(b)(2) sup-\nported the presumption, established in Hammond Pack-\ning Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909), \u201cthat the re-\nfusal to produce evidence material to the administration of \n \n8 Plaintiffs and the United States both rely on Wellness Interna-\ntional Network and Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580 (2003), see U.S. \nMem. 13-14; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 14, but neither case provides support for their \ncause. In each case, the Court blessed the concept of implied consent \n(in Wellness International Network, for consent to the jurisdiction of \na bankruptcy judge and in Roell, for consent to the jurisdiction of a \nmagistrate judge) and stressed that \u201cconsent \u2014 whether express or \nimplied \u2014 must still be knowing and voluntary.\u201d Wellness Int\u2019l Net-\nwork, 575 U.S. at 685. But neither case identified a standard for de-\ntermining what conduct constitutes implied consent, let alone ad-\ndressed whether or when a legislature can simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct to \nbe consent. If anything, the decisions support the proposition that \nconduct constitutes consent only where the party\u2019s actual acquies-\ncence can be inferred, as they held that a party\u2019s consent to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator turns on whether it \u201cvoluntarily appeared\u201d be-\nfore that adjudicator. Id. at 685; Roell, 538 U.S. at 590. \u201cAppearance\u201d \nis defined, in turn, as \u201cthe overt act by which a party submits himself \nto the court\u2019s jurisdiction. An appearance may be expressly made . . . \nor it may be implied from some act done with the intention of appear-\ning and submitting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 \nn.3 (emphases added). \n\n119a \n \n \ndue process was but an admission of the want of merit in \nthe asserted defense.\u201d 456 U.S. at 705-06. \u201cThe sanction,\u201d \nthe Court concluded, \u201ctook as established the facts \u2014 con-\ntacts with Pennsylvania \u2014 that [the respondent] was seek-\ning to establish through discovery. That a particular legal \nconsequence \u2014 personal jurisdiction of the court over the \ndefendants \u2014 follows from this, does not in any way affect \nthe appropriateness of the sanction.\u201d Id. at 709. \nBauxites, therefore, stands for the straightforward \nproposition that where a defendant voluntarily submits to \nthe jurisdiction of a court for purposes of disputing juris-\ndiction and then violates orders with respect to jurisdic-\ntional discovery, it does not offend due process to deem \nthe facts supporting personal jurisdiction to be estab-\nlished. Critically, however, the petitioners\u2019 conduct was \nrelated to the litigation itself \u2014 in which petitioners had \nvoluntarily appeared (albeit for the limited purpose of \ndisputing jurisdiction). See id. at 706 (\u201cA defendant is al-\nways free to ignore the judicial proceedings, risk a de-\nfault judgment, and then challenge that judgment on ju-\nrisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding. By sub-\nmitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the limited pur-\npose of challenging jurisdiction, the defendant agrees to \nabide by that court\u2019s determination on the issue of juris-\ndiction.\u201d (citation omitted)). Moreover, the petitioners \nwere not deemed to have consented to the court\u2019s juris-\ndiction through their conduct; indeed, the Court made \nclear that such a direct sanction would indeed have vio-\nlated due process. See 456 U.S. at 706 (citing Hovey v. El-\nliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897)). \nInstead, the petitioners\u2019 conduct in Bauxites was suffi-\ncient to support a presumption of fact \u2014 namely, that they \nhad contacts with Pennsylvania \u2014 that, in turn, had the \nlegal consequence of establishing personal jurisdiction. In \n\n120a \n \n \nother words, the Court blessed a legal fiction, but only be-\ncause the fiction was not so far detached from fact. See id. \nat 701 (quoting Justice Holmes\u2019s opinion in McDonald v. \nMabee, 243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917), for the proposition that \n\u201c\u2018great caution should be used not to let fiction deny the \nfair play that can be secured only by a pretty close adhe-\nsion to fact\u2019\u201d). Additionally, the Court took pains to state \nthat its holding \u201cdoes not alter the requirement that there \nbe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 between the nonresident defendant \nand the forum \nRather, our holding deals with how \nthe facts needed to show those \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 can be \nestablished when a defendant fails to comply with court-\nordered discovery.\u201d Id. at 703 n.10. If anything, therefore, \nBauxites supports the conclusion that a court may not ex-\nercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, based on \npurported consent or otherwise, unless the defendant has \nsufficient \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations\u201d with the forum \n\u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend tra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 319 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).9 \nSeparately, Plaintiffs and the United States fall back \non the deference that courts owe to the political branches \nwith respect to matters of foreign affairs and national se-\ncurity. See U.S. Mem. 10-13, 19; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 14-16. But \ntheir argument is unavailing for several reasons. First, \n \n9 To be sure, Bauxites does state that \u201c[t]he actions of the defendant \nmay amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court, \nwhether voluntary or not.\u201d 456 U.S. at 704-05 (emphasis added). Read \nin context, however, the phrase \u201cor not\u201d plainly refers to situations \nother than consent in which a defendant\u2019s actions nevertheless legally \namount to submission to the jurisdiction of a court. To read it other-\nwise would violate the fundamental proposition \u2014 endorsed, of course, \nby Plaintiffs and the United States themselves \u2014 that consent must \nbe knowing and voluntary in order to be valid. \n\n121a \n \n \nalthough courts should grant deference to the political \nbranches when it comes to such matters in light of their \nconstitutionally derived powers and expertise, \u201cconcerns \nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant \nabdication of the judicial role. . . . [T]he Government\u2019s au-\nthority and expertise in these matters do not automatically \ntrump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the protection \nthat the Constitution grants to individuals.\u201d Holder v. Hu-\nmanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 34 (2010) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see Open Soc\u2019y Just. Initiative v. \nDep\u2019t of Def., No. 20-CV-5096 (JMF), 2021 WL 3038528, at \n*7 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2021) (\u201cJudicial deference in the area \nof national security is certainly warranted. But deference \nis not equivalent to acquiescence.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). Indeed, the courts\u2019 \u201crespect for Con-\ngress\u2019s policy judgments\u201d cannot \u201cdisavow restraints on \nfederal power that the Constitution carefully constructed\u201d \nbecause courts \u201cenforce the limits on federal power by \nstriking down acts of Congress that transgress those lim-\nits.\u201d NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012). As Justice \nSouter once put it: \u201cEven Justice Sutherland\u2019s reading of \nthe National Government\u2019s \u2018inherent\u2019 foreign affairs \npower . . . contained the caveat that the power, \u2018like every \nother governmental power, must be exercised in subordi-\nnation to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d \nAm. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 417 n.9 (2003) \n(quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., \n299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). \nThe constitutional limits on the political branches\u2019 ex-\nercise of the treaty power underscore the point. The Con-\nstitution explicitly grants the President the \u201cPower, by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make \nTreaties.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2. And treaties, by defi-\nnition, implicate foreign relations. Yet, the law is pellucid \nthat \u201cthe treaty power cannot override constitutional \n\n122a \n \n \nlimitations respecting individual rights.\u201d Oneida Indian \nNation of N.Y. v. State of N.Y., 860 F.2d 1145, 1163 (2d Cir. \n1988) (citing Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1957) (plu-\nrality opinion)); see Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n, 539 U.S. at 416 & n.9 \n(\u201c[Treaties are s]ubject . . . to the Constitution\u2019s guaran-\ntees of individual rights.\u201d); In re Premises Located at 840 \n140th Ave. NE, Bellevue, Wash., 634 F.3d 557, 571 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201cTreaties, like statutes, are subject to constitu-\ntional limits, including the separation of powers and the \nguarantee of due process.\u201d). If the political branches can-\nnot use the treaty power \u2014 despite its explicit constitu-\ntional provenance and the fact that it is wielded, by defini-\ntion, in the realm of foreign affairs \u2014 to override an indi-\nvidual\u2019s due process rights, they surely cannot do so here \neither. \nSecond, and in any event, Plaintiffs and the United \nStates do not cite, and the Court has not found, any au-\nthority for the proposition that the test for personal juris-\ndiction \u2014 which, again, is an individual constitutional right \n\u2014 varies by context or by the nature of a plaintiff\u2019s claim. \nSee Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56 (\u201c[A]lthough congressional in-\nterests may be relevant to whether personal jurisdiction \ncomports with due-process standards, they cannot change \nthe standards themselves.\u201d (citation omitted)); see also \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 329-30 & n.10 (holding that per-\nsonal jurisdiction standards are the same under the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments, citing cases against foreign \ndefendants and involving terrorism, and specifically re-\njecting the argument that there is \u201c\u2018universal\u2019 \u2014 or limit-\nless \u2014 personal jurisdiction in terrorism cases\u201d). And fi-\nnally, such an \u201cexpansive view\u201d of Congress\u2019s authority to \ncreate personal jurisdiction where it otherwise would not \nexist, even if limited to the context of foreign affairs, would \npay insufficient \u201cheed to the risks to international comity.\u201d \nDaimler, 571 U.S. at 141. \u201cConsiderations of international \n\n123a \n \n \nrapport thus reinforce\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that \nsubjecting\u201d foreign parties to jurisdiction based on con-\nduct that has no direct contact with the United States, let \nalone nexus with litigation in the United States, \u201cwould not \naccord with the \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 due pro-\ncess demands.\u201d Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316). \nIn the final analysis, the Court cannot acquiesce in \nCongress\u2019s legislative sleight of hand and exercise juris-\ndiction over Defendants here pursuant to the PSVJTA. A \ndefendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent is a valid basis \nto subject it to the jurisdiction of a court, but Congress \ncannot simply declare anything it wants to be consent. To \nhold otherwise would let fiction get the better of fact and \nmake a mockery of the Due Process Clause. See McDon-\nald, 243 U.S. at 91 (Holmes, J.) (\u201c[G]reat caution should be \nused not to let fiction deny the fair play that can be secured \nonly by a pretty close adhesion to fact\u201d); M3 USA Corp. v. \nQamoum, No. CV 20-2903 (RDM), 2021 WL 2324753, at \n*12 (D.D.C. June 7, 2021) (\u201c[T]he Court must avoid treat-\ning \u2018consent\u2019 as simply a \u2018legal fiction\u2019 devoid of content or \nengaging in \u2018circular\u2019 reasoning that premises \u2018consent\u2019 on \nthe presumption that defendants know the law and then \ndefines the law so that anyone engaging in the defined con-\nduct is deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d). That is not to say that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdic-\ntion in all its forms would necessarily be unconstitutional.10 \n \n10 Nor is it to say that Defendants are correct in arguing that \n\u201c\u2018deemed\u2019 consent to jurisdiction cannot be squared with Due Process \nunless there is reciprocity,\u201d which they define as \u201can express or im-\nplied exchange by which a defendant impliedly agrees to jurisdiction \nin return for a benefit conferred by the forum,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. 1 (empha-\nsis added). Although there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s re-\nceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent, see, e.g., Hess v. Paw-\nloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356-57 (1927); cf. J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at \n881 (plurality opinion) (describing \u201ccircumstances, or a course of \n\n124a \n \n \nIf the underlying conduct were a closer proxy for actual \nconsent, perhaps a statute deeming the conduct to be con-\nsent would pass muster. The Court leaves that question \nfor another day. For today\u2019s purposes, it suffices to say \nthat the provisions of the PSVJTA at issue push the con-\ncept of consent well beyond its breaking point and that the \npredicate conduct alleged here is not \u201cof such a nature as \nto justify the fiction\u201d of consent. Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318. \nIt follows that exercising jurisdiction under the facts of \nthis case does not comport with due process and Defend-\nants\u2019 motion must be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nAs in Waldman I, the killing of Ari Fuld was \u201cunques-\ntionably horrific\u201d and Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to seek justice on \nhis and their own behalf are morally compelling. 835 F.3d \nat 344. \u201cBut,\u201d as the Second Circuit emphasized in its de-\ncision, \u201cthe federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a \ncivil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process \nclause of the Constitution, no matter how horrendous the \nunderlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims.\u201d Id. at 344. For the reasons discussed above, the \nCourt concludes that exercising jurisdiction here would in-\ndeed go beyond the limits prescribed by the Due Process \nClause. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, \n \nconduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from \nand thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State\u201d); Coll. \nSavings Bank, 527 U.S. at 686 (\u201cCongress may, in the exercise of its \nspending power, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their \ntaking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take, \nand that acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the ac-\ntions.\u201d), Defendants do not cite, and the Court has not found, any case \nholding that such receipt of a benefit is a necessary condition. See \nalso, e.g., Sun Forest Corp. v. Shvili, 152 F. Supp. 2d 367, 380 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (Lynch, J.) (\u201c[V]oluntary consent to jurisdiction need \nnot be supported by consideration.\u201d). \n\n125a \n \n \nthe Court concludes that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for \nlack of personal jurisdiction must be and is GRANTED. \nAs a result, the Court need not and does not reach Defend-\nants\u2019 other arguments for dismissal. \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. \n24, to close this case, and to enter judgment for Defend-\nants. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  January 6, 2022 \n \nNew York, New York \n \nJESSE M.

The plaintiffs contend that the newly enacted \nATCA provides federal courts with jurisdiction over the \ndefendants in this case and thus the mandate should be \nrecalled. The extraordinary remedy of recalling a mandate \nis not warranted in this case, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion is \naccordingly DENIED. \n \nKENT A. YALOWITZ AND DAVID C.

Koeltl, of the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York, sitting by designation. \n\n130a \n \n \nattacks in Israel that killed or wounded the plaintiffs or \ntheir family members. After a seven-week trial, the jury \nawarded the plaintiffs damages which, after trebling, \namounted to $655.5 million. On appeal, this Court held that \nthe federal courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This Court \nvacated the judgment of the district court and remanded \nthe case with instructions to dismiss the action. The man-\ndate issued on November 28, 2016, and the Supreme Court \ndenied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari on \nApril 2, 2018. The plaintiffs have now moved to recall the \nmandate based on the recently enacted Anti-Terrorism \nClarification Act (\u201cATCA\u201d). \nThe ATCA became law on October 3, 2018. Pub. L. \nNo. 115-253, 132 Stat 3183 (2018). Section 4 of the ATCA, \nwhich added a subsection (e) to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334, specifies \nactivities by which certain parties shall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction. The provision states \nthat \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of the act of \ninternational terrorism upon which [a] civil action \n[brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333] was filed,\u201d a defendant \nshall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin such action if the defendant either (a) accepts any of \nthree specified forms of assistance after the date that is \n120 days after Section 4 of the ATCA was enacted or (b) is \n\u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension of section 1003 of \nthe [ATA]\u201d and, after the date that is 120 days after Sec-\ntion 4 of the ATCA was enacted, establishes or continues \nto maintain \u201cany office, headquarters, premises, or other \nfacilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States.\u201d1 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \n \n1 Section 1003 of the ATA provides that: \nIt shall be unlawful, if the purpose be to further the interests of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor to any of those, or any agents thereof . . . \n\n131a \n \n \nOn October 8, 2018, the plaintiffs filed the present mo-\ntion to recall the mandate issued in this case. They argue \nthat Section 4 of the ATCA provides the federal courts \nwith jurisdiction over the defendants with respect to the \nplaintiffs\u2019 claims. The defendants counter that the plain-\ntiffs have failed to show circumstances that warrant the \nextraordinary remedy of recalling the mandate and that, \nin any event, Section 4 of the ATCA does not apply retro-\nactively to closed cases. \nI. \nThe federal courts of appeals \u201cpossess an inherent \npower to recall [a] mandate, subject to review for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d Taylor v. United States, 822 F.3d 84, 90 (2d \n \n(1) to receive anything of value except informational material \nfrom the PLO or any of its constituent groups, any successor \nthereto, or any agents thereof; \n(2) to expend funds from the PLO or any of its constituent \ngroups, any successor thereto, or any agents thereof; or \n(3) notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, to es-\ntablish or maintain an office, headquarters, premises, or other fa-\ncilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the United \nStates at the behest or direction of, or with funds provided by the \nPalestine Liberation Organization or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor to any of those, or any agents thereof. \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202. The President of the United States may waive this \nprovision  \nif the President determines and certifies in writing to the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Sen-\nate, and the appropriate congressional committees that the Palestin-\nians have not, after the date of enactment of this Act [either (1) taken \ncertain steps at the U.N. or (2) taken certain actions vis-\u00e0-vis the \nInternational Criminal Court]. \nKlieman v. Palestinian Auth., --- F.3d ----, 2019 WL 2093018, at *12 \n(D.C. Cir. May 14, 2019) (alteration and emphasis in Klieman) (quot-\ning Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113, 129 \nStat. 2242, 2780 (2015)). \n\n132a \n \n \nCir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted, alteration in origi-\nnal). Recalling a mandate is an extraordinary remedy to \nbe used \u201csparing[ly].\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. \n538, 550 (1998); Taylor, 822 F.3d at 90. Courts are reluc-\ntant to recall a mandate because of \u201cthe need to preserve \nfinality in judicial proceedings.\u201d Sargent v. Columbia For-\nest Prod., Inc., 75 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1996). Although the \npassage of a new law might warrant recalling a mandate \nin some circumstances, this is not such a case. \nII. \nA. \nThe plaintiffs have not shown that either factual pred-\nicate of Section 4 of the ATCA has been satisfied. As to the \nfirst factual predicate, acceptance of a qualifying form of \nUnited States assistance, the plaintiffs state only that the \ndefendants have accepted qualifying assistance in the \npast; they do not contend that the defendants currently do \nso. Meanwhile, in Klieman v. Palestinian  Authority, \nwhich was decided on May 14, 2019, the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit accepted the represen-\ntation the Department of Justice made in an amicus curiae \nbrief that neither the PLO nor the PA accept United \nStates assistance. --- F.3d ----, 2019 WL 2093018, at *10 \n(D.C. Cir. May 14, 2019). The papers the plaintiffs filed in \nconnection with this motion do not provide any reason to \ndoubt the Department of Justice\u2019s representation or the \nKlieman court\u2019s adoption of that representation. \nThe plaintiffs also fail to show that, in accordance with \nSection 4\u2019s second factual predicate, the defendants bene-\nfit from a waiver or suspension of Section 1003 of the ATA \nand have established or continued to maintain an office or \nother facility \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \nBoth conditions are necessary under Section 4\u2019s second \nfactual predicate. Klieman, 2019 WL 2093018 at *10. \n\n133a \n \n \nAs to the first condition, the plaintiffs have not estab-\nlished that the defendants benefit from an express waiver \nor suspension under Section 1003 of the ATA. The plain-\ntiffs contend that an express waiver is not required by Sec-\ntion 4 of the ATCA, and that the President impliedly sus-\npended Section 1003 of the ATA with respect to the de-\nfendants by permitting the defendants to engage in con-\nduct allowed only if Section 1003 were suspended. But the \nKlieman court persuasively rejected a similar argument, \nreasoning that allowing implied waivers to qualify under \nSection 4 of the ATCA would \u201cneglect the actual language \nof the legal authorization to issue waivers under [ATA] \n\u00a7 1003, . . . which creates legal consequences when the \nPresident \u2018certifies in writing\u2019 that a waiver is to be is-\nsued.\u201d 2019 WL 2093018 at *12. The plaintiffs in this case \nhave not put forth anything that could qualify as, or sub-\nstitute for, an express waiver or suspension under Section \n1003 of the ATA. \nMoreover, the plaintiffs in this case have not shown \nthat the defendants have established or continued to main-\ntain an office or other facility within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States. Although the PLO maintains its United \nNations Observer Mission in New York, the prohibitions \nof Section 1003 of the ATA do not apply to that office. \nKlinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione \nMotonave Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, 46 (2d Cir. 1991); \nsee United States v.  Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. \nSupp. 1456, 1465 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (finding the ATA inap-\nplicable to the PLO Observer Mission). The Observer Mis-\nsion is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States. See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51 (\u201c[T]he \nPLO\u2019s participation in the UN is dependent on the legal \nfiction that the UN Headquarters is not really United \nStates territory at all, but is rather neutral ground over \nwhich the United States has ceded control.\u201d). \n\n134a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs point out that, according to Klinghoffer, \n\u201cactivities not conducted in furtherance of the PLO\u2019s ob-\nserver status may properly be considered as a basis of ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d Id. at 51. But this statement was made in ref-\nerence to determining whether such activities conferred \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO under \u00a7 301 of the New \nYork Civil Practice Laws and Rules. Nothing in Kling-\nhoffer suggests that the PLO\u2019s engaging in activities un-\nrelated to its observer status transforms the PLO\u2019s Ob-\nserver Mission into an office or other facility for the PLO \n\u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \nIn sum, the plaintiffs have provided no basis to con-\nclude that a factual predicate of Section 4 of the ATCA has \nbeen met in this case. \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s interest in finality also weighs against re-\ncalling the mandate. When its factual predicates are met, \nSection 4 provides jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cregard-\nless of the date of the occurrence of the act of international \nterrorism upon which [the relevant] civil action was filed,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1), providing that the defendant sub-\nsequently commits certain acts. But irrespective of \nwhether this language suggests that Section 4 applies ret-\nroactively to pending cases, such as the appeal in Klieman, \nit does not suggest that courts should reopen cases that \nare no longer pending. Legislation applies prospectively \nunless Congress explicitly provides for retroactive appli-\ncation. Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257, 265\u201366 (2012); see \nLandgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 272\u201373 (1994). \nAnd it is well-established that retroactive laws generally \ndo not affect valid, final judgments. See Bank Markazi v. \nPeterson, 136 S. Ct. 1310, 1323 (2016) (\u201cCongress . . . may \nnot \u2018retroactively comman[d] the federal courts to reopen \nfinal judgments.\u2019\u201d (quoting Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, \nInc., 514 U.S. 211, 219 (1995) (alteration in original))). The \n\n135a \n \n \nmandate in this case was issued two and a half years ago, \nand the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a \nwrit of certiorari more than six months before the plain-\ntiffs filed their motion to recall the mandate. The ATCA \ndoes not provide explicitly or implicitly that closed cases \ncan be reopened. Recalling the mandate now would offend \n\u201cthe need to preserve finality in judicial proceedings.\u201d \nTaylor, 822 F.3d at 90 (quotation marks omitted).2  \nCONCLUSION \nThis case does not warrant invoking the extraordi-\nnary remedy of recalling a mandate issued two and a half \nyears ago. The Court has considered all the arguments of \nthe parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, they \nare either moot or without merit. For the reasons ex-\nplained above, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate \nis DENIED. \n \n \n \n2 The plaintiffs in this case have filed a new complaint in the South-\nern District of New York. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, No. 18cv12213 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent that there are any de-\nvelopments in the activities of the PA or the PLO that may subject \nthem to personal jurisdiction under the ATCA, they can be raised in \nthat case. \n\n \n \n(136a) \nAPPENDIX G \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n \nCase Argued: April 12, 2016  \nCase Decided: August 31, 2016 \nMotion Filed: October 8, 2018 \nMotion Decided: June 3, 2019 \nDocket Nos. 15-3135-cv (Lead); 15-3151-cv (XAP) \nEVA WALDMAN, REVITAL BAUER, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS \nNATURAL GUARDIAN OF PLAINTIFFS YEHONATHON \nBAUER, BINYAMIN BAUER, DANIEL BAUER AND YEHUDA \nBAUER, SHAUL MANDELKORN, NURIT MANDELKORN, OZ \nJOSEPH GUETTA, MINOR, BY HIS NEXT FRIEND AND \nGUARDIAN VARDA GUETTA, VARDA GUETTA, \nINDIVIDUALLY AND AS NATURAL GUARDIAN OF PLAINTIFF \nOZ JOSEPH GUETTA, NORMAN GRITZ, INDIVIDUALLY AND \nAS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF \nDAVID GRITZ, MARK I.

A jury found the defendants---the Palestine \nLiberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority---\nliable under the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a), for various terror attacks in Israel that killed or \nwounded United States citizens.  The jury awarded the \nplaintiffs damages of $218.5 million, an amount that was \ntrebled automatically pursuant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total award to $655.5 million.  The \ndefendants appeal, arguing that the district court lacked \ngeneral and specific personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants, and, in the alternative, seek a new trial because the \ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing certain tes-\ntimony by two expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs cross-ap-\npeal, asking this Court to reinstate claims the district \ncourt dismissed. \nWe vacate the judgment of the district court and re-\nmand the case with instructions to dismiss the action be-\ncause the federal courts lack personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendants with respect to the claims in this action.

Koeltl, District Judge: \nIn this case, eleven American families sued the Pales-\ntine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian \nAuthority (\u201cPA\u201d) (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d)1 under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), for var-\nious terror attacks in Israel that killed or wounded the \nplaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) or their \nfamily members.2  \nThe defendants repeatedly argued before the District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York that the court \nlacked personal jurisdiction over them in light of their \nminimal presence in, and the lack of any nexus between \nthe facts underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the United \nStates.  The district court (Daniels, J.) concluded that it \n \n1  While other defendants, such as Yasser Arafat, were named as de-\nfendants in the case, they did not appear, and the Judgment was en-\ntered only against the PLO and the PA. \n2  The plaintiffs are United States citizens, and the guardians, family \nmembers, and personal representatives of the estates of United States \ncitizens, who were killed or injured in the terrorist attacks. \n\n141a \n \n \nhad general personal jurisdiction over the defendants, \neven after the Supreme Court narrowed the test for gen-\neral jurisdiction in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 \n(2014).  See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 04-\ncv-397 (GBD), 2014 WL 6811395, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, \n2014); see also Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. \n04-cv-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. \n30, 2011). \nAfter a seven-week trial, a jury found that the defend-\nants, acting through their employees, perpetrated the at-\ntacks and that the defendants knowingly provided mate-\nrial support to organizations designated by the United \nStates State Department as foreign terrorist organiza-\ntions.  The jury awarded the plaintiffs damages of $218.5 \nmillion, an amount that was trebled automatically pursu-\nant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total \naward to $655.5 million. \nOn appeal, the defendants seek to overturn the jury\u2019s \nverdict by arguing that the United States Constitution \nprecludes the exercise of personal jurisdiction over them.  \nIn the alternative, the defendants seek a new trial, arguing \nthat the district court abused its discretion by allowing \ncertain testimony by two expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs \ncross-appeal, asking this Court to reinstate non-federal \nclaims that the district court dismissed, and reinstate the \nclaims of two plaintiffs for which the district court found \ninsufficient evidence to submit to the jury. \nWe conclude that the district court erred when it con-\ncluded it had personal jurisdiction over the defendants \nwith respect to the claims at issue in this action.  There-\nfore, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and \nREMAND the case to the district court with instructions \nto DISMISS the case for want of personal jurisdiction.  Ac-\ncordingly, we do not consider the defendants\u2019 other \n\n142a \n \n \narguments on appeal or the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, all of \nwhich are now moot. \nI. \nA. \nThe PA was established by the 1993 Oslo Accords as \nthe interim and non-sovereign government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d).  The PA is headquartered in the city \nof Ramallah in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Pres-\nident and the PA\u2019s ministers reside. \nThe PLO was founded in 1964.  At all relevant times, \nthe PLO was headquartered in Ramallah, the Gaza Strip, \nand Amman, Jordan.  Because the Oslo Accords limit the \nPA\u2019s authority to Palestine, the PLO conducts Palestine\u2019s \nforeign affairs. \nDuring the relevant time period for this action, the \nPLO maintained over 75 embassies, missions, and delega-\ntions around the world.  The PLO is registered with the \nUnited States Government as a foreign agent.  The PLO \nhas two diplomatic offices in the United States: a mission \nto the United States in Washington, D.C. and a mission to \nthe United Nations in New York City.  The Washington, \nD.C. mission had fourteen employees between 2002 and \n2004, including two employees of the PA, although not all \nat the same time.3  The Washington, D.C. and New York \nmissions engaged in diplomatic activities during the rele-\nvant period.  The Washington, D.C. mission \u201chad a sub-\nstantial commercial presence in the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *4.  It used dozens of tele-\nphone numbers, purchased office supplies, paid for certain \nliving expenses for Hassan Abdel Rahman, the chief PLO \n \n3  The district court concluded that \u201cthe weight of the evidence indi-\ncates that the D.C. office simultaneously served as an office for the \nPLO and the PA.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *3. \n\n143a \n \n \nand PA representative in the United States, and engaged \nin other transactions.  Id.  The PLO also retained a con-\nsulting and lobbying firm through a multi-year, multi-mil-\nlion-dollar contract for services from about 1999 to 2004.  \nId.  The Washington, D.C. mission also promoted the Pal-\nestinian cause in speeches and media appearances. Id.   \nCourts have repeatedly held that neither the PA nor \nthe PLO is a \u201cstate\u201d under United States or international \nlaw.  See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, \n47-48 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding the PLO, which had no de-\nfined territory or permanent population and did not have \ncapacity to enter into genuine formal relations with other \nnations, was not a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of the Foreign Sov-\nereign Immunities Act); Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian \nAuth., 315 F. Supp. 2d 164, 178-86 (D.R.I. 2004) (holding \nthat neither the PA nor the PLO is a state entitled to sov-\nereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct because neither entity has a defined territory with a \npermanent population controlled by a government that \nhas the capacity to enter into foreign relations); see also \nKnox v.  Palestine Liberation Org., 306 F. Supp. 2d 424, \n431 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (holding that neither the PLO nor the \nPA was a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act). \nWhile the United States does not recognize Palestine \nor the PA as a sovereign government, see Sokolow v. Pal-\nestine  Liberation Org., 583 F. Supp. 2d 451, 457-58 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\u201cPalestine, whose statehood is not recog-\nnized by the United States, does not meet the definition of \na \u2018state,\u2019 under United States and international law . . . .\u201d) \n(collecting cases), the PA is the governing authority in Pal-\nestine and employs tens of thousands of security personnel \nin Palestine.  According to the PA\u2019s Minister of Finance, \nthe \u201cPA funds conventional government services, includ-\ning developing infrastructure; public safety and the judi-\ncial system; health care; public schools and education; \n\n144a \n \n \nforeign affairs; economic development initiatives in agri-\nculture, energy, public works, and public housing; the pay-\nment of more than 155,000 government employee salaries \nand related pension funds; transportation; and, communi-\ncations and information technology services.\u201d \nB. \nThe plaintiffs sued the defendants in 2004, alleging vi-\nolations of the ATA for seven terror attacks committed \nduring a wave of violence known as \u201cthe al Aqsa Intifada,\u201d \nby nonparties who the plaintiffs alleged were affiliated \nwith the defendants.  The jury found the plaintiffs liable \nfor six of the attacks.4 At trial, the plaintiffs presented ev-\nidence of the following attacks. \ni. January 22, 2002: Jaffa Road Shooting \nOn January 22, 2002, a PA police officer opened fire \non a pedestrian mall in Jerusalem.  He shot \u201cindiscrimi-\nnately at the people who were on Jaffa Street,\u201d at a nearby \nbus stop and aboard a bus that was at the stop, and at peo-\nple in the stores nearby \u201cwith the aim of causing the death \nof as many people as possible.\u201d  The shooter killed two in-\ndividuals and wounded forty-five others before he was \nkilled by police.  The attack was carried out, according to \ntrial evidence, by six members of the PA police force who \nplanned the shooting.  Two of the plaintiffs were injured. \nii. January 27, 2002: Jaffa Road Bombing \nOn January 27, 2002, a PA intelligence informant \nnamed Wafa Idris detonated a suicide bomb on Jaffa Road \nin Jerusalem, killing herself and an Israeli man and \n \n4  The district court found claims relating to an attack on January 8, \n2001 that wounded Oz Guetta speculative and did not allow those \nclaims to proceed to the jury. The plaintiffs argue that this Court \nshould reinstate the Guetta claims. Because we conclude that there is \nno personal jurisdiction over the defendants for the ATA claims, it is \nunnecessary to reach this issue. \n\n145a \n \n \nseriously wounding four of the plaintiffs, including two \nchildren.  Evidence presented at trial showed that the \nbombing was planned by a PA intelligence officer who en-\ncouraged the assailant to conduct the suicide bombing, \neven after the assailant had doubts about doing so. \niii. March 21, 2002: King George Street Bombing \nOn March 21, 2002, Mohammed Hashaika, a former \nPA police officer, detonated a suicide bomb on King \nGeorge Street in Jerusalem.  Hashaika\u2019s co-conspirators \nchose the location because it was \u201cfull of people during the \nafternoon.\u201d  Hashaika set-off the explosion while in a \ncrowd \u201cwith the aim of causing the deaths of as many civil-\nians as possible.\u201d  Two plaintiffs were grievously wounded, \nincluding a seven-year-old American boy.  Evidence pre-\nsented at trial showed that a PA intelligence officer named \nAbdel Karim Aweis orchestrated the attack. \niv. June 19, 2002: French Hill Bombing \nOn June 19, 2002, a seventeen-year-old Palestinian \nman named Sa\u2019id Awada detonated a suicide bomb at a bus \nstop in the French Hill neighborhood of Jerusalem.  \nAwada was a member of a militant faction of the PLO\u2019s \nFatah party called the Al Aqsa Martyr Brigades \n(\u201cAAMB\u201d), which the United States Department of State \nhad designated as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d \n(\u201cFTO\u201d).  The bombing killed several people and wounded \ndozens, including an eighteen-year-old plaintiff who was \nstepping off a bus when the bomb exploded. \nv. July 31, 2002: Hebrew University Bombing \nOn July 31, 2002, military operatives of Hamas---a \nUnited States-designated FTO---detonated a bomb hid-\nden in a black cloth bag that was packed with hardware \nnuts in a caf\u00e9 at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  The ex-\nplosion killed nine, including four United States citizens, \nwhose estates bring suit here.  \n\n146a \n \n \nvi. January 29, 2004: Bus No. 19 Bombing \nOn January 29, 2004, in an AAMB attack, a PA police \nofficer named Ali Al-Ja\u2019ara detonated a suicide vest on a \ncrowded bus, Bus No. 19 traveling from Malha Mall to-\nward Paris Square in central Jerusalem.  The suicide \nbombing killed eleven people, including one of the plain-\ntiffs.  The bomber\u2019s aim, according to evidence submitted \nat trial, was to \u201ccaus[e] the deaths of a large number of \nindividuals.\u201d \nC. \nIn 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of New York.  The defendants first moved to dismiss \nthe claims for lack of personal jurisdiction in July 2007.  \nThe district court denied the motion, subject to renewal \nafter jurisdictional discovery.  After the close of jurisdic-\ntional discovery, the district court denied the defendants\u2019 \nrenewed motion, holding that the court had general per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendants.  See Sokolow, 2011 \nWL 1345086, at *7. \nThe district court concluded, as an initial matter, that \nthe service of process was properly effected by serving the \nChief Representative of the PLO and the PA, Hassan Ab-\ndel Rahman, at his home in Virginia, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 4(h)(1)(B) (providing that a for-\neign association \u201cmust be served[ ] . . . in a judicial district \nof the United States . . . by delivering a copy of the sum-\nmons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or \ngeneral agent . . . .\u201d); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a) (provid-\ning for nationwide service of process and venue under the \nATA); Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2. \nThe district court then engaged in a two-part analysis \nto determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \ncomported with the due process protections of the United \nStates Constitution.  First, it determined whether the de-\nfendants had sufficient minimum contacts with the forum \n\n147a \n \n \nsuch that the maintenance of the action did not offend tra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2 (citing Frontera Res. \nAzerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan Republic, \n582 F.3d 393, 396 (2d Cir. 2009)). \nThe district court distinguished between specific and \ngeneral personal jurisdiction---specific jurisdiction applies \nwhere the defendants\u2019 contacts are related to the litigation \nand general jurisdiction applies where the defendants\u2019 \ncontacts are so substantial that the defendants could be \nsued on all claims, even those unrelated to contacts with \nthe forum---and found that the district court had general \njurisdiction over the defendants.  Id. at *3.  The court con-\nsidered what it deemed the defendants\u2019 \u201csubstantial com-\nmercial presence in the United States,\u201d in particular \u201ca \nfully and continuously functional office in Washington, \nD.C.,\u201d bank accounts and commercial contracts, and \u201ca \nsubstantial promotional presence in the United States, \nwith the D.C. office having been permanently dedicated to \npromoting the interests of the PLO and the PA.\u201d  Id. at *4. \nThe district court concluded that activities involving \nthe defendants\u2019 New York office were exempt from juris-\ndictional analysis under an exception for United Nations\u2019 \nrelated activity articulated in Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51-\n52 (UN participation not properly considered basis for ju-\nrisdiction); see Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *5.  The dis-\ntrict court held that the activities involving the Washing-\nton, D.C. mission were not exempt from analysis and pro-\nvided \u201ca sufficient basis to exercise general jurisdiction \nover the Defendants.\u201d  Id. at *6 (\u201cThe PLO and the PA \nwere continuously and systematically present in the \nUnited States by virtue of their extensive public relations \nactivities.\u201d). \nNext, the district court considered \u201c\u2018whether the as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction comports with \u201ctraditional \n\n148a \n \n \nnotions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d---that is, \nwhether it is reasonable under the circumstances of the \nparticular case.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Rob-\nertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 568 (2d Cir. 1996)).  The \ncourt found that the exercise of jurisdiction did not offend \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\u201d \npursuant to the standard articulated by International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945), and its \nprogeny.  See Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *6-7.  The dis-\ntrict court concluded that \u201c[t]here is a strong inherent in-\nterest of the United States and Plaintiffs in litigating ATA \nclaims in the United States,\u201d and that the defendants \n\u201cfailed to identify an alternative forum where Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims could be brought, and where the foreign court could \ngrant a substantially similar remedy.\u201d  Id. at *7. \nIn January 2014, after the Supreme Court had signif-\nicantly narrowed the general personal jurisdiction test in \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. 746, the defendants moved for recon-\nsideration of the denial of their motion to dismiss. \nOn April 11, 2014, the district court denied the defend-\nants\u2019 motions for reconsideration, ruling that Daimler did \nnot compel dismissal.  The district court also denied the \ndefendants\u2019 motions to certify the jurisdictional issue for \nan interlocutory appeal.  See Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, \nat *1.  The defendants renewed their jurisdictional argu-\nment in their motions for summary judgment, arguing \nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Gucci America, Inc. v. Weix-\ning Li, 768 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2014), altered the controlling \nprecedent in this Circuit, requiring dismissal of the case.  \nSee Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *1.  The district court \nconcluded that it still had general personal jurisdiction \nover the defendants, describing the action as presenting \n\u201c\u2018an exceptional case,\u2019\u201d id. at *2, of the kind discussed in \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19, and Gucci, 768 F.3d at 135. \n\n149a \n \n \nThe district court held that \u201c[u]nder both Daimler \nand Gucci, the PA and PLO\u2019s continuous and systematic \nbusiness and commercial contacts within the United \nStates are sufficient to support the exercise of general ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d and that the record before the court was \u201cin-\nsufficient to conclude that either defendant is \u2018at home\u2019 in \na particular jurisdiction other than the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *2. \nFollowing the summary judgment ruling, the defend-\nants sought mandamus on the personal jurisdiction issue.  \nThis Court denied the defendants\u2019 petition.  See In re Pal-\nestine Liberation Org., Palestinian Authority, No. 14-\n4449 (2d Cir. Jan. 6, 2015) (summary order). \nThe case proceeded to trial in January 2015.  During \nthe trial, the defendants introduced evidence about the \nPA\u2019s and PLO\u2019s home in Palestine.  The trial evidence \nshowed that the terrorist attacks occurred in the vicinity \nof Jerusalem.  The plaintiffs did not allege or submit evi-\ndence that the plaintiffs were targeted in any of the six at-\ntacks at issue because of their United States citizenship or \nthat the defendants engaged in conduct in the United \nStates related to the attacks. \nAt the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case in chief, the de-\nfendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), arguing, among \nother grounds, that the district court lacked personal ju-\nrisdiction over the defendants.  The Court denied the mo-\ntion.  The defendants renewed that motion at the close of \nall the evidence and again asserted that the court lacked \npersonal jurisdiction. \nDuring and immediately after trial, the District Court \nfor the District of Columbia issued three separate deci-\nsions dismissing similar suits for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion by similar plaintiffs in cases against the PA and the \nPLO.  See Estate of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 82 F. \n\n150a \n \n \nSupp. 3d 237, 245\u00ac46 (D.D.C. 2015), appeal docketed, No. \n15-7034 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 8, 2015); Livnat v. Palestinian \nAuth., 82 F. Supp. 3d 19, 30 (D.D.C. 2015), appeal dock-\neted, No. 15-7024 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2015); Safra v. Pales-\ntinian Auth., 82 F. Supp. 3d 37, 47-48 (D.D.C. 2015), ap-\npeal docketed, No. 15-7025 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2015). \nIn light of these cases, on May 1, 2015, the defendants \nrenewed their motion to dismiss for lack of both general \nand specific personal jurisdiction.  The defendants also \nmoved, in the alternative, for judgment as a matter of law \nor for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure 50(b) and 59.  The district court reviewed the deci-\nsions by the District Court for the District of Columbia, \nbut, for the reasons articulated in its 2014 decision and at \noral argument, concluded that the district court had gen-\neral personal jurisdiction over the defendants.  The dis-\ntrict court did not rule explicitly on whether it had specific \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants. \nThe jury found the defendants liable for all six attacks \nand awarded the plaintiffs damages of $218.5 million, an \namount that was trebled automatically pursuant to the \nATA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total award to \n$655.5 million. \nThe parties engaged in post-trial motion practice not \nrelevant here, the defendants timely appealed, and the \nplaintiffs cross-appealed. \nII. \nA. \n\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s assertion of personal ju-\nrisdiction de novo.\u201d  Dynegy Midstream Servs. v. Tram-\nmochem, 451 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2006).5  \n \n5  The standard of review in this case is complicated because the is-\nsue of personal jurisdiction was raised initially on a motion to dismiss, \nboth before and after discovery, and as a basis for Rule 50 motions at \n\n151a \n \n \nTo exercise personal jurisdiction lawfully, three re-\nquirements must be met.  \u201cFirst, the plaintiff\u2019s service of \nprocess upon the defendant must have been procedurally \nproper.  Second, there must be a statutory basis for per-\nsonal jurisdiction that renders such service of process ef-\nfective. . . .  Third, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nmust comport with constitutional due process principles.\u201d  \nLicci  ex rel. Licci v.

Personal \njurisdiction is \u201ca matter of individual liberty\u201d because due \nprocess protects the individual\u2019s right to be subject only to \nlawful power.  J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion) (quoting Ins. Corp. \nof Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n702 (1982)). \nThe ATA provides that process \u201cmay be served in any \ndistrict where the defendant resides, is found, or has an \n \nthe conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case and after all the evidence was pre-\nsented. This Court typically reviews factual findings in a district \ncourt\u2019s decision on personal jurisdiction for clear error and its legal \nconclusions de novo. See Frontera Res., 582 F.3d at 395. In this case, \nthe parties agree that this Court should review de novo whether the \ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction was constitutional. See \nPls.\u2019 Br. at 27; Defs.\u2019 Br. at 23. In any event, the issues relating to \ngeneral jurisdiction are essentially legal questions that should be re-\nviewed de novo. Assuming without deciding the question, we review \nthe district court\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction de novo. \n\n152a \n \n \nagent . . . . \u201d 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2334(a).  The district court found \nthat the plaintiffs properly served the defendants because \nthey served the complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 4(h)(1)(B) (providing that service on an \nunincorporated association is proper if the complaint is \nserved on a \u201cgeneral agent\u201d of the entity), on Hassan Ab-\ndel Rahman, who \u201cbased upon the overwhelming compe-\ntent evidence produced by Plaintiffs, was the Chief Rep-\nresentative of the PLO and the PA in the United States at \nthe time of service.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2.6 \nThe defendants have not disputed that service was \nproper and that there was a statutory basis pursuant to \nthe ATA for that service of process.  Therefore, the only \nquestion before the Court is whether the third jurisdic-\ntional requirement is met---whether jurisdiction over the \ndefendants may be exercised consistent with the Consti-\ntution. \nB. \nBefore we reach the analysis of constitutional due pro-\ncess, the plaintiffs raise three threshold issues: First, \nwhether the defendants waived their objections to per-\nsonal jurisdiction; second, whether the defendants have \ndue process rights at all; and third, whether the due pro-\ncess clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution \nand not the Fourteenth Amendment controls the personal \njurisdiction analysis in this case. \nFirst, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants waived \ntheir argument that the district court lacked personal ju-\nrisdiction over them.  The plaintiffs contend that the de-\nfendants could have argued that they were not subject to \ngeneral jurisdiction under the \u201cat home\u201d test before \n \n6  The district court found that the defendants are \u201cunincorporated \nassociations.\u201d  See Sokolow v. Palestine  Liberation Org., 60 F. Supp. \n3d 509, 523-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). \n\n153a \n \n \nDaimler was decided because the \u201cat home\u201d general juris-\ndiction test existed after Goodyear Dunlop Tire Opera-\ntions, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 (2011).  This argument \nis unavailing because this Court in Gucci looked to the test \nin Daimler as the appropriate test for general jurisdiction \nover a corporate entity.  See Gucci, 768 F.3d at 135-36.  \nThe defendants did not waive or forfeit their objection to \npersonal jurisdiction because they repeatedly and consist-\nently objected to personal jurisdiction and invoked Daim-\nler after this Court\u2019s decision in Gucci.  Furthermore, the \ndistrict court explicitly noted that the \u201cDefendants\u2019 mo-\ntions asserting lack of personal jurisdiction are not denied \nbased on a theory of waiver.\u201d  Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, \nat *2 n.2 (emphasis added). \nSecond, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants have \nno due process rights because the defendants are foreign \ngovernments and share many of the attributes typically \nassociated with a sovereign government.  Foreign sover-\neign states do not have due process rights but receive the \nprotection of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  See \nFrontera Res., 582 F.3d at 396-400.  The plaintiffs argue \nthat entities, like the defendants, lack due process rights, \nbecause they do not view themselves as part of a sovereign \nand are treated as a foreign government in other contexts.  \nThe plaintiffs do not cite any cases indicating that a non-\nsovereign entity with governmental attributes lacks due \nprocess rights.  All the cases cited by the plaintiffs stand \nfor the proposition that sovereign governments lack due \nprocess rights, and these cases have not been extended be-\nyond the scope of entities that are separate sovereigns, \nrecognized by the United States government as sover-\neigns, and therefore enjoy foreign sovereign immunity. \nWhile sovereign states are not entitled to due process \nprotection, see id. at 399, neither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state, and \nthe executive\u2019s determination of such a matter is \n\n154a \n \n \nconclusive.  See Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2088 \n(2015); see also Ungar, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 177 (\u201cThe PA \nand PLO\u2019s argument must fail because Palestine does not \nsatisfy the four criteria for statehood and is not a State \nunder prevailing international legal standards.\u201d); Knox, \n306 F. Supp. 2d at 431 (\u201c[T]here does not exist a state of \nPalestine which meets the legal criteria for statehood. . . \n.\u201d); accord Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 47 (\u201cIt is quite clear \nthat the PLO meets none of those requirements [for a \nstate].\u201d).  Because neither defendant is a state, the defend-\nants have due process rights.  See O\u2019Neill v. Asat Trust \nReg. (In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001), 714 F.3d \n659, 681-82 (2d Cir. 2013) (\u201cO\u2019Neill\u201d) (dismissing for lack \nof personal jurisdiction claims against charities, financial \ninstitutions, and other individuals who are alleged to have \nprovided support to Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda); Liv-\nnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 26 (due process clause applies to the \nPA (collecting cases)). \nThird, the plaintiffs and amici curiae Former Federal \nOfficials argue that the restrictive Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards cannot be imported into the \nFifth Amendment and that the due process clause of the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution,7 and not the Four-\nteenth Amendment,8 applies to the ATA and controls the \nanalysis in this case.  The argument is particularly im-\nportant in this case because the defendants rely on the \nstandard for personal jurisdiction set out in Daimler and \nthe Daimler Court explained that it was interpreting the \n \n7  The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part: \u201c. . . nor shall any \nperson . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law . . . .\u201d  U.S. CONST. amend. V. \n8  The Fourteenth Amendment states in relevant part: \u201c. . . nor shall \nany State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law . . . .\u201d  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV., \u00a7 1. \n\n155a \n \n \ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Daim-\nler, 134 S. Ct. at 751. \nThe plaintiffs and amici argue that the Fourteenth \nAmendment due process clause restricts state power but \nthe Fifth Amendment should be applied to the exercise of \nfederal power.  Their argument is that the Fourteenth \nAmendment imposes stricter limits on the personal juris-\ndiction that courts can exercise because that Amendment, \ngrounded in concepts of federalism, was intended to ref-\neree jurisdictional conflicts among the sovereign States.  \nThe Fifth Amendment, by contrast, imposes more lenient \nrestrictions because it contemplates disputes with foreign \nnations, which, unlike States, do not follow reciprocal rules \nand are not subject to our constitutional system.  See, e.g., \nJ. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion) \n(\u201cBecause the United States is a distinct sovereign, a de-\nfendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of \nthe courts of the United States but not of any particular \nState.  This is consistent with the premises and unique ge-\nnius of our Constitution.\u201d).  To conflate the due process re-\nquirements of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments, the \nplaintiffs and amici argue, would impose a unilateral con-\nstraint on United States courts, even when the political \nbranches conclude that personal jurisdiction over a de-\nfendant for extraterritorial conduct is in the national in-\nterest.9  \n \n9  The plaintiffs also point to the brief filed by the United States So-\nlicitor General in Daimler to support their argument that the due pro-\ncess standards for the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments vary. How-\never, the United States never advocated that the Fourteenth Amend-\nment standard would be inapplicable to Fifth Amendment cases and, \ninstead, urged the Court not to reach the issue. See Brief for the \nUnited States as Amicus Curaie Supporting Petitioner, Daim-\nlerChrysler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014) (No. 11-965), 2013 \nWL 3377321, at *3 n.1 (\u201cThis Court has consistently reserved the \nquestion whether its Fourteenth Amendment personal jurisdiction \n\n156a \n \n \nThis Court\u2019s precedents clearly establish the congru-\nence of due process analysis under both the Fourteenth \nand Fifth Amendments.  This Court has explained: \u201c[T]he \ndue process analysis [for purposes of the court\u2019s in perso-\nnam jurisdiction] is basically the same under both the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The principal differ-\nence is that under the Fifth Amendment the court can con-\nsider the defendant\u2019s contacts throughout the United \nStates, while under the Fourteenth Amendment only the \ncontacts with the forum state may be considered.\u201d  Chew \nv. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998). \nIndeed, this Court has already applied Fourteenth \nAmendment principles to Fifth Amendment civil terror-\nism cases.  For example, in O\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 673-74, this \nCourt applied Fourteenth Amendment due process cases \nto terrorism claims brought pursuant to the ATA in fed-\neral court.  See In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, \n538 F.3d 71, 93 (2d Cir. 2008), abrogated on other grounds \nby Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305 (2010); see also Tex. \nTrading & Milling Corp. v. Fed.  Republic of Nigeria, 647 \nF.2d 300, 315 n.37 (2d Cir. 1981) (declining to apply differ-\nent due-process standards in a case governed by the Fifth \nAmendment compared to one governed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment), overruled on other grounds by Frontera  \nRes., 582 F.3d at 400; GSS Grp. Ltd v. Nat\u2019l Port Auth., \n680 F.3d 805, 816-17 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (applying Fourteenth \nAmendment case law when considering minimum contacts \nunder the Fifth Amendment). \nAmici Federal Officials concede that our precedents \nsettle the issue, but they argue those cases were wrongly \n \nprecedents would apply in a case governed by the Fifth Amendment, \nand it should do so here.\u201d). \n\n157a \n \n \ndecided and urge us not to follow them.  We decline the \ninvitation to upend settled law.10 \nAccordingly, we conclude that the minimum contacts \nand fairness analysis is the same under the Fifth Amend-\nment and the Fourteenth Amendment in civil cases and \nproceed to analyze the jurisdictional question. \nIII. \nPursuant to the due process clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments, there are two parts to the due \nprocess test for personal jurisdiction as established by In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. 310, and its progeny: the \u201cmin-\nimum contacts\u201d inquiry and the \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry.  \nSee Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodri-\nguez, 305 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.).  The \nminimum contacts inquiry requires that the court deter-\nmine whether a defendant has sufficient minimum con-\ntacts with the forum to justify the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendant.  See Daimler, 134 S. \nCt. at 754; Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 788 (1984); Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316; Metro. Life Ins., 84 F.3d at 567-68.  \nThe reasonableness inquiry requires the court to deter-\nmine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction over \nthe defendant comports with \u201c\u2018traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice\u2019\u201d under the circumstances of \nthe particular case.  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 754 (quoting \nGoodyear, 564 U.S. at 923); Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-78 (1985). \nInternational Shoe distinguished between two exer-\ncises of personal jurisdiction: general jurisdiction and \n \n10  Amici argue for \u201cuniversal\u201d---or limitless---personal jurisdiction \nin terrorism cases. This Court has already rejected that suggestion. \nSee United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 107-08 (2d Cir. 2003) (per \ncuriam) (\u201c[T]errorism---unlike piracy, war crimes, and crimes against \nhumanity---does not provide a basis for universal jurisdiction.\u201d). \n\n158a \n \n \nspecific jurisdiction.  The district court in this case ruled \nonly on the issue of general jurisdiction.  We conclude that \ngeneral jurisdiction is absent; the question remains \nwhether the court may nonetheless assert its jurisdiction \nunder the doctrine of specific jurisdiction. \nA court may assert general personal jurisdiction over \na foreign defendant to hear any and all claims against that \ndefendant only when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with the \nState in which suit is brought \u201care so constant and perva-\nsive \u2018as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum \nState.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 751 (quoting Goodyear, 564 \nU.S. at 919); see also Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924.  \u201cSince \nInternational Shoe, \u2018specific jurisdiction has become the \ncenterpiece of modern jurisdiction theory, while general \njurisdiction [has played] a reduced rule.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. \nCt. at 755 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 925).  Accord-\ningly, there are \u201cfew\u201d Supreme Court opinions over the \npast half-century that deal with general jurisdiction.  Id. \n\u201cSpecific jurisdiction, on the other hand, depends on \nan affiliation between the forum and the underlying con-\ntroversy, principally, activity or an occurrence that takes \nplace in the forum State and is therefore subject to the \nState\u2019s regulation.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919 (altera-\ntions, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).  The \nexercise of specific jurisdiction depends on in-state activ-\nity that \u201cgave rise to the episode-in-suit.\u201d  Id. at 923 (quot-\ning Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 317) (emphasis in original).  In \ncertain circumstances, the \u201ccommission of certain \u2018single \nor occasional acts\u2019 in a State may be sufficient to render a \ncorporation answerable in that State with respect to those \nacts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the \nforum connections.\u201d  Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at \n318). \n\n159a \n \n \nA. \nThe district court concluded that it had general juris-\ndiction over the defendants; however, that conclusion re-\nlies on a misreading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in \nDaimler. \nIn Daimler, the plaintiffs asserted claims under the \nAlien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act \nof 1991, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1350 & note, as well as other \nclaims, arising from alleged torture that was committed in \nArgentina by the Argentinian government with the collab-\noration of an Argentina-based subsidiary of the German \ncorporate defendant.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 750-52.  \nThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Cali-\nfornia federal court could exercise general personal juris-\ndiction over the German corporation based on the contin-\nuous activities in California of the German corporation\u2019s \nindirect United States subsidiary.  See id. at 751.  Daimler \nconcluded that the German corporate parent, which was \nnot incorporated in California and did not have its princi-\npal place of business in California, could not be considered \nto be \u201cat home in California\u201d and subject to general juris-\ndiction there.  Id. at 762. \nDaimler analogized its \u201cat-home test\u201d to that of an in-\ndividual\u2019s domicile.  \u201c[F]or a corporation, it is an equiva-\nlent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded \nas at home.  With respect to a corporation, the place of in-\ncorporation and principal place of business are paradigm \nbases for general jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 760 (alterations, in-\nternal quotation marks, and citations omitted). \nAs an initial matter, while Daimler involved corpora-\ntions, and neither the PA nor the PLO is a corporation---\nthe PA is a non-sovereign government and the PLO is a \nforeign agent, and both are unincorporated associations, \nsee Part I.A---Daimler\u2019s reasoning was based on an anal-\nogy to general jurisdiction over individuals, and there is no \n\n160a \n \n \nreason to invent a different test for general personal juris-\ndiction depending on whether the defendant is an individ-\nual, a corporation, or another entity.  Indeed, in Gucci this \nCourt relied on Daimler when it found there was no gen-\neral personal jurisdiction over the Bank of China, a non-\nparty bank that was incorporated and headquartered in \nChina and owned by the Chinese government.  The Court \ndescribed the Daimler test as applicable to \u201centities.\u201d  \n\u201cGeneral, all-purpose jurisdiction permits a court to hear \n\u2018any and all claims\u2019 against an entity.\u201d  Gucci, 768 F.3d at \n134 (emphasis added); see id. at 134 n.13 (\u201cThe essence of \ngeneral personal jurisdiction is the ability to entertain \u2018any \nand all claims\u2019 against an entity based solely on the entity\u2019s \nactivities in the forum, rather than on the particulars of \nthe case before the court.\u201d).  Consequently, we consider \nthe PLO and the PA entities subject to the Daimler test \nfor general jurisdiction.  See Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at \n245-46; Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 28; Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d \nat 46. \nPursuant to Daimler, the question becomes, where \nare the PA and PLO \u201c\u2018fairly regarded as at home\u2019\u201d? 134 S. \nCt. at 761 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924).  The over-\nwhelming evidence shows that the defendants are \u201cat \nhome\u201d in Palestine, where they govern.  Palestine is the \ncentral seat of government for the PA and PLO.  The PA\u2019s \nauthority is limited to the West Bank and Gaza, and it has \nno independently operated offices anywhere else.  All PA \ngovernmental ministries, the Palestinian president, the \nParliament, and the Palestinian security services reside in \nPalestine. \nAs the District Court for the District of Columbia ob-\nserved, \u201c[i]t is common sense that the single ascertainable \nplace where a government such a[s] the Palestinian Au-\nthority should be amenable to suit for all purposes is the \nplace where it governs.  Here, that place is the West Bank, \nnot the United States.\u201d  Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 30; see \n\n161a \n \n \nalso Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 48.  The same analysis applies \nequally to the PLO, which during the relevant period \nmaintained its headquarters in Palestine and Amman, Jor-\ndan.  See Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 245 (\u201cDefendants\u2019 \nalleged contacts . . . do not suffice to render the PA and the \nPLO \u2018essentially at home\u2019 in the United States.\u201d) \nThe activities of the defendants\u2019 mission in Washing-\nton, D.C.---which the district court concluded simultane-\nously served as an office for the PLO and the PA, see \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *3---were limited to main-\ntaining an office in Washington, promoting the Palestinian \ncause in speeches and media appearances, and retaining a \nlobbying firm.  See id. at *4. \nThese contacts with the United States do not render \nthe PA and the PLO \u201cessentially at home\u201d in the United \nStates.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 754.  The commercial \ncontacts that the district court found supported general \njurisdiction are like those rejected as insufficient by the \nSupreme Court in Daimler.  In Daimler, the Supreme \nCourt held as \u201cunacceptably grasping\u201d a formulation that \nallowed for \u201cthe exercise of general jurisdiction in every \nState in which a corporation \u2018engages in a substantial, con-\ntinuous, and systematic course of business.\u2019\u201d  134 S. Ct. at \n761.  The Supreme Court found that a court in California \ncould not exercise general personal jurisdiction over the \nGerman parent company even though that company\u2019s in-\ndirect subsidiary was the largest supplier of luxury vehi-\ncles to the California market.  Id. at 752.  The Supreme \nCourt deemed Daimler\u2019s contacts with California \u201cslim\u201d \nand concluded that they would \u201chardly render it at home\u201d \nin California.  Id. at 760. \nDaimler\u2019s contacts with California were substantially \ngreater than the defendants\u2019 contacts with the United \nStates in this case.  But still the Supreme Court rejected \nthe proposition that Daimler should be subjected to \n\n162a \n \n \ngeneral personal jurisdiction in California for events that \noccurred anywhere in the world.  Such a regime would al-\nlow entities to be sued in many jurisdictions, not just the \njurisdictions where the entities were centered, for world-\nwide events unrelated to the jurisdiction where suit was \nbrought.  The Supreme Court found such a conception of \ngeneral personal jurisdiction to be incompatible with due \nprocess.  The Supreme Court explained: \nGeneral jurisdiction . . . calls for an appraisal of a cor-\nporation\u2019s activities in their entirety, nationwide and \nworldwide.  A corporation that operates in many \nplaces can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.  \nOtherwise, \u201cat home\u201d would be synonymous with \u201cdo-\ning business\u201d tests framed before specific jurisdiction \nevolved in the United States.  Nothing in Interna-\ntional Shoe and its progeny suggests that \u201ca particu-\nlar quantum of local activity\u201d should give a State au-\nthority over a \u201cfar larger quantum of . . . activity\u201d hav-\ning no connection to any in-state activity. \nId. at 762 n.20 (internal citations omitted).  Regardless of \nthe commercial contacts occasioned by the defendants\u2019 \nWashington, D.C. mission, there is no doubt that the \u201cfar \nlarger quantum\u201d of the defendants\u2019 activities took place in \nPalestine. \nThe district court held that the record before it was \n\u201cinsufficient to conclude that either defendant is \u2018at home\u2019 \nin a particular jurisdiction other than the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *2.  That conclusion is not \nsupported by the record.  The evidence demonstrates that \nthe defendants are \u201cat home\u201d in Palestine, where these \n\n163a \n \n \nentities are headquartered and from where they are di-\nrected.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20.11 \nThe district court also erred in placing the burden on \nthe defendants to prove that there exists \u201can alternative \nforum where Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could be brought, and \nwhere the foreign court could grant a substantially similar \nremedy.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *7.  Daimler im-\nposes no such burden.  In fact, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden \nto establish that the court has personal jurisdiction over \nthe defendants.  See Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda Ltd., 101 \nF.3d 863, 865 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201c[T]he plaintiff bears the ul-\ntimate burden of establishing jurisdiction over the defend-\nant by a preponderance of evidence . . . .\u201d); Metro. Life \nIns., 84 F.3d at 566-67; see also Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d \nat 243; Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 30; Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d \nat 49.12  \nFinally, the district court did not dispute the defend-\nants\u2019 ties to Palestine but concluded that the court had \ngeneral jurisdiction pursuant to an \u201cexception\u201d that the \nSupreme Court alluded to in a footnote in Daimler.  In \nDaimler, the Supreme Court did not \u201cforeclose the possi-\nbility that in an exceptional case, a corporation\u2019s opera-\ntions in a forum other than its formal place of \n \n11  It appears that the district court, when considering where the de-\nfendants were \u201cat home,\u201d limited its inquiry to areas that are within a \nsovereign nation. We see no basis in precedent for this limitation. \n12  The district court\u2019s focus on the importance of identifying an al-\nternative forum may have been borrowed inappositely from forum \nnon conveniens jurisprudence, pursuant to which a court considers (1) \nthe degree of deference to be afforded to the plaintiff\u2019s choice of fo-\nrum; (2) whether there is an adequate alternative forum for adjudicat-\ning the dispute; and (3) whether the balance of private and public in-\nterests tips in favor of adjudication in one forum or the other. See \nNorex Petroleum  Ltd. v. Access Indus., Inc., 416 F.3d 146, 153 (2d \nCir. 2005). However, that is not the test for general jurisdiction under \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20. \n\n164a \n \n \nincorporation or principal place of business may be so sub-\nstantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation \nat home in that State.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19 (citing Per-\nkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 447-48 \n(1952)). \nDaimler analyzed the 1952 Perkins case, \u201c\u2018the text-\nbook case of general jurisdiction appropriately exercised \nover a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in \nthe forum.\u2019\u201d Id. at 755-56 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at \n928).  The defendant in Perkins was a company, Benguet \nConsolidated Mining Company (\u201cBenguet\u201d), which was in-\ncorporated under the laws of the Philippines, where it op-\nerated gold and silver mines.  During World War II, the \nJapanese occupied the Philippines, and Benguet\u2019s presi-\ndent relocated to Ohio, where he kept an office, maintained \nthe company\u2019s files, and oversaw the company\u2019s activities.  \nPerkins, 342 U.S. at 447-48.  The plaintiff, a nonresident \nof Ohio, sued Benguet in a state court in Ohio on a claim \nthat neither arose in Ohio nor related to the corporation\u2019s \nactivities in Ohio, but the Supreme Court nevertheless \nheld that the Ohio courts could constitutionally exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  Id. at \n438, 440.  As the Supreme Court later observed: \u201c\u2018Ohio was \nthe corporation\u2019s principal, if temporary, place of busi-\nness.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 756 (quoting Keeton v. Hus-\ntler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 780 n.11 (1984)). \nSuch exceptional circumstances did not exist in Daim-\nler, id. at 761 n.19, or in Gucci.  In Gucci, this Court held \nthat, while a nonparty bank had branch offices in the fo-\nrum, it was not an \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which to exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction where the bank was incorpo-\nrated and headquartered elsewhere, and its contacts were \nnot \u201c\u2018so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essen-\ntially at home in the forum.\u2019\u201d 768 F.3d at 135 (quoting \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19). \n\n165a \n \n \nThe defendants\u2019 activities in this case, as with those of \nthe defendants in Daimler and Gucci, \u201cplainly do not ap-\nproach\u201d the required level of contact to qualify as \u201cexcep-\ntional.\u201d  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 & n.19.  The PLO and \nPA have not transported their principle \u201chome\u201d to the \nUnited States, even temporarily, as the defendant had in \nPerkins.  See Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d \n619, 628-30 (2d Cir. 2016). \nAccordingly, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Daimler, the district court could not properly \nexercise general personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants. \nB. \nThe district court did not rule explicitly on whether it \nhad specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants, but \nthe question was sufficiently briefed and argued to allow \nus to reach that issue. \n\u201cThe inquiry whether a forum State may assert spe-\ncific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant focuses on \nthe relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation.  For a State to exercise jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process, the defendant\u2019s suit-related conduct \nmust create a substantial connection with the forum \nState.\u201d  Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014) (in-\nternal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The rela-\ntionship between the defendant and the forum \u201cmust arise \nout of contacts that the \u2018defendant himself\u2019 creates with \nthe forum.\u201d  Id. at 1122 (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at \n475) (emphasis in original).  The \u201c\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 anal-\nysis looks to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State \nitself, not the defendant\u2019s contacts with persons who re-\nside there.\u201d  Id.  And the \u201csame principles apply when in-\ntentional torts are involved.\u201d  Id. at 1123. \nThe question in this case is whether the defendants\u2019 \nsuit-related conduct\u2014their role in the six terror attacks at \n\n166a \n \n \nissue\u2014creates a substantial connection with the forum \nState pursuant to the ATA.  The relevant \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d by the defendants was the conduct that could \nhave subjected them to liability under the ATA.  On its \nface, the conduct in this case did not involve the defend-\nants\u2019 conduct in the United States in violation of the ATA.  \nWhile the plaintiff-victims were United States citizens, the \nterrorist attacks occurred in and around Jerusalem, and \nthe defendants\u2019 activities in violation of the ATA occurred \noutside the United States. \nThe ATA provides: \nAny national of the United States injured in his or her \nperson, property, or business by reason of an act of \ninternational terrorism, or his or her estate, survi-\nvors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any appropriate \ndistrict court of the United States and shall recover \nthreefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost \nof the suit, including attorney\u2019s fees. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). \nTo prevail under the ATA, a plaintiff must prove \n\u201cthree formal elements: unlawful action, the requisite \nmental state, and causation.\u201d  Sokolow, 60 F. Supp. 3d at \n514 (quoting Gill v. Arab Bank, PLC, 893 F. Supp. 2d 542, \n553 (E.D.N.Y. 2012)) (emphasis in original). \nTo establish an \u201cunlawful action,\u201d the plaintiffs must \nshow that their injuries resulted from an act of \u201cinterna-\ntional terrorism.\u201d  The ATA defines \u201cinternational terror-\nism\u201d as activities that, among other things, \u201cinvolve violent \nacts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of \nthe criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or \nthat would be a criminal violation if committed within the \njurisdiction of the United States or of any State.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(A).  The acts must also appear to be in-\ntended \u201c(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) \nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \n\n167a \n \n \ncoercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by \nmass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(B)(i)-(iii). \nThe plaintiffs asserted that the defendants were re-\nsponsible on a respondeat superior theory for a variety of \npredicate acts, including murder and attempted murder, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111, 2332, use of a destructive device on a \nmass transportation vehicle, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1992, detonating \nan explosive device on a public transportation system, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2332f, and conspiracy to commit those acts, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 371.  See Sokolow, 60 F. Supp. 3d at 515.  They \nalso asserted that the defendants directly violated federal \nand state antiterrorism laws, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, \nby providing material support to FTO-designated groups \n(the AAMB and Hamas) and by harboring persons whom \nthe defendants knew or had reasonable grounds to believe \ncommitted or were about to commit an offense relating to \nterrorism, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339 et seq.; see also Sokolow, 60 \nF. Supp. 3d at 520-21, 523. \nThe ATA further limits international terrorism to ac-\ntivities that \u201coccur primarily outside the territorial juris-\ndiction of the United States, or transcend national bound-\naries in terms of the means by which they are accom-\nplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or \ncoerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or \nseek asylum.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(C) (emphasis added). \nThe bombings and shootings here occurred entirely \noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  \nThus, the question becomes: What other constitutionally \nsufficient connection did the commission of these torts by \nthese defendants have to this jurisdiction? \nThe jury found in a special verdict that the PA and the \nPLO were liable for the attacks under several theories.  In \nall of the attacks, the jury found that the PA and the PLO \nwere liable for providing material support or resources \n\n168a \n \n \nthat were used in preparation for, or in carrying out, each \nattack. \nIn addition, the jury found that in five of the attacks--\n-the January 22, 2002 Jaffa Road Shooting, the January \n27, 2002 Jaffa Road Bombing, the March 21, 2002 King \nGeorge Street Bombing, the July 31, 2002 Hebrew Uni-\nversity Bombing, and the January 29, 2004 Bus No. 19 \nBombing---the PA was liable because an employee of the \nPA, acting within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment \nand in furtherance of the activities of the PA, either car-\nried out, or knowingly provided material support or re-\nsources that were used in preparation for, or in carrying \nout, the attack. \nThe jury also found that in one of the attacks---the \nJuly 31, 2002 Hebrew University Bombing---the PLO and \nthe PA harbored or concealed a person who the organiza-\ntions knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe, commit-\nted or was about to commit the attack. \nFinally, the jury found that in three attacks---the June \n19, 2002 French Hill Bombing, the July 31, 2002 Hebrew \nUniversity Bombing, and the January 29, 2004 Bus No. 19 \nBombing---the PA and PLO knowingly provided material \nsupport to an FTO-designated group (the AAMB or Ha-\nmas). \nBut these actions, as heinous as they were, were not \nsufficiently connected to the United States to provide spe-\ncific personal jurisdiction in the United States.  There is \nno basis to conclude that the defendants participated in \nthese acts in the United States or that their liability for \nthese acts resulted from their actions that did occur in the \nUnited States. \nIn short, the defendants were liable for tortious activ-\nities that occurred outside the United States and affected \nUnited States citizens only because they were victims of \nindiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.  The \n\n169a \n \n \nresidence or citizenship of the plaintiffs is an insufficient \nbasis for specific jurisdiction over the defendants.  A focus \non the relationship of the defendants, the forum, and the \ndefendants\u2019 suit-related conduct points to the conclusion \nthat there is no specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants for the torts in this case.  See Walden, 134 S. Ct. \nat 1121; see also Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923. \nIn the absence of such a relationship, the plaintiffs ar-\ngue on appeal that the Court has specific jurisdiction for \nthree reasons.  First, the plaintiffs argue that, under the \n\u201ceffects test,\u201d a defendant acting entirely outside the \nUnited States is subject to jurisdiction \u201cif the defendant \nexpressly aimed its conduct\u201d at the United States.  Licci \nex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d \n161, 173 (2d Cir. 2013).  The plaintiffs point to the jury ver-\ndict that found that the defendants provided material sup-\nport to designated FTOs---the AAMB and Hamas---and \nthat the defendants\u2019 employees, acting within the scope of \ntheir employment, killed and injured United States citi-\nzens.  They also argue that the defendants\u2019 terror attacks \nwere intended to influence United States policy to favor \nthe defendants\u2019 political goals.  Second, the plaintiffs ar-\ngue that the defendants purposefully availed themselves \nof the forum by establishing a continuous presence in the \nUnited States and pressuring United States government \npolicy by conducting terror attacks in Israel and threaten-\ning further terrorism unless Israel withdrew from Gaza \nand the West Bank.  See Banks Brussels Lambert, 305 \nF.3d at 128.  Third, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants \nconsented to personal jurisdiction under the ATA by ap-\npointing an agent to accept process. \nWalden forecloses the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.  First, \nwith regard to the effects test, the defendant must \u201cex-\npressly aim[]\u201d his conduct at the United States.  See Licci, \n732 F. 3d at 173.  Pursuant to Walden, it is \u201cinsufficient to \nrely on a defendant\u2019s \u2018random, fortuitous, or attenuated \n\n170a \n \n \ncontacts\u2019 or on the \u2018unilateral activity\u2019 of a plaintiff\u201d with \nthe forum to establish specific jurisdiction.  Walden, 134 S. \nCt. at 1123 (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475).  While \nthe killings and related acts of terrorism are the kind of \nactivities that the ATA proscribes, those acts were uncon-\nnected to the forum and were not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.  And \u201c[a] forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdic-\ntion over an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be \nbased on intentional conduct by the defendant that creates \nthe necessary contacts with the forum.\u201d  Id.  That is not \nthe case here. \nThe plaintiffs argue that United States citizens were \ntargets of these attacks, but their own evidence estab-\nlishes the random and fortuitous nature of the terror at-\ntacks.  For example, at trial, the plaintiffs emphasized how \nthe \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d and targeted \u201cChristians \nand Jews, Israelis, Americans, people from all over the \nworld.\u201d  J.A. 3836.  Evidence at trial showed that the \nshooters fired \u201cindiscriminately,\u201d J.A. 3944, and chose \nsites for their suicide bomb attacks that were \u201cfull of peo-\nple,\u201d J.A. 4030-31, because they sought to kill \u201cas many \npeople as possible,\u201d J.A. 3944; see also J.A. 4031. \nThe plaintiffs argue that \u201c[i]t is a fair inference that \nDefendants intended to hit American citizens by continu-\ning a terror campaign that continuously hit Americans . . . \n.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. at 37 (emphasis in original).  But the Constitu-\ntion requires much more purposefully directed contact \nwith the forum.  For example, the Supreme Court has \u201cup-\nheld the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants who \nhave purposefully \u2018reach[ed] out beyond\u2019 their State and \ninto another by, for example, entering a contractual rela-\ntionship that \u2018envisioned continuing and wide-reaching \ncontacts\u2019 in the forum State,\u201d Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1122 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Burger King, 472 U.S. at \n479-80), or \u201cby circulating magazines to \u2018deliberately ex-\nploi[t]\u2019 a market in the forum State.\u201d  Id. (alteration in \n\n171a \n \n \noriginal) (quoting Keeton, 465 U.S. at 781).  But there was \nno such purposeful connection to the forum in this case, \nand it would be impermissible to speculate based on scant \nevidence what the terrorists intended to do. \nFurthermore, the facts of Walden also suggest that a \ndefendant\u2019s mere knowledge that a plaintiff resides in a \nspecific jurisdiction would be insufficient to subject a de-\nfendant to specific jurisdiction in that jurisdiction if the de-\nfendant does nothing in connection with the tort in that ju-\nrisdiction.  In Walden, the petitioner was a police officer \nin Georgia who was working as a deputized Drug Enforce-\nment Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) agent at the Atlanta air-\nport.  He was informed that the respondents, Gina Fiore \nand Keith Gipson, were flying from San Juan, Puerto Rico \nthrough Atlanta en route to their final destination in Las \nVegas, Nevada.  See Joint Appendix, Walden v. Fiore, \n2013 WL 2390248, *41-42 (U.S.) (Decl. of Anthony Wal-\nden).  Walden and his DEA team stopped the respondents \nand searched their bags in Atlanta and examined their \nCalifornia drivers\u2019 licenses.  Id.; Walden, 134 S. Ct. at \n1119.  Walden found almost $100,000 in cash in the re-\nspondents\u2019 carry-on bag and seized it, giving rise to a claim \nfor an unconstitutional search under Bivens v. Six Un-\nknown Named Agents  of the Federal Bureau of Narcot-\nics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  See Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1119-20.  \nThe Supreme Court found that the petitioner\u2019s contacts \nwith Nevada were insufficient to establish personal juris-\ndiction over the petitioner in a Nevada federal court, even \nthough Walden knew that the respondents were destined \nfor Nevada.  See id. at 1119. \nIn this case, the plaintiffs point us to no evidence that \nthese indiscriminate terrorist attacks were specifically \ntargeted against United States citizens, and the mere \nknowledge that United States citizens might be wronged \nin a foreign country goes beyond the jurisdictional limit \nset forth in Walden. \n\n172a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs cite to several cases to support their ar-\ngument that specific jurisdiction is warranted under an \n\u201ceffects test.\u201d  Those cases are easily distinguishable from \nthis case.  Indeed, they point to the kinds of circumstances \nthat would give rise to specific jurisdiction under the ATA, \nwhich are not present here. \nFor example, in Mwani v. Bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 \n(D.C. Cir. 2005), the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit found that specific personal jurisdiction \nover Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda was supported by al-\nlegations that they \u201corchestrated the bombing of the \nAmerican embassy in Nairobi, not only to kill both Amer-\nican and Kenyan employees inside the building, but to \ncause pain and sow terror in the embassy\u2019s home country, \nthe United States,\u201d as well as allegations of \u201can ongoing \nconspiracy to attack the United States, with overt acts oc-\ncurring within this country\u2019s borders.\u201d  Id. at 13 (empha-\nsis added).  The plaintiffs pointed to the 1993 World Trade \nCenter bombing, as well as the plot to bomb the United \nNations, Federal Plaza, and the Lincoln and Holland Tun-\nnels in New York.  Id.  Furthermore, the Court of Appeals \nfound that bin Laden and al Qaeda \u201c\u2018purposefully directed\u2019 \n[their] activities at residents\u201d of the United States, and \nthat the case \u201cresult[ed] from injuries to the plaintiffs \u2018that \narise out of or relate to those activities,\u2019\u201d id. (quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472). \n\u201c[E]xercising specific jurisdiction because the victim \nof a foreign attack happened to be an American would run \nafoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u2018[d]ue process \nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum \nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not based \non the \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\u201d contacts he \nmakes by interacting with other persons affiliated with the \nState.\u2019\u201d Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 248 (quoting Walden, \n134 S. Ct. at 1123); see Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 52 (distin-\nguishing Mwani); see also In re Terrorist  Attacks on Sept. \n\n173a \n \n \n11, 2001, 538 F.3d at 95-96 (holding that even if Saudi \nprinces could and did foresee that Muslim charities would \nuse their donations to finance the September 11 attacks, \nproviding indirect funding to an organization that was \nopenly hostile to the United States did not constitute the \ntype of intentional conduct necessary to constitute pur-\nposeful direction of activities at the forum); Livnat, 82 F. \nSupp. 3d at 33. \nThe plaintiffs also rely on O\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 659, \nwhich related to the September 11 attacks.  In that case, \nthis Court first clarified that \u201cspecific personal jurisdiction \nproperly exists where the defendant took \u2018intentional, and \nallegedly tortious, actions . . . expressly aimed\u2019 at the fo-\nrum.\u201d  Id. at 674 (quoting Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  This \nCourt also noted that, \u201cthe fact that harm in the forum is \nforeseeable . . . is insufficient for the purpose of establish-\ning specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\u201d  Id.  \nThis Court then held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were \ninsufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over about \ntwo dozen defendants, but that jurisdictional discovery \nwas warranted for twelve other defendants whose \u201calleged \nsupport of al Qaeda [was] more direct.\u201d  Id. at 678; see also \nid. at 656-66.  Those defendants \u201callegedly controlled and \nmanaged some of [the front] \u2018charitable organizations\u2019 \nand, through their positions of control, they allegedly sent \nfinancial and other material support directly to al Qaeda \nwhen al Qaeda allegedly was known to be targeting the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. (second emphasis added). \nThe plaintiffs argue that this Court should likewise \nfind jurisdiction because the defendants\u2019 \u201cdirect, knowing \nprovision of material support to designated FTOs [in this \ncase, Hamas and the AAMB] is enough---standing alone--\n-to sustain specific jurisdiction because they knowingly \naimed their conduct at U.S. interests.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. at 36.  But \nthat argument misreads O\u2019Neill.  In O\u2019Neill, this Court \nemphasized that the mere \u201cfact that harm in the forum is \n\n174a \n \n \nforeseeable\u201d was \u201cinsufficient for the purpose of establish-\ning specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant,\u201d 714 \nF.3d at 674, and the Court did not end its inquiry when it \nconcluded that the defendants may have provided support \nto terror organizations.  Indeed, the Court held that \u201cfac-\ntual issues persist with respect to whether this support \nwas \u2018expressly aimed\u2019 at the United States,\u201d warranting \njurisdictional discovery.  Id. at 678-79.  The Court looked \nat the specific aim of the group receiving support---partic-\nularly that al Qaeda was \u201cknown to be targeting the \nUnited States\u201d---and not simply that it and other defend-\nants were \u201cterrorist organizations.\u201d  Id. at 678.13 \nThe plaintiffs also cite Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 783.  \nIn that case, a California actress brought a libel suit in Cal-\nifornia state court against a reporter and an editor, both \nof whom worked for a tabloid at the tabloid\u2019s Florida head-\nquarters.  Id. at 784.  The plaintiff\u2019s claims were based on \nan article written and edited by the defendants in Florida \nfor the tabloid, which had a California circulation of about \n600,000.  Id. at 784-86.  The Supreme Court held that Cal-\nifornia\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants for a libel action was proper based on the effects of \nthe defendants\u2019 conduct in California.  Id. at 788.  \u201cThe ar-\nticle was drawn from California sources, and the brunt of \nthe harm, in terms both of respondent\u2019s emotional distress \nand the injury to her professional reputation, was suffered \nin California,\u201d the Supreme Court held.  Id. at 788-89.  \u201cIn \n \n13  Furthermore, the mere designation of a group as an FTO does not \nreflect that the organization has aimed its conduct at the United \nStates. The Secretary of State may \u201cdesignate an organization as a \nforeign terrorist organization\u201d if the Secretary finds \u201cthe organization \nis a foreign organization,\u201d \u201cthe organization engages in terrorist ac-\ntivity,\u201d \u201cor retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist ac-\ntivity or terrorism,\u201d and \u201cthe terrorist activity or terrorism of the or-\nganization threatens the security of United States nationals or the na-\ntional security of the United States.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a)(1)(A)-(C). \n\n175a \n \n \nsum, California is the focal point both of the story and of \nthe harm suffered.\u201d  Id. at 789 (emphasis added); see also \nWalden, 134 S. Ct. at 1123 (describing the contacts identi-\nfied in Calder as \u201cample\u201d to support specific jurisdiction).  \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Walden, the jurisdic-\ntional inquiry in Calder focused on the relationship among \nthe defendant, the forum, and the litigation.  Walden, 134 \nS. Ct. at 1123. \nUnlike in Calder, it cannot be said that the United \nStates is the focal point of the torts alleged in this litiga-\ntion.  In this case, the United States is not the nucleus of \nthe harm---Israel is.  See Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 51. \nFinally, the plaintiffs rely on two criminal cases, \nUnited  States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2003) (per \ncuriam), and United States v. Al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108 (2d \nCir. 2011), for their argument that the \u201ceffects test\u201d sup-\nports jurisdiction.  In both cases, this Court applied the \ndue process test for asserting jurisdiction over extraterri-\ntorial criminal conduct, which differs from the test appli-\ncable in this civil case, see Al Kassar, 660 F.3d at 118; \nYousef, 327 F.3d at 111-12, and does not require a nexus \nbetween the specific criminal conduct and harm within the \nUnited States.  See also United States v. Murillo, No. 15-\n4235, 2016 WL 3257016, at *3 (4th Cir. June 14, 2016)(\u201c[I]t \nis not arbitrary to prosecute a defendant in the United \nStates if his actions affected significant American inter-\nests---even if the defendant did not mean to affect those \ninterests.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omit-\nted)).  In order to apply a federal criminal statute to a de-\nfendant extraterritorially consistent with due process, \n\u201c\u2018there must be a sufficient nexus between the defendant \nand the United States, so that such application would not \nbe arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.\u2019  For non-citizens \nacting entirely abroad, a jurisdictional nexus exists when \nthe aim of that activity is to cause harm inside the United \nStates or to U.S. citizens or interests.\u201d  Al Kassar, 660 \n\n176a \n \n \nF.3d 108, 118 (emphasis added) (quoting Yousef, 327 F.3d \nat 111). \nIn a civil action, as Walden makes clear, \u201cthe defend-\nant\u2019s suit-related conduct must create a substantial con-\nnection with the forum State.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 1121. \nEven setting aside the fact that both Yousef and Al \nKassar applied the more expansive due process test in \ncriminal cases, the defendants in both cases had more sub-\nstantial connections with the United States than the de-\nfendants have in the current litigation.  Yousef involved a \ncriminal prosecution for the bombing of an airplane trav-\neling from the Philippines to Japan.  See 327 F.3d at 79.  \nThe Yousef defendants \u201cconspired to attack a dozen \nUnited States-flag aircraft in an effort to inflict injury on \nthis country and its people and influence American foreign \npolicy, and their attack on the Philippine Airlines flight \nwas a \u2018test-run\u2019 in furtherance of this conspiracy.\u201d  Id. at \n112. \nIn Al Kassar, several defendants were convicted of \nconspiring to kill United States officers, to acquire and ex-\nport anti-aircraft missiles, and knowingly to provide mate-\nrial support to a terrorist organization; two were also con-\nvicted of conspiring to kill United States citizens and of \nmoney laundering.  660 F.3d at 115.  On appeal, the de-\nfendants challenged their convictions on a number of \ngrounds, including that the defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment \ndue process rights were violated by prosecuting them for \nactivities that occurred abroad.  Id. at 117-18.  This Court \nrejected that argument because the defendants conspired \nto sell arms to a group \u201cwith the understanding that they \nwould be used to kill Americans and destroy U.S. prop-\nerty; the aim therefore was to harm U.S. citizens and in-\nterests and to threaten the security of the United States.\u201d  \nId. at 118. \n\n177a \n \n \nIn this case, the defendants undertook terror attacks \nwithin Israel, and there is no evidence the attacks specifi-\ncally targeted United States citizens.  See Safra, 82 F. \nSupp. 3d at 53-54; see also Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 34. \nAccordingly, in the present case, specific jurisdiction \nis not appropriate under the \u201ceffects test.\u201d \nSecond, Walden undermines the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments \nthat the defendants met the \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d test \nby establishing a continuous presence in the United States \nand pressuring United States government policy.  The em-\nphasis on the defendants\u2019 Washington, D.C. mission con-\nfuses the issue: Walden requires that the \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d---here, the terror attacks in Israel---have a \u201csub-\nstantial connection with the forum.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 1121.  \nThe defendants\u2019 Washington mission and its associated \nlobbying efforts do not support specific personal jurisdic-\ntion on the ATA claims.  The defendants cannot be made \nto answer in this forum \u201cwith respect to matters unrelated \nto the forum connections.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923; see \nalso Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 247 (\u201cCourts typically re-\nquire that the plaintiff show some sort of causal relation-\nship between a defendant\u2019s U.S. contacts and the episode \nin suit.\u201d). \nThe plaintiffs argue on appeal that the defendants in-\ntended their terror campaign to influence not just Israel, \nbut also the United States.  They point to trial evidence---\nspecifically pamphlets published by the PA---that, the \nplaintiffs argue, shows that the defendants were attempt-\ning to influence United States policy toward the Israel-\nPalestinian conflict.  The exhibits themselves speak in \nbroad terms of how United States interests in the region \nare in danger and how the United States and Europe \nshould exert pressure on Israel to change its practices to-\nward the Palestinians.  It is insufficient for purposes of due \nprocess to rely on evidence that a political organization \n\n178a \n \n \nsought to influence United States policy, without some \nother connection among the activities underlying the liti-\ngation, the defendants, and the forum.  Such attenuated \nactivity is insufficient under Walden. \nThe plaintiffs cite Licci, 732 F.3d 161, to support their \nargument that the defendants meet the purposeful avail-\nment test.  But the circumstances of that case are distin-\nguishable and illustrate why the defendants here do not \nmeet that test.  In Licci, American, Canadian, and Israeli \ncitizens who were injured or whose family members were \nkilled in a series of terrorist rocket attacks by Hizbollah in \nIsrael brought an action under the ATA and other laws \nagainst the Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL (\u201cLCB\u201d), \nwhich allegedly facilitated Hizbollah\u2019s acts by using corre-\nspondent banking accounts at a defendant New York bank \n(American Express Bank Ltd.) to effectuate wire trans-\nfers totaling several million dollars on Hizbollah\u2019s behalf.  \nId. at 164-66.  This Court concluded that the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants was constitu-\ntional because of the defendants\u2019 \u201crepeated use of New \nYork\u2019s banking system, as an instrument for accomplish-\ning the alleged wrongs for which the plaintiffs seek re-\ndress.\u201d  Id. at 171.  These contacts constituted \u201c\u2018purpose-\nful[] avail[ment] . . . of the privilege of doing business in \n[New York],\u2019 so as to permit the subjecting of LCB to spe-\ncific jurisdiction within the Southern District of New York \n. . . .\u201d  Id. (quoting Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at \n127). \n\u201cIt should hardly be unforeseeable to a bank that se-\nlects and makes use of a particular forum\u2019s banking sys-\ntem that it might be subject to the burden of a lawsuit in \nthat forum for wrongs related to, and arising from, that \nuse.\u201d  Id. at 171-72 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). \nIn Licci, this Court also distinguished the \u201ceffects \ntest\u201d theory of personal jurisdiction which is \u201ctypically \n\n179a \n \n \ninvoked where (unlike here) the conduct that forms the \nbasis for the controversy occurs entirely out-of-forum, and \nthe only relevant jurisdictional contacts with the forum are \ntherefore in-forum effects harmful to the plaintiff.\u201d  Id. at \n173 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).  The Court held \nthat the effects test was inappropriate because \u201cthe con-\nstitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign \ndefendant\u201d turned on conduct that \u201coccur[ed] within the \nforum,\u201d id. (emphasis in original), namely the repeated use \nof bank accounts in New York to support the alleged \nwrongs for which the plaintiffs sued. \nIn this case, there is no such connection between the \nconduct on which the alleged personal jurisdiction is based \nand the forum.  And the connections the defendants do \nhave with the United States---the Washington, D.C. and \nNew York missions---revolve around lobbying activities \nthat are not proscribed by the ATA and are not connected \nto the wrongs for which the plaintiffs here seek redress. \nAt a hearing before the district court, the plaintiffs \nalso cited Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d 120, as their \n\u201cbest case\u201d for their purposeful availment argument.  See \nJ.A. 1128.  But that case, too, is distinguishable.  There, a \nclient bank sued its lawyers for legal malpractice that oc-\ncurred in Puerto Rico.  Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d \nat 123.  This Court held that the Puerto Rican law firm \ndefendant had sufficient minimum contacts with the New \nYork forum and purposely availed itself of the privilege of \ndoing business in New York, because, although the law \nfirm did not solicit the bank as a client in New York, the \nfirm maintained an apartment in New York partially for \nthe purpose of better servicing its New York clients, the \nfirm faxed newsletters regarding Puerto Rican legal de-\nvelopments to persons in New York, the firm had numer-\nous New York clients, and its marketing materials touted \nthe firm\u2019s close relationship with the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York. Id. at 127-29.  \u201cThe engagement which \n\n180a \n \n \ngave rise to the dispute here is not simply one of a string \nof fortunate coincidences for the firm.  Rather, the picture \nwhich emerges from the above facts is that of a law firm \nwhich seeks to be known in the New York legal market, \nmakes efforts to promote and maintain a client base there, \nand profits substantially therefrom.\u201d  Id. at 128.  This \nCourt held that there was \u201cnothing fundamentally unfair \nabout requiring the firm to defend itself in the New York \ncourts when a dispute arises from its representation of a \nNew York client---a representation which developed in a \nmarket it had deliberately cultivated and which, after all, \nthe firm voluntarily undertook.\u201d  Id. at 129.  In short, the \ndefendants\u2019 contacts with the forum were sufficiently re-\nlated to the malpractice claims that were at issue in the \nsuit. \nThat is not the case here.  The plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not \narise from the defendants\u2019 purposeful contacts with the fo-\nrum.  And where the defendant in Bank Brussels Lambert \npurposefully and repeatedly reached into New York to ob-\ntain New York clients---and as a result of those activities, \nit obtained a representation for which it was sued---in this \ncase, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not arise from any activity \nby the defendants in this forum. \nThus, in this case, unlike in Licci and Bank Brussels \nLambert, the defendants are not subject to specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction based on a \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d the-\nory because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not arise from the de-\nfendants\u2019 activity in the forum. \nThird, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction under the ATA by appoint-\ning an agent to accept process.  It is clear that the ATA \npermitted service of process on the representative of the \nPLO and PA in Washington.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a).  \nHowever, the statute does not answer the constitutional \nquestion of whether due process is satisfied. \n\n181a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs contend that under United States v. \nScophony Corp. of America, 333 U.S. 795 (1948), meeting \nthe statutory requirement for service of process suffices \nto establish personal jurisdiction.  But Scophony does not \nstand for that proposition.  The defendant in Scophony \n\u201cwas \u2018transacting business\u2019 of a substantial character in \nthe New York district at the times of service, so as to es-\ntablish venue there,\u201d and so that \u201csuch a ruling presents \nno conceivable element of offense to \u2018traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at 818 (quoting Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316).  Thus, Scophony affirms the under-\nstanding, echoed by this Court in Licci, 673 F.3d at 60, and \nO\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 673-74, that due process analysis---\nconsiderations of minimum contacts and reasonableness--\n-applies even when federal service-of-process statutes are \nsatisfied.  Simply put, \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion must comport with constitutional due process princi-\nples.\u201d  Licci, 673 F.3d at 60; see also Brown, 814 F.3d at \n641.  As explained above, due process is not satisfied in this \ncase, and the courts have neither general nor specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendants, regardless of the \nservice-of-process statute. \nIn sum, because the terror attacks in Israel at issue \nhere were not expressly aimed at the United States and \nbecause the deaths and injuries suffered by the American \nplaintiffs in these attacks were \u201crandom [and] fortuitous\u201d \nand because lobbying activities regarding American policy \ntoward Israel are insufficiently \u201csuit-related conduct\u201d to \nsupport specific jurisdiction, the Court lacks specific juris-\ndiction over these defendants.  Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121, \n1123. \n*** \nThe terror machine gun attacks and suicide bombings \nthat triggered this suit and victimized these plaintiffs were \nunquestionably horrific.  But the federal courts cannot \n\n182a \n \n \nexercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits pre-\nscribed by the due process clause of the Constitution, no \nmatter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally \ncompelling the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. \nThe district court could not constitutionally exercise \neither general or specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants in this case.  Accordingly, this case must be dis-\nmissed. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the par-\nties.  To the extent not specifically addressed above, they \nare either moot or without merit.  For the reasons ex-\nplained above, we VACATE the judgment of the district \ncourt and REMAND the case to the district court with in-\nstructions to DISMISS the case for want of jurisdiction. \n\n \n \n(183a) \nAPPENDIX H \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n---------------------------------------- \nX  \nMARK I.

Defendants prematurely renewed their mo-\ntion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) during jurisdictional discovery, \nand this Court denied the motion without prejudice to re-\nnew after the completion of jurisdictional discovery. See \nDocket ## 66, 79. After the Magistrate Judge declared \ndiscovery complete, Defendants properly filed the instant \nmotion to dismiss. See Docket ## 80, 67. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nTo withstand a 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff \n\u201cbears the burden of showing [by a preponderance of the \nevidence] that the court has jurisdiction over the defend-\nant.\u201d In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Lithog., 334 \nF.3d 204, 206 (2d Cir. 2003); Landoil Resources Corp. v. \nAlexander & Alexander Servs., Inc., 918 F.2d 1039, 1043 \n(2d Cir. 1990). The showing necessary to satisfy this bur-\nden is more demanding when, as is the case here, the par-\nties have completed jurisdictional discovery.3 Whereas le-\ngally sufficient allegations are alone sufficient to make a \nprima facie showing where no evidentiary hearing has \nbeen held, or when the parties have not engaged in juris-\ndictional discovery, \u201c[a]fter discovery, the plaintiff\u2019s prima \nfacie showing . . . must include an averment of facts that, \nif credited by the trier, would suffice to establish \n \n3 It is appropriate to apply the higher burden in the present case \nregardless of how dissatisfied Plaintiffs may be with Defendants\u2019 pro-\nductions. The appropriate time to seek relief for such grievances has \nexpired now that jurisdictional discovery is complete. \n\n189a \n \n \njurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d4 Ball v. Metallurgic Ho-\nboken \u2014 Overpelt S.A., 902 F.2d 194, 197 (2d Cir. 1990); \nsee also Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 \nF.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir. 2010). The Court is to accept all aver-\nments of jurisdictional facts as true, and construe the \npleadings, affidavits, and any doubts in plaintiff\u2019s favor. \nSee In re Magnetic Audiotape, 334 F.3d at 206; PDK \nLabs. Inc. v. Friedlander, 103 F.3d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir. \n1997); see also Whitaker v. American Telecasting Inc., 261 \nF.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting A.I. Trade Fin., Inc. \nv. Petra Bank, 989 F.2d 76, 79-80 (2d Cir. 1993)). \nGENERAL JURISDICTION \nIn the context of ATA litigation, a plaintiff makes a \nprima facie showing of personal jurisdiction if: (1) service \nof process was properly effected as to the defendant, see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C) (\u201cServing a summons . . . estab-\nlishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant . . . when au-\nthorized by a federal statute\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a) \n(providing for nationwide service of process and venue); \nand (2) the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts \nwith the United States as a whole to satisfy a traditional \ndue process analysis. See Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian \nAuth., 153 F. Supp. 2d 76, 87, 95 (D.R.I. 2001); see also In \nre Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F. Supp. \n2d 539, 556-58 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. \n& Dev. Corp., 349 F. Supp. 2d 765, 806-07 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); \nBiton v. Palestinian Interim Self-Gov\u2019t Auth., 310 F. \nSupp. 2d 172, 179 (D.D.C. 2004).  \nHere, Defendants do not assert that service was de-\nfective. Defendants do not even dispute that, during the \n \n4 Plaintiffs have not provided an exhaustive list of the facts that they \nbelieve confer jurisdiction over the Defendants. However, Plaintiffs \nhave provided all of the materials submitted in Estates of Ungar v. \nPalestinian Auth., 325 F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.R.I. 2004), as well as addi-\ntional materials relevant to post-2002 activities. \n\n190a \n \n \nrelevant time period, they maintained sufficient contacts \nwith the United States to satisfy the traditional due pro-\ncess analysis for general jurisdiction. Rather, Defendants \ncontend that their contacts with the United States qualify \nas jurisdictional exceptions and may not be relied upon to \nsupport the exercise of general jurisdiction over them. \nThey contend that any remaining contacts are insubstan-\ntial. \nA.  SERVICE \nPlaintiffs\u2019 properly served the PLO and the PLA. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B) provides that a foreign associa-\ntion \u201cmust be served[] . . . in a judicial district of the United \nStates . . . by delivering a copy of the summons and of the \ncomplaint to an officer, a managing or general agent.\u201d \nHere, Plaintiffs personally served Hassan Abdel Rahman \nat his home in Virginia. See Pls.\u2019 Opposition Memo, Ex. B \n(\u201cAffidavit of Service\u201d). Rahman, based upon the over-\nwhelming competent evidence produced by Plaintiffs,5 was \nthe Chief Representative of the PLO and the PA in the \nUnited States at the time of service. Rahman was thus a \nvalid agent for service of process on the PLO and the PA.6 \n \n5 See Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., Exs. C (business card identifying him as \n\u201cChief Representative\u201d to the \u201cPalestine Liberation Organization\u201d \nand the \u201cPalestine National Authority\u201d), D (letter written by him to \nCongressman Abercrombie in which he identifies himself as \u201cChief \nRepresentative of the PLO and PNA\u201d), E (letter sent to him by Rich-\nard C. Massey of the United States Department of State identifying \nhim as \u201cChief Representative PLO & PNA), M (10/30/2003 Senate \nHearing Transcript identifying Rahman as \u201cchief representative of \nthe PLO and the PA in the United States\u201d at 13 and speaking on behalf \nof \u201c[w]e, the Palestinian Authority\u201d at 28); see also Declaration of Da-\nvid J. Strachman, Ex. 1 (reproducing evidence of Rahman\u2019s dual \nagency from Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 55-59). \n6 This finding is consistent with other federal courts. See, e.g., \nKliman v. Palestine Authority, 547 F.Supp.2d 8, 13-14 (D.D.C. 2008) \n\n191a \n \n \nB.  SERVICE \nTo determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction \ncomports with due process, the Court must engage in a \ntwo part analysis: \u201cthe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 inquiry and the \n\u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry.\u201d Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly \nHills. LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 171 (2d Cir. 2010). The court \nmust first determine whether a defendant has minimum \ncontacts with the forum such that maintenance of the ac-\ntion does not offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice. See State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan Repub-\nlic v. Frontera, 582 F.3d 393, 396 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation \nomitted). The court must then determine whether it would \nbe reasonable, under the circumstances of the particular \ncase, to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. See \nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, \n568 (2d Cir. 1996). \n1.  Minimum Contacts7 \nThe minimal contacts inquiry necessitates \u201ca distinc-\ntion . . . between \u2018specific\u2019 jurisdiction and \u2018general\u2019 juris-\ndiction.\u201d Chloe, 616 F.3d at 165. Whereas specific \n \n(considering Haman\u2019s successor); Ungar, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 55-59 \n(considering Haman); Biton, 310 F. Supp. 2d at 179-190 (same). \n7 This Court conducts a de novo review of the minimal contacts of the \nPLO and the PA. Upon first considering the issue of personal juris-\ndiction in the above-captioned action, this Court recognized that \u201c[a] \nnumber of federal courts [had already] concluded that both the PA \nand PLO have sufficient minimum contacts with the United States to \njustify the exercise of personal jurisdiction under the Due Process \nClause.\u201d Sololow, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 460 (citations omitted). This \nCourt, nevertheless, held that \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction must be deter-\nmined on a case-by-case basis because it is dependent upon the de-\nfendants\u2019 contacts with the [United States] at the time the lawsuit was \ncommenced.\u201d Id. at 460. This Court thus declined to entertain Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 arguments that the principles of collateral estoppel and/or the \npresumption of continuity preclude or otherwise limit Defendants\u2019 lit-\nigation of the personal jurisdiction issue. \n\n192a \n \n \njurisdiction applies where a defendant\u2019s contacts are re-\nlated to the litigation, general jurisdiction applies where \nthey are unrelated, and involves a more stringent minimal \ncontacts test. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia., \nS.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, 415 n.9; see also Metro Life, \n84 F.3d at 568. General jurisdiction requires that each8 de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the forum are continuous and sys-\ntematic. Id. In determining the strength of those contacts, \nthe court is to examine the totality of the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts with the forum over a period of time that is reasona-\nble under the circumstances, up to and including the date \nthe suit was filed.9 See Chloe, 616 F.3d at 164; Porina v. \nMarward Shipping Co., 521 F.3d 122, 128 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(citation omitted). Additionally, the defendant must be \nfound to have purposely availed himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities in the forum. See Hanson v. Denckla, \n357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). \na.  Traditional Jurisdictional Analysis \nAfter carefully reviewing the competent evidence pro-\nduced, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have gone beyond \nthe allegations in the Amended Complaint to demonstrate \nby a preponderance of the evidence that the PLO and the \nPA purposely engaged in numerous activities that re-\nsulted in both entities having a continuous and systematic \n \n8 \u201cEach defendant\u2019s contacts with the [United States] must be as-\nsessed individually,\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction cannot be implied or imputed \nfrom one defendant to another.\u201d Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., \n465 U.S. 770, 781 n.13 (1984); Langenberg v. Sofair, 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 65276, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2006); see also Rush v. \nSavchuk, 444 U.S. 320, 331-32 (1980). \n9 For the purpose of discovery, the parties agreed that the relevant \ntime period was the six-year period preceding the filing of the com-\nplaint, i.e. January 16, 1998, to January 16, 2004. See Pls. Opp. Mem., \nat 5; Defs. Opening Mem., at 7-8. Such periods have been found to be \nreasonable by the Second Circuit. See Metro Life, 84 F.3d at 569-70 \n(collecting cases). \n\n193a \n \n \npresence within the United States. Therefore, this Court \nagrees with every federal court to have considered the is-\nsue that the totality of activities in the United States by \nthe PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of general per-\nsonal jurisdiction.10 \nIt is undisputed that the PLO maintained an office in \nWashington, D.C., during the relevant period. See Defs.\u2019 \nOpening Mem., at 8-9; Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., at 10; see also \nStrachman Declaration, Ex. 1 Part 5 (\u201cRevised Notice\u201d), \nEx.

See id., Ex. 3, at 9. \nThe parties disagree over whether the PA maintained \nan office in Washington, D.C.; however the weight of the \nevidence indicates that the D.C. office simultaneously \nserved as an office for the PLO and the PA.12 The initial \nregistration statement states that \u201c[t]he PLO offices in \nWashington, D.C. shall represent the PLO and the Pales-\ntinian Authority in the United States\u201d and that \u201c[t]he PLO \nand the Palestinian Authority will pay for the expenses of \nthe office and salaries of its employees.\u201d Strachman Dec-\nlaration, Ex. 1 Part 5, Ex. KK. Rahman, the Chief Repre-\nsentative of the PLO and the PA, used and was contacted \nat a single address \u2013 that of the D.C. office. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. \nMem., Exs. C-E. The PA entered into a substantial com-\nmercial contract that repeatedly described the D.C. office \nas an office of the PA. See id., F (retainer agreement for \n1999-2002). Finally, the PA\u2019s Ministry of Finance \u2013 rather \nthan the PLO Headquarters in Gaza \u2013 provided the vast \n \n11 Defendants did not provide precise dates of employment. Constru-\ning all facts in a light favorable to Plaintiffs, the lack of duplication \namongst the titles and job descriptions of the PLO employees sug-\ngests that the majority of the twelve employees were present for the \nentirety of the relevant period. See Defs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, at 9. \n12 Defendants\u2019 argument that only the PLO had the authority to con-\nduct foreign affairs is unpersuasive. The fact that the PA should not \nhave been operating an office in the United States does not mean that \nit did not or could not have done so. Moreover, even if Defendants\u2019 are \nright, \u201cthere is nothing in the Oslo Accords . . . prohibit[ing] the PA \nfrom conducting other non-diplomatic activities (such as commercial, \npublic relations, lobbying, or educational activities) through its repre-\nsentatives, officers and agents abroad.\u201d Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 54. \nAlso the fact that only 2 of the 14 employees at the D.C. office were \nemployed by the PA does not demonstrate that D.C. office was not \nworking on behalf of the PA. See Defs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3 (Inter-\nrogatories), at 6, 10-11. \n\n195a \n \n \nmajority of the D.C. office\u2019s income. See Strachman Dec-\nlaration, Exs. 2-12. Accordingly, the activities of the D.C. \noffice are attributable to both the PLO and the PA.13 \nThe Defendants, through the D.C. office, had a sub-\nstantial commercial presence in the United States. The \nDefendants operated a fully and continuously functional \noffice in Washington, D.C., during the relevant period. De-\nfendants had thirty-five land line telephone and cell phone \nnumbers and two bank accounts from 2002-2004.14 See \nDefs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, at 20-22. The Defendants had \na CD account as late as January 2003. Id., Ex. 3, at 20. De-\nfendants also had ongoing commercial contracts and \ntransactions with numerous U.S.-based businesses, in-\ncluding for office supplies and equipment, postage/ship-\nping, new services/subscriptions, telecommunications/in-\nternet, IT support, accountant and legal services, and \ncredit cards. See id., Ex. 4 (\u201cDocument Requests\u201d), at 9-\n10. Defendants even paid for certain living expenses of \nRahman. See id., Ex. 4, at 10. \nFurthermore, the PA retained a consulting and lobby-\ning firm through a multi-year, multimillion dollar contract. \nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., Ex. F. That contract resulted in the \nperformance of services from November 1999 to at least \nApril 2004. See id., Ex G.

Based upon required disclosures to \nfederal authorities, the D.C. office engaged in extensive \npublic relations activities throughout the United States, \nranging from interviews and speeches to attending and \nparticipating in various public events.

See id., Exs. \n2-12; see also Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 4950 (summarizing \nthe millions of dollars spend on media and public relations \nactivities from 1999-2001). Rahman, the Chief Repre-\nsentative of the PLO and the PA in the United States, par-\nticipated in at least 158 public interviews and media ap-\npearances between January 1998 and January 2004.18 See \nStachman Declaration \u00b6 18 (listing events); id., Ex. 13 \n(providing transcripts). Most were broadcasted on major \nnational news networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, \nABC, and MSNBC. \nc.  \nJurisdictional Exceptions \nCertain activities fall under jurisdictional exceptions \nand may not be properly considered as a basis of jurisdic-\ntion. See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-\nGestione, 937 F.2d 44, 51 n.7 (2d Cir. 1991) (noting exam-\nples). However, there is not a presumption that a jurisdic-\ntional exception applies where a dispute exists over ex-\ncluding particular contacts. A plaintiff is not required to \ndisprove the applicability of a jurisdictional exception \nsimply because one is asserted by a defendant. A \n \n17 Approximate total are as follows: 14 events in the six month period \nending September 1998. See Strachman Declaration, Ex. 2. 13 events \nin the six month period ending March 1999. Id., Ex. 3. 20 events in the \nsix month period ending September 1999. Id., Ex. 4. 15 events in the \nsix month period ending March 2000.

Unsupported allegations and assertions are \nsimply insufficient after the parties have engaged in juris-\ndictional discovery. \nWith respect to foreign entities such as the PLO and \nthe PA engaging in activities in the United States, two ex-\nceptions may be applicable. First, jurisdiction in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia over a person or entity may not be \ngrounded on the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontacts with a federal in-\nstrumentality,\u201d including where contacts only consist of \n\u201clobbying activity before federal agencies to secure their \nown proprietary interests.\u201d Bechtel & Cole v. Graceland \nBroadcasting, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 4468, at *3 (D.C. \nCir. Mar. 9, 1994) (citing Environmental Research Intl, \nInc. v.

Silver, 394 A.2d 1368, 1373- \n74 (D.C. 1978))).19 The \u201cgovernment contacts\u201d exception \ndoes not apply where the defendant is engaged in substan-\ntial activity beyond lobbying the federal government. \nThe Second Circuit has also held that participation in \nthe United Nation\u2019s affairs by a \u201cforeign organization\u201d \nmay not properly be considered as a basis of jurisdiction \nin New York. See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51-52. With re-\nspect to the PLO\u2019s New York office, the parties have pro-\nduced little evidence, but no factual dispute appears to ex-\nist. The PLO operated and owned an office in New York \n \n19 See also Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51 (noting that the government \ncontacts exception covers non-resident\u2019s \u201cgetting information from or \ngiving information to the government, or getting the government\u2019s \npermission to do something.\u201d) (quoting Investment Co. Inst. v. United \nStates, 550 F.

See Dfs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, \nat 19-20. The PLO employed twenty employees at the New \nYork office for all or a portion of the relevant period, and \nthe PA employed one. Id., Ex. 3, at 6. The New York office \nhad a checking account and at least two telephone lines. \nId., Ex. 3, at 20, 22. Finally, Nasser Al-Kidwa, the ambas-\nsador during the relevant period, participated on behalf of \nthe PLO in at least 73 media appearances and interviews \nbetween 2000 and 2003 on a mix of major national news \nnetworks and local stations. See Strachman Declaration \u00b6 \n20 (listing events); id., Ex. 14 (transcripts). \nDefendants assert that none of the contacts associ-\nated with the D.C. and New York offices can be considered \nfor purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction pursuant \nto the aforementioned exceptions. Defendants do not, \nhowever, provide any evidence demonstrating that either \noffice exclusively and solely dealt with the federal govern-\nment or the UN. Nor have Defendants made an effort to \ndemonstrate that their activities in Washington, D.C., and \nNew York were commensurate with their special diplo-\nmatic need for being present in those cities. See, e.g., Fan-\ndel v. Arabian American Oil Co., 345 F.2d 87, 89 (D.C. Cir. \n1965). With respect to the activities involving the New \nYork office, Defendants are entitled to the Klinghoffer ju-\nrisdictional exception. Plaintiffs have failed to identify any \ncontacts that raise a dispute over the exclusivity of the ac-\ntivities conducted from the New York office, and, in any \nevent, the evidence indicates that the activities were pri-\nmarily related to the PLO\u2019s UN affairs. \nWith respect to the activities involving the D.C. office, \nDefendants have failed to demonstrate by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that any of the contacts should be ex-\ncluded by either jurisdictional exception. The Klinghoffer \njurisdictional exception is inapplicable because there is no \n\n200a \n \n \nevidence that the D.C.-based activities involved UN af-\nfairs,20 and because the exception does not provide for a \nblanket immunization of all contacts in the United States. \nDefendants have failed to demonstrate by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that their activities from the Wash-\nington, D.C. office exclusively involved contacting some \nbranch of the federal government. Outside of New York, \nDefendants are no different than any other political organ-\nization based in Washington, D.C.,21 and yet the record \ncontains overwhelming evidence that Defendants were \nprimarily in Washington, D.C. pursuing their political in-\nterest, but were not solely conducting diplomatic activities \nwith our government. \nNevertheless, even after excluding activities con-\nducted in furtherance of the PLO\u2019s observer status and \ncontacts with the federal government, the remaining \n \n20 Defendants never assert that they were conducting UN affairs \nfrom the D.C. office. In fact, the evidence \u2013 namely, the deposition tes-\ntimony of Said M. Hamad, Deputy Chief in the D.C. office \u2013 indicates \nthat they had no involvement with UN activities.  \nQ: And the office in New York, are you involved with that office at \nall? Do you communicate with them?  \nA No.; \nQ Why is that?  \nA Because they have their own business at U.N. Q And you don\u2019t \ncoordinate any activities?  \nA Well, there\u2019s no activities to coordinate. They have their own \nbusiness. Their mission is the United States. We have nothing to do \nwith them, they have nothing to do with us, except hello and all.  \nSee Strachman Declaration, Ex. N, at 31. \n21 Palestine, as discussed in this Court\u2019s 9/30/2008 Memorandum De-\ncision and Order, is not recognized, under United States law, as a \u2018for-\neign state.\u2019\u201d Sokolow, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 458. \u201c[D]efendants cannot \nderivatively secure sovereign immunity as agencies and/or instrumen-\ntalities of Palestine,\u201d and \u201cthe PA is [not] . . . entitled to immunity as \na political subdivision of Israel.\u201d Id. \n\n201a \n \n \ncontacts would still provide a sufficient basis to exercise \ngeneral jurisdiction over the Defendants. See, e.g., Unger, \n325 F. Supp. 2d at 53; see also Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro Ed Altri-Gestione etc., 795 F. Supp. 112, 114 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1992). The PLO and the PA were continuously \nand systematically present in the United States by virtue \nof their extensive public relations activities. Whether char-\nacterized as diplomatic public-speaking or proselytizing, \nthe forums and audiences clearly indicate that the vast \nmajority of these appearances were not directly communi-\ncating to or sponsored by the federal government or the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. These appearances \nwere separate from Defendants\u2019 diplomatic foreign affairs \nfunctions in the United States, such as the PLO\u2019s right to \nspeak at the United Nations General Assembly meetings, \nor the PLO or the PA\u2019s efforts to petition the United \nStates government. This alone is a sufficient basis to de-\ncline to ignore the entire physical presence, commercial \ntransactions, and other activities of the D.C. office. Thus, \nas found in Unger, \u201ceven if the court excludes from its con-\nsideration contacts by the Washington Office of the PLO \nwith the federal government [or by the New York office \nwith the UN], the other activities of that office are suffi-\ncient to allow this court to find minimum contacts.\u201d 325 F. \nSupp. 2d at 53; see also Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro Ed Altri-Gestione, 795 F. Supp. 112, 114 (S.D.N.Y. \n1992). \n3. \nReasonableness \nThe second part of the jurisdictional analysis asks \n\u201cwhether the assertion of personal jurisdiction comports \nwith \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice\u2019 \u2013 that is, whether it is reasonable under the circum-\nstances of the particular case.\u201d Metro. Life, 84 F.3d at 568 \n(quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, \n90 L. Ed. 95, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945)). Where a plaintiff makes \nthe threshold showing of the minimum contacts required \n\n202a \n \n \nto meet the first test, a defendant must present \u201ca compel-\nling case that the presence of some other considerations \nwould render jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d Id. (quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 477). Courts are to consider five \nfactors in evaluating reasonableness: \u201c(1) the burden that \nthe exercise of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant; \n(2) the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the \ncase; (3) the plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining convenient and \neffective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system\u2019s interest \nin obtaining the most efficient resolution of the contro-\nversy; and (5) the shared interest of the states in further-\ning substantive social policies.\u201d Id. at 568 (citing Asahi \nMetal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113-14 \n(1987); Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476-47)).  \nHere, neither the PLO nor the PA has presented a \ncompelling case that exercising jurisdiction over them in \nthe present action will offend the Constitution or federal \nlaw. The reality is that ATA litigation often involves for-\neign individuals and entities, and thereby, a statutory \ncause of action for international terrorism exists. There is \na strong inherent interest of the United States and Plain-\ntiffs in litigating ATA claims in the United States. The De-\nfendants have not demonstrated that this case would im-\npose a more significant burden than can typically be ex-\npected, particularly in light of the fact that they have vig-\norously engaged in such litigation several times before. \nThe Defendants have also failed to identify an alternative \nforum where Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could be brought, and \nwhere the foreign court could grant a substantially similar \nremedy. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of personal ju-\nrisdiction is DENIED.  \n\n203a \n \n \n \nDated:  New York, New York  \n \nMarch 30, 2011 \nSO ORDERED. \n George B.

Following disposition of the appeals in these \ncases on September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs- Appellants and In-\ntervenor-Appellant filed petitions for rehearing en banc \nand an active judge of the Court thereafter requested a \npoll on whether to rehear the case en banc. A poll having \nbeen conducted and there being no majority favoring en \nbanc review, the petition for rehearing en banc is hereby \nDENIED. \nJoseph F. Bianco, Circuit Judge, concurs by opinion in \nthe denial of rehearing en banc. \nSteven J. Menashi, Circuit Judge, joined by Debra \nAnn Livingston, Chief Judge, Michael H. Park, Circuit \nJudge, and joined in Part I by Richard J. Sullivan, Circuit \nJudge, dissents by opinion from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc. \nPierre N. Leval, Circuit Judge, filed a statement with \nrespect to the denial of rehearing en banc. \nAlison J. Nathan, Circuit Judge, took no part in the \nconsideration or decision of the petition. \nFOR THE COURT: \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk \n \n \n\n209a \n \n \nJOSEPH F. BIANCO, Circuit Judge, concurring in the or-\nder denying rehearing en banc: \nI concur in the denial of the petition for rehearing en \nbanc and, as a member of the unanimous panel issuing the \nopinions that are the subject of the petition, write to ex-\nplain my disagreement with the views expressed by the \ndissent. \nAs discussed in the panel opinions in these cases, and \ndiscussed in greater detail below, although these appeals \ninvolved the question of personal jurisdiction in the context \nof a novel statutory structure, the analysis in both opinions \nfollowed clear precedent from the Supreme Court and did \nnot articulate any new legal rule. In contrast, the dissent \nproposes a new rule of \u201cdeemed consent\u201d or \u201cconstructive \nconsent\u201d for purposes of personal jurisdiction, which has \nnever been recognized by the Supreme Court nor by any \nother court and is fundamentally incompatible with exist-\ning precedent for determining consent to waive a constitu-\ntional right. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s proposed holding that \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not \nlimit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts \nin the same way as the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment is not only contrary to our well-settled \nprecedent, but also has been rejected by each of the other \nsix sister circuits who has addressed that issue. There is \nno persuasive reason to depart from the principles of stare \ndecisis and create a new rule that could have far-reaching \nramifications for the entire body of personal jurisdiction \njurisprudence beyond these two particular cases. \nThe principle that a court must have personal jurisdic-\ntion over a defendant \u201crecognizes and protects an individ-\nual liberty interest\u201d flowing from the Constitution\u2019s guar-\nantees of due process. Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des \nBauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982). The \n\n210a \n \n \nSupreme Court has recognized three bases for exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over an out-of-forum defendant in ac-\ncordance with the dictates of due process: general juris-\ndiction, specific jurisdiction, and consent. See, e.g., Burger \nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472\u201373 (1985). \nConsent to personal jurisdiction is a voluntary agreement \non the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular forum. \nSee Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, \n316 (1964); J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 880\u201381 (2011) (plurality opinion). \nThe plaintiffs in these cases relied on a theory of \ndeemed consent or constructive consent to justify personal \njurisdiction in federal court. More particularly, the plain-\ntiffs in these cases are the victims or relatives of victims of \nterrorist attacks in the West Bank or Israel. They sued \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the \nPalestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d), seeking damages for alleged \nviolations of the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333, related to those attacks. In both cases, it was un-\ndisputed that the district court did not have general juris-\ndiction over the PLO and the PA because those organiza-\ntions were not \u201cat home\u201d in the United States. It was also \nundisputed that there was no specific jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA because the activities at issue occurred \nabroad and were random acts of terror, rather than acts \ndirected against United States citizens. \nThe only asserted basis for personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA was the Promoting Security and Jus-\ntice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), in \nwhich Congress provided that the PLO and the PA \u201cshall \nbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in \nany civil ATA action upon engaging in certain forms of \npost-enactment conduct, namely (1) making payments, di-\nrectly or indirectly, to the designees or families of \n\n211a \n \n \nincarcerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, whose \nacts of terror injured or killed a United States national, or \n(2) undertaking any activities within the United States, \nsubject to a handful of exceptions. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1). These activities within the United States re-\nmained unlawful, but Congress made them a basis for per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA. \nIn both Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization, \n578 F. Supp. 3d 577, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2022), and Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Organization, 590 F. Supp. 3d 589, \n595\u201397 (S.D.N.Y. 2022), the district courts held that the \nPSJVTA was unconstitutional because it was not a valid \nbasis for finding that the PLO and the PA had consented \nto personal jurisdiction in a federal court. In both cases, \nthis Court agreed. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n82 F.4th 74, 97\u201398 (2d Cir. 2023) (\u201cFuld\u201d); Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 82 F.4th 64, 73\u201374 (2d Cir. \n2023) (\u201cWaldman III\u201d), aff\u2019g Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d 589. \nThereafter, a majority of the active judges of this Court \nvoted to deny the petition for rehearing en banc. \nThe purpose of this concurrence is not to reprise all of \nthe arguments and analyses in Fuld and Waldman III. \nThose unanimous decisions explain at length the history of \nthese cases and why the PSJVTA is unconstitutional. In-\nstead, the purpose of this concurrence is to respond to the \ncriticisms raised in the dissent from the denial of rehear-\ning en banc. The dissent contends that the panel\u2019s deci-\nsions in Fuld and Waldman III erred in three ways: (1) \nby imposing a new requirement that consent to personal \njurisdiction must be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d; (2) by \nfailing to find that the alleged unlawful activities of the \nPLO and the PA are a basis to find they had consented to \ncivil jurisdiction in United States courts; and (3) by holding \nthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n\n212a \n \n \nimposes the same limits on personal jurisdiction as the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ex-\ncept that the minimum contacts under the Fourteenth \nAmendment must be with a state and the minimum con-\ntacts under the Fifth Amendment are with the nation. I re-\nspectfully disagree with these arguments and will address \nthem in turn. \nI. \nAs an initial matter, the dissent contends that the gov-\nernment could simply recognize the PA as a state and \nthereby eliminate its constitutional rights. See post, \nMenashi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, \nat 10. However, we addressed that issue in Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Organization, 835 F.3d 317, 329 (2d \nCir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. Sokolow \nv. Palestine Liberation Org., 584 U.S. 915 (2018), explain-\ning that if the government were to recognize the PA or the \nPLO as a state, they would receive the protection of sover-\neign immunity. These cases would then have to be consid-\nered under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \n(\u201cFSIA\u201d). See id. Moreover, as discussed in Waldman I \nand in Fuld, the Oslo Accords limit the PA\u2019s authority to \nparts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for that reason, \nthe PLO conducts foreign affairs. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at \n322\u201323; see also Fuld, 82 F.4th at 80. Neither the PA nor \nthe PLO is a sovereign government, and there is no dis-\npute that they are entitled to constitutional due process. \nSee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 329. \nTurning to the merits, the dissent argues that \u201cthe \npanel incorrectly held that Congress may deem a foreign \nentity to have consented to personal jurisdiction based on \nits conduct only if the foreign entity receives a reciprocal \nbenefit.\u201d Post at 2. However, Fuld created no such re-\nquirement. Instead, Fuld described in detail numerous \n\n213a \n \n \ncircumstances that the Supreme Court found \u201cmani-\nfested\u201d consent\u2014 including \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d but also \n\u201clitigation-related activities\u201d and others\u2014 and found that \nthe PSJVTA did not satisfy any of these circumstances. \nSee 82 F.4th at 88\u201390 (citing, inter alia, Mallory v. Norfolk \nS. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023)). Fuld then distinguished \nMallory and other cases involving business registration \nstatutes on the ground that such statutes, unlike the \nPSJVTA, involved reciprocal bargains, but Fuld did not \nsay that consent to jurisdiction can only be found if there \nis a reciprocal bargain. See 82 F.4th at 94\u201396. \nMoreover, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the \nfacts in Mallory offer no support for the deemed consent \nprovision of the PSJVTA. The PLO and the PA never reg-\nistered to do business in the United States and received \nno benefit for such an action. Congress simply declared \nthat continuing to make certain payments outside the \nUnited States and conducting certain activities in the \nUnited States that were otherwise illegal were sufficient \nto deem the PLO and the PA to have consented to juris-\ndiction in United States courts. Nothing in Mallory sup-\nports that contention. \nRelying primarily on language in plurality opinions in \nMallory, the dissent extrapolates a general principle that \n\u201cdeemed consent statutes are consistent with the Consti-\ntution\u201d and that the \u201cconsent of the foreign entity must only \nbe knowing and voluntary and involve some nexus to the \nforum such that requiring consent would not be \u2018unfair.\u2019\u201d \nPost at 15\u201316 (citing Mallory, 600 U.S. at 141 (plurality \nopinion); id. at 153\u201354 (Alito, J., concurring)). However, \nthat formulation overlooks that the railway company in \nMallory had registered to do business in Pennsylvania \nand, as a condition of doing business, had thereby \n\n214a \n \n \nconsented to jurisdiction to be sued in the state. Justice \nAlito\u2019s concurrence framed the question as follows: \nThe sole question before us is whether the Due Pro-\ncess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is vio-\nlated when a large out-of-state corporation with \nsubstantial operations in a State complies with a \nregistration requirement that conditions the right \nto do business in that State on the registrant\u2019s sub-\nmission to personal jurisdiction in any suits that are \nbrought there. \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 150. Justice Alito concluded that the \nDue Process Clause was not violated by requiring the rail-\nway to be subjected to suit in Pennsylvania, explaining: \nRequiring Norfolk Southern to defend against Mal-\nlory\u2019s suit in Pennsylvania . . . is not so deeply unfair \nthat it violates the railroad\u2019s constitutional right to \ndue process. The company has extensive operations \nin Pennsylvania; has availed itself of the Pennsyl-\nvania courts on countless occasions; and had clear \nnotice that Pennsylvania considered its registration \nas consent to general jurisdiction. Norfolk South-\nern\u2019s conduct and connection with Pennsylvania are \nsuch that it should reasonably anticipate being \nhaled into court there. \nId. at 153 (alterations adopted) (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted). Thus, the business registration \nstatute at issue in Mallory bears no reasonable resem-\nblance to the deemed consent provisions of the PSJVTA. \nThe dissent asserts that the panel opinions impose ad-\nditional requirements beyond that required by principles \nof fundamental fairness, highlighting language in the dis-\ntrict court opinion in Fuld that \u201c[d]efendants do not cite, \nand the Court has not found, any case holding that . . . re-\nceipt of a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Post at 17 \n\n215a \n \n \n(quoting Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 595 n.10). Like the dis-\ntrict court, the panel did not adopt the defendants\u2019 argu-\nment that the receipt of a benefit is a necessary condition \nfor consent. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 96 n.13; Fuld, 578 F. \nSupp. 3d at 595 n.10. Instead, this Court noted that an ex-\nchange of benefits was an important part of the justifica-\ntion for the consent to jurisdiction in business registration \nstatutes, such as the statute at issue in Mallory, but was \nnot required in all cases of consent. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at \n96 n.13 (\u201cThe receipt of a benefit from the forum is not a \nnecessary prerequisite to a finding that a defendant has \nconsented to personal jurisdiction there. . . . There are \nother means of demonstrating consent, such as certain lit-\nigation-related conduct.\u201d). The district court ultimately \nrejected the constitutionality of the PSJVTA for reasons \nsimilar to those discussed by the panel: \nIn the final analysis, the Court cannot acquiesce in \nCongress\u2019s legislative sleight of hand and exercise \njurisdiction over Defendants here pursuant to the \nPSJVTA. A defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary \nconsent is a valid basis to subject it to the jurisdic-\ntion of a court, but Congress cannot simply declare \nanything it wants to be consent. To hold otherwise \nwould let fiction get the better of fact and make a \nmockery of the Due Process Clause. . . . For today\u2019s \npurposes, it suffices to say that the provisions of the \nPSJVTA at issue push the concept of consent well \nbeyond its breaking point and that the predicate \nconduct alleged here is not \u201cof such a nature as to \njustify the fiction\u201d of consent. It follows that exer-\ncising jurisdiction under the facts of this case does \nnot comport with due process . . . . \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 595 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945)). \n\n216a \n \n \nThe dissent replaces the carefully balanced legal land-\nscape of constitutional due process with a new standard, \nclaiming that \u201cthe Supreme Court has made clear[] [that] \nconsent based on conduct need only be knowing and vol-\nuntary and have a nexus to the forum.\u201d Post at 3. Mallory, \nhowever, did not establish such a test and does not even \nuse the term \u201cnexus.\u201d Nor does any other Supreme Court \ndecision impute consent to jurisdiction based simply on an \nundefined nexus to the forum. Cf., Ins. Corp. of Ir., 456 \nU.S. at 704; Pa. Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & 22 \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 94\u201395 (1917). Instead, the dissent \nappears to use the word \u201cnexus\u201d as an umbrella term for \nany activity that Congress might declare subjects a de-\nfendant to the jurisdiction of United States courts. In so \nreasoning, the dissent substitutes the well-established re-\nquirement that consent be knowing and voluntary with the \nconcept that all that is necessary is that a person\u2019s conduct \nbe knowing and voluntary, and that the conduct have some \nrelation to the forum, irrespective of whether the conduct \nreflects consent to jurisdiction in the forum. Adopting the \ndissent\u2019s interpretation would allow the government to de-\nclare conduct to be consent, even if that conduct could not \nreasonably be considered to be consent. Indeed, the dis-\nsent\u2019s new test would allow Congress to subject any for-\neign entity to personal jurisdiction in the United States, \neven in the absence of any contacts with the United States, \nif that entity knowingly and voluntarily engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction in the United States courts. \nThe dissent\u2019s test is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s \nadmonition against the \u201cdeemed waiver\u201d of constitutional \nrights in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Post-\nsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). \n\n217a \n \n \nIn that case, the question presented was whether the \nTrademark Remedy Clarification Act (\u201cTRCA\u201d), 106 Stat. \n3567, subjects states to suits brought under Section 43(a) \nof the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). See Coll. Sav. \nBank, 527 U.S. at 668\u201369. Like the PSJVTA, the TRCA \npurported to identify conduct that the targeted actors\u2014\nthe states\u2014could \u201cchoose to abandon.\u201d See id. at 684. The \nstates were then deemed to have \u201cconstructively waived\u201d \ntheir sovereign immunity by engaging in those specified \nactivities. See id. at 683\u201384. The Supreme Court held that \nCongress could not extract \u201cconstructive waivers\u201d of state \nsovereign immunity in this manner, see id. at 683, and that \nsovereign immunity was not abrogated or waived by a \nstate\u2019s participation in interstate commerce, see id. at 691. \nIn College Savings Bank, the Supreme Court did not \nlimit its analysis to issues of sovereign immunity. See \nFuld, 82 F.4th at 99 (citing Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681\u201382). To the contrary, Justice Scalia, writing for the \nmajority, analogized the Eleventh Amendment privilege \nof state sovereign immunity to the Sixth Amendment right \nto trial by jury in criminal cases\u2014concluding that the prin-\nciple of \u201cconstructive waiver\u201d would not apply in either cir-\ncumstance, and that constructive waivers \u201care simply un-\nheard of\u201d in the context of other constitutionally protected \nprivileges. See Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681\u201382. In ad-\ndition, because \u201c\u2018courts indulge every reasonable pre-\nsumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional \nrights,\u201d id. at 682 (alteration omitted) (quoting Aetna Ins. \nCo. v. Kennedy ex rel. Bogash, 301 U.S. 389, 393 (1937)), \nthe Supreme Court concluded that the waiver of state sov-\nereign immunity could not be implied, see id. (citing \nUnited States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)). \nThe PSJVTA\u2019s approach to deemed consent is likewise \n\u201cunheard of\u201d in the context of a waiver of the constitutional \n\n218a \n \n \nright to due process. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 100 (quoting \nColl. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681). Indeed, neither the dis-\nsent nor the plaintiffs in these cases have cited any case \ninvolving constructive or deemed consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction under circumstances similar to those in these ac-\ntions. \nThe dissent cites Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Com-\npany of Philadelphia, 243 U.S. 93 (1917), but that case, \nwhich Mallory found to be controlling, involved a Missouri \nbusiness registration statute, like the Pennsylvania busi-\nness registration statute at issue in Mallory. Justice Gor-\nsuch described Pennsylvania Fire as holding that: \u201cPenn-\nsylvania Fire could be sued in Missouri by an out-of-state \nplaintiff on an out- of-state contract because it had agreed \nto accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a \ncondition of doing business there.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n133 (citing Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at 95). There is no similar \nexchange of benefits in the PSJVTA. \nThe dissent attempts to justify the deemed consent \nprovision in this case as \u201csimply the adaptation of tag ju-\nrisdiction to artificial persons and works the same way.\u201d \nPost at 20. Tag jurisdiction recognizes the lawfulness of \njurisdiction based on the service of process on an individ-\nual physically present in the jurisdiction. See Burnham v. \nSuper. Ct. of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604, 610 \n(1990). The Supreme Court has accepted tag jurisdiction \nas a \u201ccontinuing tradition[] of our legal system,\u201d id. at 619, \nbut it is difficult to see that this analogy to tag jurisdiction \nis akin to or can form the basis for imputing the waiver of \na constitutional right. \nIn Burnham, the Supreme Court affirmed the consti-\ntutionality of tag jurisdiction as a \u201ctime-honored ap-\nproach,\u201d which \u201cdates back to the adoption of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 622. However, the Court then \n\n219a \n \n \nmade clear: \u201cFor new procedures, hitherto unknown, the \nDue Process Clause requires analysis to determine \nwhether \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice\u2019 have been offended.\u201d Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co., \n326 U.S. at 316). This Court in Waldman III and Fuld con-\nducted an analysis consistent with International Shoe, \nand for the reasons discussed at length in our opinions, \nconcluded that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for deemed con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction was inconsistent with the re-\nquirements of constitutional due process. See Waldman \nIII, 82 F.4th at 69. \nAs we explained in Fuld, in a civil case, \u201c[c]onsent to \npersonal jurisdiction is a voluntary agreement on the part \nof a defendant to proceed in a particular forum.\u201d 82 F.4th \nat 87. But neither basis for deemed consent in the PSJVTA \nreflects such an agreement. The first prong\u2014making pay-\nments outside the United States to the designees or fami-\nlies of incarcerated or deceased terrorists\u2014has nothing to \ndo with any alleged agreement by the PLO or the PA to \nbe sued in United States courts. Similarly, the second \nprong of the deemed consent provision\u2014conducting cer-\ntain activities in the United States\u2014does not reflect an \nagreement to be sued in United States courts. Indeed, the \nactivities that Congress described in the PSJVTA are un-\nlawful in the United States. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 93 n.10. \nAccordingly, for the reasons explained in Fuld, the \u201cdec-\nlaration of purported consent, predicated on conduct lack-\ning any of the indicia of valid consent previously recognized \nin the case law, fails to satisfy constitutional due process.\u201d \nId. at 91. \nII. \nThe dissent insists that it is \u201cstrange\u201d that the alleged \nconduct of the PLO and the PA in violation of federal re-\nstrictions would be an insufficient basis to find that they \n\n220a \n \n \nhad not received a benefit in the forum so as to confer ju-\nrisdiction. See post at 22. There is, however, nothing \n\u201cstrange\u201d about that result. Any office other than that \nmaintained pursuant to the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) Head-\nquarters Agreement is unlawful, see Fuld, 82 F.4th at 82 \nn.2, and so the defendants have not received any benefit \nfrom the forum, much less one \u201ceven greater\u201d than a for-\neign actor whose domestic activities are not restricted.1 \nPost at 22; see, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5203(a) (authorizing the \nAttorney General to take \u201cthe necessary steps\u201d\u2014 includ-\ning \u201cthe necessary legal action\u201d\u2014to enforce restrictions \nagainst the PLO). The dissent maintains that, in any \nevent, the Executive Branch has essentially conferred a \nbenefit onto the defendants by historically allowing cer-\ntain activities \u201cas a matter of grace.\u201d Post at 22 (quoting \n \n1 Although the dissent correctly notes that the defendants do not ar-\ngue on appeal that their offices and activities in the United States do \nnot meet the second statutory prong of the PSJVTA, it is important to \nemphasize that the failure to make that argument on appeal should not \nbe viewed as a concession by the defendants that they are engaged in \nany illegal conduct in the United States. Instead, as they explained, \nthe district court did not reach that issue. See Appellees\u2019 Fuld Br. at \n48 n.20; Appellees\u2019 Waldman Br. at 50 n.24. Moreover, the defendants \ndid argue below that their alleged activities in the United States are ex-\nempt from consideration under the PSJVTA as part of their UN mis-\nsion and UN- related activities, and \u201cany personal or official activities \nconducted ancillary\u201d thereto. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3); see also Fuld, 82 \nF.4th at 85 n.4. In particular, as explained in their appellate briefs, \nthe defendants argued in the district court that, \u201c[a]s part of its UN \nactivities, the Palestinian Mission participates in the work of the UN \nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestin-\nian People (\u2018CEIRPP\u2019). In light of the CEIRPP\u2019s work, the \u2018political \npropaganda activities and proselytizing,\u2019 press conferences, and Inter-\nnet and social media posts alleged in the Amended Complaint are all \nplainly either official UN business or \u2018ancillary to\u2019 such activities un-\nder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3).\u201d Appellees\u2019 Fuld Br. at 48 n.20 (citations \nomitted); see also Appellees\u2019 Waldman Br. at 50 n.24. \n\n221a \n \n \nFuld, 82 F. 4th 93 at n.10). As an initial matter, the dissent \ncites no case law to support the proposition that executive \nnonenforcement, the result of political considerations, \nshould impact the Court\u2019s constitutional due process anal-\nysis. Moreover, \u201cfederal law has long prohibited the de-\nfendants from engaging in any activities or maintaining \nany offices in the United States, absent specific executive \nor statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. \u201cThe PSJVTA \ndoes not purport to relax or override these prohibitions,\u201d \nand the parties did not identify \u201cany other change in exist-\ning law (for example, a statutory or executive waiver) that \nwould otherwise authorize the restricted conduct.\u201d2 Id. \nSo long as the PLO and the PA are prohibited from \nconducting business in the United States other than as al-\nlowed by the UN Headquarters Agreement, to establish \ndeemed consent to jurisdiction based on those activities is \nto use the denial of a due process right as a penalty for \nunlawful conduct. The Supreme Court has specifically \ncautioned against that result. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 94. In \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court held that a \ndiscovery sanction against the defendant establishing the \nfacts of jurisdiction did not violate due process because \nthere was a presumption that the evidence that was wrong-\nfully withheld established personal jurisdiction. 456 U.S. \nat 705\u201306. The Supreme Court made clear that \u201cthe per-\nsonal jurisdiction requirement recognizes and protects an \nindividual liberty interest.\u201d Id. at 702. The Supreme \nCourt found that it did not violate due process to invoke a \npresumption that the refusal to produce evidence material \n \n2 To the extent that the dissent suggests that specific jurisdiction \nmight lie where a nonresident defendant \u201charms\u201d the forum by engag-\ning in illicit activities in the forum, see post at 22, this suggestion has no \nbearing on the Court\u2019s analysis regarding the consent theory of juris-\ndiction, which is the only theory of jurisdiction being litigated in these \ncases. \n\n222a \n \n \nto the administration of due process was an admission of \nthe lack of merit of that defense. Id. at 705. However, the \nCourt distinguished that presumption from the situation \nin Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), in which the Court \nheld that it \u201cviolate[d] due process for a court to take simi-\nlar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey an order to \npay into the registry of the court a certain sum of money.\u201d \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 706. \nIn this case, establishing deemed-consent jurisdiction \nbased on the alleged unlawful activities undertaken by the \nPLO and the PA in the United States would be nothing \nmore than \u201cpunishment\u201d for such conduct.3 And nothing \nabout that conduct suggests that the PLO and the PA have \nconsented to be sued in United States courts. Instead, as \nwe explained in Fuld, \u201cthe [PSJVTA] subjects the defend-\nants to the authority of the federal courts for engaging in \nconduct with no connection to the establishment of per-\nsonal jurisdiction, and indeed with no connection to litiga-\ntion in the United States at all.\u201d 82 F.4th at 94. \n \n3 The dissent suggests that the second prong of the PSJVTA is not a \npenalty for unlawful conduct, but rather \u201csimply subjects each defend-\nant to the jurisdiction of the federal courts by virtue of its conduct in \nthe forum.\u201d Post at 24. However, it is uncontroverted that the alleged \nillegal conduct that would create jurisdiction under the second prong \nis wholly unrelated to the alleged activities giving rise to liability in \nthe underlying lawsuits. The dissent\u2019s analysis blurs the require-\nments for exercising personal jurisdiction through specific jurisdic-\ntion and the requirements for exercising personal jurisdiction through \nconsent. In the proceedings before the district court in Fuld, the \nplaintiffs never contended that the court had specific jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA. See 82 F.4th at 87. Moreover, this Court in \nWaldman I concluded that there was no specific jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA. See 835 F.3d at 335\u201337. The underlying acts of ter-\nrorism occurred outside the United States and were not targeted \nagainst United States nationals.  \n\n223a \n \n \nIn sum, under the consent theory of jurisdiction chosen \nby Congress, there is no principled way to deny the PLO \nand the PA the due process rights they have consistently \nasserted.4 \nIII. \nFinally, the dissent urges that the standard for deter-\nmining the constitutionality of exercising personal juris-\ndiction under the Fifth Amendment should not be the \nsame as under the Fourteenth Amendment. See post at \n26\u201334. Recognizing that the Supreme Court has \u201creserved \njudgment\u201d on this question, id. at 26 (citing Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017)), \nthe dissent contends that \u201cthe facts of these cases\u201d require \nthis Court to overturn its previous decisions, see id. at 35. \nAs we noted in Waldman I, for over forty years, this Court \nhas repeatedly held that there is a \u201ccongruence of due pro-\ncess analysis under both the Fourteenth and Fifth Amend-\nments,\u201d and \u201chas applied Fourteenth Amendment princi-\nples to Fifth Amendment civil terrorism cases.\u201d 835 F.3d \nat 330 (collecting cases). \nThe dissent seeks to overturn our well-established law \nbased on some scholarship to the effect that \u201coutside of the \nlimits imposed by service of process, a federal court\u2019s writ \nmay run as far as Congress, within its enumerated powers, \nwould have it go.\u201d Post at 28 (alteration adopted) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). However, the \n \n4 Although the dissent states that the \u201cconcurrence believes it would \nbe improper for Congress to punish the unlawful conduct of the PLO \nand the PA,\u201d post at 24, I reach no such conclusion, nor did the panel \nopinions. Instead, the panel opinions narrowly held that Congress \ncould not use this particular jurisdictional mechanism under these cir-\ncumstances to bypass the due process rights that otherwise exist in \nthis civil context. As discussed infra, many tools are available under \nthe broad powers of Congress to address alleged unlawful conduct of \nthis nature. \n\n224a \n \n \nscholarship cited in the dissent is insufficient to explain \nwhy actions in federal courts implicate individual liberty in-\nterests any less than those in state courts. As the Supreme \nCourt has emphasized: \nThe requirement that a court have personal juris-\ndiction flows not from Art. III, but from the Due \nProcess Clause. The personal jurisdiction require-\nment recognizes and protects an individual liberty \ninterest. It represents a restriction on judicial \npower not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a mat-\nter of individual liberty. \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 702. In my view, especially in \nthe absence of any intervening applicable Supreme Court \ndecision, the recent scholarship cited by the dissent does \nnot provide a sufficient basis, under principles of stare \ndecisis, to depart from a constitutional rule that has ex-\nisted in our Circuit for over forty years and has been re-\naffirmed numerous times without intervention by our en \nbanc Court. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 36 F.3d 106, \n110 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (en banc) (\u201c[B]ecause [our prece-\ndent] represents the established law of the circuit, a due \nregard for the value of stability in the law requires that we \nhave good and sufficient reason to reject it at this late \ndate.\u201d); Robert Bosch, LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp., 719 F.3d \n1305, 1316\u201317 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (en banc) (emphasizing the \nimportance of stare decisis when an en banc court consid-\ners adopting a position contrary to longstanding panel \nprecedent); United States v. Heredia, 483 F.3d 913, 918 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (\u201cOverturning a long-standing precedent is \nnever to be done lightly   \u201d); accord Al-Sharif v. U.S. \nCitizenship and Immig. Servs., 734 F.3d 207, 212 (3d Cir. \n2013) (en banc). \nIndeed, this Court\u2019s decisions, in both Waldman I and \nFuld, which followed clear and longstanding precedent \n\n225a \n \n \nfrom this Court, are consistent with the conclusion \nreached by each of the six other federal courts of appeals \nthat has addressed this specific question. Fuld, 82 F.4th \nat 103\u201304, 104 n.17 (collecting cases); Waldman I, 835 F.3d \nat 330; see also Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kai-\nsha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cBoth Due \nProcess Clauses use the same language and serve the \nsame purpose, protecting individual liberty by guarantee-\ning limits on personal jurisdiction.\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. \nDouglass v. Kaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023); Livnat v. Pal-\nestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 54\u201355 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (noting \nthat the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh, and Federal \nCircuits have expressly analyzed whether the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendment standards differ and \u201call agree \nthat there is no meaningful difference in the level of con-\ntacts required for personal jurisdiction\u201d). \nMoreover, it is unclear from the dissent whether the \nentire body of Fourteenth Amendment personal jurisdic-\ntion jurisprudence would be jettisoned in Fifth Amend-\nment cases, and if so, what would replace it. Would all de-\nfendants in federal courts, irrespective of the nature of the \nlawsuits against them, be denied the right to assert that \nhaling them into federal court is unreasonable? See \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472 (\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause \n\u2018gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that \nallows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that \nconduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. \n286, 297 (1980))). It is precisely this type of uncertainty \nthat the dissent\u2019s proposed approach would engender \nacross the personal jurisdiction landscape that strongly \ncounsels against en banc review to eliminate our \nlongstanding precedent in the absence of any intervening \nSupreme Court decision or guidance from the highest \n\n226a \n \n \ncourt in the land as to what the new constitutional param-\neters would be. \nFinally, the dissent suggests that our holding in these \ncases \u201cleaves Congress powerless to afford relief to Amer-\nican victims of international terrorism.\u201d Post at 38\u201339. I \nrespectfully disagree. In fact, the United States Depart-\nment of Justice, in opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to the \nSupreme Court for a writ of certiorari in Waldman I, also \ndisagreed with any such suggestion. More specifically, in \nthe certiorari petition, plaintiffs urged the Supreme Court \nto review our decision in Waldman I because, inter alia, \nthe application of Fourteenth Amendment personal- juris-\ndiction standards in cases governed by the Fifth Amend-\nment purportedly \u201cimperil[ed] Congress\u2019s ability to pro-\ntect Americans from international terrorism and other un-\nlawful acts abroad.\u201d Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 34, \nSokolow v.

The Department of Jus-\ntice, however, disagreed with that assessment and plain-\ntiffs\u2019 corresponding effort to overturn our approach to per-\nsonal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment (and that of \nsix of our sister circuits), explaining: \nIt is far from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 ap-\nproach will foreclose many claims that would other-\nwise go forward in federal courts. As the court of \nappeals explained, its approach permits U.S. courts \nto exercise jurisdiction over defendants accused of \ntargeting U.S. citizens in an act of international ter-\nrorism. It permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdic-\ntion if the United States was the focal point of the \nharm caused by the defendant\u2019s participation in or \nsupport for overseas terrorism.  And the court of \nappeals stated that it would permit U.S. courts to \nexercise jurisdiction over defendants alleged to \n\n227a \n \n \nhave purposefully availed themselves of the privi-\nlege of conducting activity in the United States, by, \nfor example, making use of U.S. financial institu-\ntions to support international terrorism. In addi-\ntion, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into ques-\ntion the United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defend-\nants under the broader due process principles the \ncourts have recognized in cases involving the appli-\ncation of U.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting \nU.S. citizens or interests. Under these circum-\nstances, in the absence of any conflict or even a de-\nveloped body of law addressing petitioners\u2019 rela-\ntively novel theory, this Court\u2019s intervention is not \nwarranted. \nBrief for the United States as Amicus Curiae at 17\u201318, \nSokolow v.

Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.)). \nBut it is equally true that it is the responsibility of federal \ncourts to enforce the Constitution, including when disfa-\nvored litigants are the target of government action. See \nNat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v.

At bottom, these appeals are not \nabout whether Congress has the constitutional and statu-\ntory authority to punish foreign entities who are engaged \nin alleged conduct that is illegal and/or contrary to the na-\ntional security interests of the United States, including \nthrough monetary sanctions, and to use such sanctions to \ncompensate victims of that conduct. Instead, the question \nis whether Congress can seek to accomplish those im-\nportant objectives through one particular jurisdictional \nmechanism\u2014namely, by attempting to twist the doctrine \nof deemed consent, for purposes of establishing personal \njurisdiction over foreign entities in civil cases, beyond \nrecognition under the current due process jurisprudence of \nthis Court and the Supreme Court. After careful consid-\neration, the unanimous decisions in Fuld and Waldman \nIII correctly recognized that \u201cCongress cannot, by legis-\nlative fiat, simply deem activities to be consent when the \nactivities themselves cannot plausibly be construed as \nsuch.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 97 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).

PLO \nMENASHI, Circuit Judge, joined by LIVINGSTON, \nChief Judge, and PARK, Circuit Judge, and joined as to \nPart I by SULLIVAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the \ndenial of rehearing en banc: \nThe panel in these cases invalidated a federal statute \nthat provides that when the Palestine Liberation Organi-\nzation (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d) en-\ngage in certain conduct\u2014 specifically (1) compensating \nterrorists who have killed or injured Americans or (2) \nmaintaining premises or engaging in official activities in \nthe United States\u2014those organizations are deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction in the federal \ncourts.1 The panel determined that it would be a violation \nof the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to sub-\nject the PLO and the PA to personal jurisdiction despite \nhaving engaged in such conduct, so the panel dismissed \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit. The plaintiffs had alleged pursuant \nto the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (\u201cATA\u201d) that the PLO \nand the PA \u201cencouraged, incentivized, and assisted\u201d ter-\nrorists who killed or injured the plaintiffs and their family \nmembers. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 80 (quoting Fuld Am. Compl. \u00b6 \n4). In one of these cases, a trial convinced a jury that the \nplaintiffs were right, and the plaintiffs obtained an award \n \n1 The PLO and the PA \u201cdo not dispute that they \u2018made payments\u2019\u201d \nto compensate terrorists \u201csufficient to satisfy the PSJVTA\u2019s first stat-\nutory prong for \u2018deemed consent,\u2019\u201d Fuld v.

Supp. 3d 577, 583 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2022)), and have not argued on appeal that their offices and \nactivities in the United States do not meet the second statutory prong. \nThe panel did not question the plaintiffs\u2019 plausible allegations that the \nstatutory predicates have been met. \n\n230a \n \n \nof $655.5 million. Waldman v. PLO (Waldman I), 835 F.3d \n317, 324 (2d Cir. 2016). \nInvalidating an act of Congress is \u201cthe gravest and \nmost delicate duty that [a federal court] is called on to per-\nform.\u201d Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) \n(Holmes, J.). In these cases, Congress adopted and the \nPresident signed the legislation \u201cin furtherance of their \nstance on a matter of foreign policy,\u201d and \u201c[a]ction in that \nrealm warrants respectful review by courts.\u201d Bank \nMarkazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016). Not only \nthat, but the legislation was enacted specifically to over-\ncome the panel\u2019s two prior dismissals of the plaintiffs\u2019 law-\nsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Waldman I, 835 \nF.3d 317; Waldman v. PLO (Waldman II), 925 F.3d 570 \n(2d Cir. 2019). Congress has now deliberately and une-\nquivo cally authorized the federal courts to entertain this \nlawsuit, but the panel dismissed it for a third time. \nAccording to the panel, Congress may \u201crequire sub-\nmission to federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d only \u201cin exchange \nfor, or as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit or \nprivilege.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 91. The PLO and the PA knew \nthat supporting terrorists who killed or injured Americans \nand maintaining an office and conducting activities in the \nUnited States would subject them to the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts; the organizations knowingly and voluntar-\nily engaged in that conduct anyway. But the panel never-\ntheless concluded that subjecting the PLO and the PA to \nfederal court jurisdiction \u201ccannot be reconciled with \u2018tradi-\ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n101 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Off. of Unem-\nployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). \nThe panel\u2019s decision lacks a basis in the Constitution \nand cannot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent \non personal jurisdiction. The decision rests on three legal \n\n231a \n \n \nerrors. First, the panel incorrectly held that Congress \nmay deem a foreign entity to have consented to personal \njurisdiction based on its conduct only if the foreign entity \nreceives a reciprocal benefit. Id. at 91. No law requires \nCongress to extend a benefit to those over whom it author-\nizes personal jurisdiction. Instead, as the Supreme Court \nhas made clear, consent based on conduct need only be \nknowing and voluntary and have a nexus to the forum. In \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., the Supreme \nCourt held that Pennsylvania may deem, via statute, an \nout-of-state corporation\u2019s registration to do business to be \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania. 600 U.S. \n122, 127 (2023). \u201cHaving made the choice to register and do \nbusiness in Pennsylvania, despite the jurisdictional conse-\nquences (and having thereby voluntarily relinquished the \ndue process rights our general- jurisdiction precedents af-\nford), Norfolk Southern cannot be heard to complain that \nits due process rights are violated by having to defend it-\nself in Pennsylvania\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at 149 (Jackson, J., con-\ncurring). The PLO and the PA similarly chose to take ac-\ntions with a nexus to the United States knowing the juris-\ndictional consequences. \nSecond, even if the panel were correct that the Due \nProcess Clause required a reciprocal benefit, the statute \nhere involves such a benefit because the defendants are \ndeemed to have consented based on the privilege of resid-\ning and conducting business in the United States\u2014not to \nmention furthering their political goals at the expense of \nAmerican lives. The panel claimed that the conduct of busi-\nness by the PLO and the PA in the United States does not \namount to a benefit because \u201cfederal law has long prohib-\nited the defendants from engaging in any activities or \nmaintaining any offices in the United States, absent spe-\ncific executive or statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. \nBut it is perverse to suggest that a foreign entity may \n\n232a \n \n \nunlawfully extract a benefit from the forum and receive \nconstitutional protection from personal jurisdiction while \na foreign entity conducting lawful activities in the forum \ndoes not receive such protection. \nThird, the panel held that the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment imposes the same limits on the juris-\ndiction of the federal courts that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the jurisdiction \nof the state courts. Id. at 102-05. The Supreme Court has \nexpressly left \u201copen the question whether the Fifth \nAmendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction by a federal court\u201d as the Four-\nteenth Amendment imposes on a state court. Bristol-My-\ners Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 \n(2017).2 I would hold that the federal government is not \nsimilarly situated to the state governments in the extrater-\nritorial reach of its courts. For that reason, the due pro-\ncess standards limiting the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nare not the same. \nThese cases involve a \u201cquestion of exceptional im-\nportance,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2), because Congress has \nadopted legislation making clear the policy of the federal \ngovernment that the PLO and the PA should be subject to \n \n2 The Supreme Court has not reached the issue of the Fifth Amend-\nment Due Process Clause\u2014even though it has considered the reach \nof personal jurisdiction in the federal courts\u2014because the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure generally limit personal jurisdiction in the \nfederal courts \u201cto the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in \nthe state where the district is located.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). For \nthat reason, the case law regarding personal jurisdiction in the federal \ncourts applies the Fourteenth Amendment standards applicable to the \nstates. See, e.g., Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014) \n(\u201cFederal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds \nof their jurisdiction over persons.\u201d). It is important to note, however, \nthat the federal rules also allow personal jurisdiction to be established \n\u201cwhen authorized by a federal statute.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C). \n\n233a \n \n \npersonal jurisdiction in the federal courts. The panel, how-\never, held that the Constitution prohibits Congress from \npursuing that policy. Invaliding an act of Congress would \nentail a question of exceptional importance on its own.3 But \nthese cases also involve (1) significant questions about con-\nstitutional limits on the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \n(2) judicial deference to the political branches in the realm \nof foreign affairs, and (3) the invalidation of a jury verdict \nand award under the ATA. We should have reheard these \ncases en banc. \nBACKGROUND \nThe panel decision in these cases resulted from an ex-\ntended back-and-forth between the panel and Congress. \nThe plaintiffs brought suit under the ATA\u2014which pro-\nvides a remedy against \u201cany person who aids and abets\u201d a \nterrorist attack \u201cby knowingly providing substantial as-\nsistance\u201d  to  the perpetrator, 18  U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)\u2014\nand sought damages from the PLO and the PA for \nterrorist attacks that killed or wounded themselves or \ntheir family members. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 322. The \n \n3 The invalidation of a federal statute is a primary reason for the Su-\npreme Court to grant a petition for certiorari. See, e.g., Allen v. Cooper, \n589 U.S. 248, 254 (2020) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals held a federal \nstatute invalid, this Court granted certiorari.\u201d); Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 \nU.S. 388, 392 (2019) (\u201cAs usual when a lower court has invalidated a \nfederal statute, we granted certiorari.\u201d); United States v. Kebodeaux, \n570 U.S. 387, 391 (2013) (\u201c[I]n light of the fact that a Federal Court of \nAppeals has held a federal statute unconstitutional, we granted the \npetition.\u201d); United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 605 (2000) (\u201cBe-\ncause the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal statute on constitu-\ntional grounds, we granted certiorari.\u201d); United States v. Edge Broad. \nCo., 509 U.S. 418, 425 (1993) (\u201cBecause the court below declared a fed-\neral statute unconstitutional and applied reasoning that was question-\nable under our cases \u2026 we granted certiorari.\u201d); see also Tejas N. \nNarechania, Certiorari in Important Cases, 122 Colum. L. Rev. 923, \n927-28 (2022). \n\n234a \n \n \ndistrict court held that it had personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendants, and after a trial \u201ca jury found that the defend-\nants, acting through their employees, perpetrated the at-\ntacks and that the defendants knowingly provided mate-\nrial support to organizations designated by the United \nStates State Department as foreign terrorist organiza-\ntions.\u201d Id. The jury awarded damages of $218.5 million, \ntrebled pursuant to the ATA to $655.5 million. Id.4 \nThe panel overturned the jury verdict and dismissed \nthe case in 2016, holding that the district court lacked per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA. Waldman I, \n835 F.3d at 337. The panel concluded that the test for per-\nsonal jurisdiction \u201cis the same under the Fifth Amend-\nment and the Fourteenth Amendment in civil cases\u201d and \napplied the traditional Fourteenth Amendment personal \njurisdiction test to the reach of the federal courts. Id. at \n331. The panel held that the district court lacked general \npersonal jurisdiction because the PLO and the PA were \n\u201cfairly regarded as at home\u201d in the Palestinian territories \nand not in New York, id. at 332 (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. \nat 137), and that there was no specific personal jurisdiction \n \n4 The jury made findings regarding the defendants\u2019 involvement in \nseveral different terrorist attacks. For example, with respect to Ha-\nmas\u2019s bombing of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem on July 31, \n2002, the jury found that the defendants \u201cknowingly provided material \nsupport or resources that were used in preparation for or in carrying \nout this attack\u201d; that \u201can employee of the PA, acting within the scope \nof his employment and in furtherance of the activities of the PA, either \ncarried out, or knowingly provided material support,\u201d for the attack; \nthat both the PLO and the PA knowingly provided material support \nto Hamas following its designation as a foreign terrorist organization; \nand that both defendants \u201charbored or concealed a person who the [de-\nfendants] knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe, committed or \nwas about to commit this attack.\u201d Jury Verdict Form at 5-6, Sokolow \nv. PLO, No. 04-CV-00397 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2015), ECF No. 825. \n\n235a \n \n \nbecause the terrorist attacks \u201cwere not sufficiently con-\nnected to the United States,\u201d id. at 337.5 \nIn response to Waldman I, Congress enacted the Anti-\nTerrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), which pro-\nvided that a defendant will be \u201cdeemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction\u201d if, after 120 days, it receives cer-\ntain forms of American assistance or has its headquarters \nor office under United States jurisdiction. Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, \u00a7 4(a). The plaintiffs requested that the panel recall \nthe Waldman I mandate given the new statute, but the \npanel rejected that request because the plaintiffs had \u201cnot \nshown that either factual predicate of Section 4 of the \nATCA has been satisfied\u201d with respect to the PLO or the \nPA. Waldman II, 925 F.3d at 574. \nIn response to Waldman II, Congress acted again. \nCongress enacted, and the President signed, the Promot-\ning Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of \n2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d). The PSJVTA, codified in relevant part \nat 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), left no ambiguity that Congress in-\ntended to subject the PLO and the PA to the jurisdiction \nof the federal courts based on voluntary contacts with the \nUnited States. The statute expressly defines \u201cdefendant\u201d \n \n5 The district court\u2019s decision on personal jurisdiction occurred prior \nto Daimler, 571 U.S. 117, and Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277 (2014), \nwhich limited general personal jurisdiction over foreign corporations \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior \nto these cases, federal courts exercised personal jurisdiction in terror-\nism cases such as these. See, e.g., Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., \n82 F. Supp. 3d 237, 239 (D.D.C. 2015) (\u201cIn 2006, the Court determined \nthat it could exercise general personal jurisdiction over the PA and \nPLO based on their \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the \nUnited States.\u201d); Mwani v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nThe Waldman I panel relied on Daimler to reject this earlier consen-\nsus. Neither Daimler nor Walden, however, involved the Fifth \nAmendment or a congressional enactment expressly authorizing per-\nsonal jurisdiction. \n\n236a \n \n \nto include the PLO, the PA, or any successor or affiliate \nof these entities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). It also provides \nnew factual predicates that are considered consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in American courts for ATA suits. Any \n\u201cdefendant\u201d\u2014that is, the PLO or the PA\u2014\u201cshall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \u2026 if \u2026 \nthe defendant\u201d: \n(A) [after 120 days following enactment] makes any \npayment, directly or indirectly\u2014 \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, \nafter being fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been \nimprisoned for committing any act of terrorism \nthat injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of such \nimprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, follow-\ning such individual\u2019s death while committing an act \nof terrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason \nof the death of such individual; or \n(B) after 15 days [following enactment]\u2014 \n(i) continues to maintain any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in \nthe United States; \n(ii) establishes or procures any office, headquar-\nters, premises, or other facilities or establish-\nments in the United States; or \n(iii) conducts any activity while physically present \nin the United States on behalf of the Palestine Lib-\neration Organization or the Palestinian Authority. \n\n237a \n \n \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1).6 The statute provides that engaging in ei-\nther of these two conduct predicates\u2014payments for ter-\nrorism or premises or activities in the United States\u2014\nqualifies as consent to personal jurisdiction. \nThe plaintiffs allege that both prongs of \u00a7 2334(e)(1) \nare met. The PLO and the PA continued past the 120-day \nnotice period to make payments to both the designees and \nfamily members of terrorists who committed acts of ter-\nrorism that killed or injured American nationals.

In these \nappeals, neither the defendants nor the panel disputed \nthat the PLO and the PA engaged in the relevant conduct \nto be covered by the PSJVTA. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 85-86.7  \nThe panel nevertheless affirmed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand held that both prongs of \u00a7 2334(e) are unconstitutional \nbecause the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 101. \nDISCUSSION \nThe panel opinion invokes the purportedly fundamen-\ntal \u201cliberty interest\u201d of the PLO and the PA that \u201cflow[s] \nfrom the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of due process\u201d and \n\u201censures that a court will exercise personal jurisdiction \n \n6 The statute exempts activities such as the conduct of business at \nthe United Nations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). \n7 In any event, on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwe must \u201cconstrue the pleadings \u2026 in the light most favorable to [the \nplaintiffs], resolving all doubts in [their] favor.\u201d DiStefano v.

So if tomorrow the Department of State rec-\nognized the PA as the sovereign government of \u201cPales-\ntine\u201d\u2014as the defendants believe it is\u2014then there would \nbe no question at all that the PSJVTA is constitutional and \nthat the Due Process Clause is not implicated.9 Funda-\nmental constitutional rights are not typically so contin-\ngent.10 \n \n8 See Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the \nUnited Nations, Diplomatic Relations, https://perma.cc/E5JB-\nSLZK. \n9 Cf.

I do not see how it \ndoes. \nTo correct the errors of the panel opinion, I would \nhold that \n(1) under the Fourteenth Amendment standards for \npersonal jurisdiction, a legislature does not need to provide \na reciprocal benefit to a foreign entity to subject that entity \nto personal jurisdiction based on knowing and voluntary \nconduct with a nexus to the forum, \n(2) even if there were a reciprocal benefit requirement, \nthe PLO and the PA benefited from conducting business \nin the United States, and \n(3) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not impose the same limits on the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts that the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment imposes on the state courts. Given any \none of these conclusions, the district court may exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in these \ncases. \nI \nThere is no requirement that a statutory provision that \ndeems certain conduct to signify consent to personal juris-\ndiction must be based on \u201creciprocal bargains.\u201d Fuld, 82 \nF.4th at 90.11 Even assuming that constitutional due \n \n11 The concurrence denies that the panel opinion created a recipro-\ncal- bargain requirement\u2014even though it simultaneously distin-\nguishes Mallory on the ground that it \u201cinvolved reciprocal bargains\u201d \nand explains that the PSJVTA is unconstitutional because the PLO \nand the PA \u201creceived no benefit,\u201d \u201chave not received any benefit in \nthe forum,\u201d and participated in \u201cno similar exchange of benefits.\u201d Ante \nat 6, 13, 15. The purported denial is simply the observation that con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction may be achieved through other means not \nrelevant here, such as \u201clitigation-related activities.\u201d Id. at 6. No one dis-\nputes that point. But the panel opinion clearly invented a new re-\nquirement that applies when Congress or a state legislature \n\n241a \n \n \nprocess limits the ability of federal courts to exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction, the PSJVTA does not conflict with due \nprocess because it establishes personal jurisdiction if a de-\nfendant knowingly and voluntarily undertakes actions \nwith a nexus to the forum. The panel erred in concluding \notherwise. \nA \nThe Supreme Court recently decided Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk Southern Railway Co., in which the Court considered \n\u201cwhether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment prohibits a State from requiring an out-of-\nstate corporation to consent to personal jurisdiction to do \nbusiness there,\u201d as Pennsylvania had done. 600 U.S. at \n127. The Supreme Court said that the Pennsylvania stat-\nute was constitutional. Five justices noted that the case \nwas controlled by earlier precedent in which the Court had \nsaid that \u201cthere was \u2018no doubt\u2019\u201d a company \u201ccould be sued \nin Missouri by an out-of-state plaintiff on an out-of- state \ncontract because it had agreed to accept service of process \nin Missouri on any suit as a condition of doing business \nthere.\u201d Id. at 133 (plurality opinion) (quoting Pa. Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 95 \n(1917)). Those five justices agreed that consent was an in-\ndependent basis for jurisdiction; because the require-\nments of International Shoe apply only to \u201can out-of-state \ncorporation that has not consented to in-state suits,\u201d those \nrequirements were inapplicable. Id. at 138 (plurality opin-\nion); accord id. at 152 (Alito, J.)

Tag jurisdiction was permissible \nbecause \u201can in personam suit against an individual \u2018for in-\njuries that might have happened any where\u2019 was generally \nconsidered a \u2018transitory\u2019 action that followed the individ-\nual,\u201d which \u201cmeant that a suit could be maintained by any-\none on any claim in any place the defendant could be \nfound.\u201d Id.

Id. \nat 129-30.12 \nThe Supreme Court in Mallory stressed that \u201cunder \nour precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the defendant\u2019 that \nmay seem like technicalities nonetheless can \u2018amount to a \nlegal submission to the jurisdiction of a court,\u2019\u201d 600 U.S. \nat 146 (plurality opinion) (quoting Ins.

Justice Alito observed \nthat \u201cthe most appropriate home for these principles is the so-called \ndormant Commerce Clause\u201d rather than the Due Process Clause.

The defendant need not specifically intend \nto consent to jurisdiction but need only take a \u201cvoluntary \nact\u201d that the law treats as consent. Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at \n96.13 The \u201cprecedents approving other forms of consent to \npersonal jurisdiction have [n]ever imposed some sort of \n\u2018magic words\u2019 requirement\u201d or required a particular for-\nmula. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5 (majority opinion). \nThe Supreme Court has thus explained that deemed-\nconsent statutes are consistent with the Constitution and \nlimited only by the sovereign reach of the forum state, as \nillustrated by the analogy to tag jurisdiction. The panel, \nhowever, artificially constrained the power of a legislature \nto adopt such a statute to two narrow circumstances: (1) \n\u201clitigation-related conduct\u201d or (2) \u201cwhere a defendant ac-\ncepts a benefit from the forum in exchange for its amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 88. \nLimiting the power of Congress or a state legislature to \nthese stylized circumstances conflicts with Mallory. \nThe consent of the foreign entity must only be knowing \nand voluntary and involve some nexus to the forum such \n \n13 See Smolik v.

(\u201cWhen it is said that a foreign corpora-\ntion will be taken to have consented to the appointment of an agent to \naccept service, the court does not mean that as a fact it has consented \nat all, because the corporation does not in fact consent; but the court, \nfor purposes of justice, treats it as if it had. It is true that the conse-\nquences so imputed to it lie within its own control, since it need not do \nbusiness within the state, but that is not equivalent to a consent; actu-\nally it might have refused to appoint, and yet its refusal would make \nno difference. The court, in the interests of justice, imputes results to \nthe voluntary act of doing business within the foreign state, quite in-\ndependently of any intent.\u201d). \n\n244a \n \n \nthat requiring consent would not be \u201cunfair.\u201d Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion); id. at 153-54 (Alito, J.). The \nPennsylvania law at issue in Mallory did not involve an ac-\ntual bargain or a \u201cvoluntary agreement,\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at \n87, between the state and each company. Rather, Norfolk \nSouthern was deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction from the fact of it having registered under 15 \nPa. Stat. \u00a7 411(a). That is because a separate statute treats \n\u201c\u2018qualification as a foreign corporation\u2019 to be a \u2018sufficient \nbasis\u2019 for Pennsylvania courts \u2018to exercise general per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u2019 over an out-of-state company.\u201d Mal-\nlory, 600 U.S. at 151 (Alito, J.) (quoting 42 Pa. Stat. \n\u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i) (2019)). Neither statute indicated that per-\nsonal jurisdiction was being exchanged for the benefit of \noperating in Pennsylvania; the statutes did not even refer-\nence each other.14 Instead, like the PSJVTA, the statute \n\u201csimply declared that specific activities\u201d such as register-\ning to do business in the state sufficed to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 97. In this way, con-\ntrary to the suggestion of the concurrence, the statute \nbears a \u201creasonable resemblance to the deemed consent \nprovisions of the PSJVTA.\u201d Ante at 8. \n \n14 It is true that the Mallory opinions mention an \u201cexchange.\u201d 600 \nU.S. at 130 (plurality opinion); id. at 151 (Alito, J.). But the Court did \nnot hold that such an exchange was required, and the description of \ndeemed-consent statutes as analogous to tag jurisdiction demon-\nstrates that it was not. The Court referenced the notion of exchange \nonly to respond to the argument of Norfolk Southern that enforcing \nPennsylvania\u2019s statute would be \u201cunfair.\u201d Id. at 141-43 (plurality opin-\nion); id. at 153 (Alito, J.). The plurality said: \u201c[I]f fairness is what Nor-\nfolk Southern seeks, pause for a moment to measure this suit against \nthat standard.\u201d Id. at 141 (plurality opinion). The circumstances of this \ncase similarly evince no unfairness to the PLO and the PA in requiring \ntravel from the offices those entities maintain in the United States to \nanswer for violations of the Anti-Terrorism Act. \n\n245a \n \n \n\u201cNorfolk Southern is a sophisticated entity, and we \nmay \u2018presume\u2019 that it \u2018acted with knowledge\u2019 of state law \nwhen it registered\u201d and, consequently, \u201cby registering, it \nconsented to all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 151 (Alito, J.) (alteration omitted) \n(quoting Com. Mut. Accident Co. v. Davis, 213 U.S. 245, \n254 (1909)). Norfolk Southern consented to general per-\nsonal jurisdiction by taking a voluntary action in connection \nwith the forum with knowledge that state law deemed the \naction to be consent. The PLO and the PA each also acted \nvoluntarily with knowledge that its actions would subject \nit to the jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nIn neither case was there an actual \u201cvoluntary agree-\nment on the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular \nforum.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 87. But that is not required. The \ndistrict court was correct that \u201cDefendants do not cite, and \nthe Court has not found, any case holding that \u2026 receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d \nat 595 n.10. Rather, the cases emphasize the knowing and \nvoluntary nature of the conduct. See Pa.

Knowing that it would be deemed consent to \nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts, the PLO and the PA \ncontinued making covered payments after the 120- day pe-\nriod specified in the PSJVTA. There is a nexus to the fo-\nrum because the payments compensated terrorists for at-\ntacks that killed or injured American nationals.

Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion). \nThe second prong of the PSJVTA is even more clearly \npermissible because it parallels the statute upheld \nin Mallory.

Prior to 2018, the United States gave the PLO and \nthe PA hundreds of millions of dollars, but starting in 2018, pursuant \nto the Taylor Force Act, the United States ended such assistance un-\nless the PLO and the PA terminated the payments.

The PLO and the PA, as \u201cso-\nphisticated entit[ies],\u201d understood that such conduct \nwould be treated as consent to jurisdiction. Id. at 151 \n(Alito, J.). The Constitution does not excuse such sophisti-\ncated entities from the consequences of their informed \nchoices. \nB \nTo avoid this conclusion, the panel analogized personal \njurisdiction to other constitutional rights, such as the Sixth \nAmendment right to a jury trial and the states\u2019 sovereign \nimmunity from suit. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 98-100. The concur-\nrence relies on the same comparisons. See ante at 11-12. \nBut the analogies do not work. Imagine the statute the Su-\npreme Court upheld in Mallory applied to the Sixth \nAmendment right to a jury trial. The statute would read: \n\u201c[A]ny foreign corporation that registers to do business in \nPennsylvania automatically consents to waive its Sixth \nAmendment right to trial by jury.\u201d Or apply it to state sov-\nereign immunity: \u201c[A]ny state whose agent operates in \nPennsylvania automatically waives its state sovereign im-\nmunity.\u201d These statutes would not be upheld as easily as \nthe Mallory statute.17 \nA \u201ctribunal\u2019s competence\u201d to exercise personal juris-\ndiction has been \u201cgenerally constrained only by the \u2018terri-\ntorial limits\u2019 of the sovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 128 (plurality opinion) (quoting Story, supra, \u00a7 539, \nat 450-51). Personal jurisdiction therefore depends on the \npowers assigned to the state and federal governments. \nNeither an enumerated right nor sovereign immunity \nworks the same way. This becomes obvious when we \n \n17 Nor would a state be able to deprive a defendant of the right to \ntrial by jury if the defendant takes \u201csome act by which [it] purposefully \navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum \nState.\u201d Hanson v.

There is no question that if an \nindividual official of the PLO and the PA visited the \nUnited States, he could be served personally with process \nand thereby subjected to the jurisdiction of American \ncourts. A deemed-consent statute such as the PSJVTA is \nsimply the adaptation of tag jurisdiction to artificial per-\nsons and works the same way.18 By contrast, no statute \ncould deem mere presence in the United States to be a \nwaiver of the right to trial by jury. \nII \nEven if the panel were correct that the Constitution \nrequires a deemed-consent statute to be based on a benefit \nto a defendant in exchange for jurisdiction, there still \nwould be jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in these \ncases. \nA \nThe complaint alleges that the PLO and the PA main-\ntained premises and engaged in official activities in \nthe United States knowing that such conduct in the \nUnited States would result in the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction.

The PLO and \nthe PA faced a choice between (1) refraining from main-\ntaining an office and engaging in covered activity within \nthe United States and thereby avoiding personal jurisdic-\ntion and (2) maintaining an office and engaging in covered \nactivity and thereby consenting to personal jurisdiction. \nThe defendants knowingly and voluntarily opted for the \nbenefits of residing and acting in the United States. \nThe panel, however, reasoned that \u201cthe statute does \nnot provide the PLO or the PA with any such benefit or \npermission\u201d because \u201cfederal law has long prohibited the \ndefendants from engaging in any activities or maintaining \nany offices in the United States, absent specific executive \nor statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. The fact that \nthe PLO and the PA extracted a benefit from the United \nStates in violation of the law\u2014and additionally benefited \nfrom the federal government\u2019s nonenforcement of the \nlaw\u2014does not alter the fact that those organizations re-\nceived the benefit from the forum that the statute envi-\nsions. See Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at 96 (noting that a corpora-\ntion \u201cwould be presumed to have assented\u201d to jurisdiction \nbased on \u201ca mere fiction, justified by holding the corpora-\ntion estopped to set up its own wrong as a defense\u201d). \nThe panel insisted that \u201c[t]urning a blind eye to pro-\nhibited conduct that remains subject to sanction or curtail-\nment is not the same as authorizing such conduct,\u201d sug-\ngesting that a party can obtain a benefit from a forum only \nif the forum state affirmatively blesses its conduct. Fuld, \n82 F.4th at 93 n.10. This argument is strange. It means \nthat the Constitution protects a foreign entity from the \n\n250a \n \n \njurisdiction of the federal courts if the entity conducts il-\nlegal activities in the United States but does not extend \nsuch protection to foreign entities that act legally in the \nUnited States. Yet a foreign actor that conducts unau-\nthorized business in the United States has obtained an \neven greater benefit from the forum than the foreign actor \nthat complies with American law. The unauthorized actor \nhas extracted a benefit at the expense of the policy under-\nlying the forum state\u2019s laws while the authorized actor has \nnot benefited from such harm to the forum. Cf. Goodyear \nDunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 926 \n(2011) (noting that personal jurisdiction over \u201ca nonresi-\ndent defendant\u201d may be based on it causing \u201charm inside \nthe forum\u201d). \nIn any event, the conduct of business by the PLO and \nthe PA in the United States was not unauthorized because \nthe federal government followed a nonenforcement policy \nwith respect to its activities, \u201cpermit[ing] certain activities \nas \u2018a matter of grace.\u2019\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 93 n.10 (quoting \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Reply Br. 25). There is no reason for the federal \ncourts to be policing the distinction between a benefit con-\nferred by the executive branch\u2019s enforcement discretion \nand a benefit conferred by the legislative branch\u2019s enact-\nment of legislation. The federal government deals with for-\neign entities through a variety of means, and no law privi-\nleges legislatively conferred benefits over those conferred \nby the executive branch, especially in the field of foreign \nrelations.19 \n \n19 Cf.

The concurrence believes it \nwould be improper for Congress to punish the unlawful \nconduct of the PLO and the PA. But Congress often cre-\nates civil liability to penalize unlawful conduct. The whole \npremise of specific personal jurisdiction is that wrongful \nconduct in the forum gives the forum an interest in subject-\ning the bad actor to the jurisdiction of its courts. See, e.g., \nFord Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. \n351, 355 (2021). And tag jurisdiction, the analogue of \ndeemed-consent statutes, has never been limited only to \nthose lawfully present in the forum. See Burnham, 495 \nU.S. at 610-11. \nIn any event, the PSJVTA simply subjects each defend-\nant to the jurisdiction of the federal courts by virtue of its \nconduct in the forum. That is not a penalty for unlawful \nconduct; it merely extends jurisdiction over parties en-\ngaged in conduct in the forum. The connection to the fo-\nrum, rather than the unlawfulness of the conduct, is what \nestablishes jurisdiction. \nThe concurrence purports to find its novel principle \nabout punishment in the Supreme Court\u2019s gloss on the \nnineteenth-century decision Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 \n(1897). See ante at 17; see also Fuld, 82 F.4th at 94 (discuss-\ning Hovey). According to the concurrence, in Insurance \nCorp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court distinguished the \ncase before it from Hovey, \u201cin which the Court held that it \n\u2018violated due process for a court to take similar action as \npunishment for failure to obey an order to pay into the reg-\nistry of the court a certain sum of money.\u2019\u201d Ante at 17 (in-\nternal quotation marks and alteration omitted) (quoting \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 706). In Hovey, as punishment \nfor contempt for failure to comply with the court-ordered \npayment, the supreme court of the District of Columbia \nstruck the defendant\u2019s entire answer from the record \n\n253a \n \n \nand ordered \u201cthat this cause do proceed as if no answer \nherein had been interposed.\u201d 167 U.S. at 411. The U.S. Su-\npreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ccourts have inherent \npower to deny all right to defend an action, and to render \ndecrees without any hearing whatever.\u201d Id. at 414. It dis-\napproved of the D.C. court\u2019s action as inconsistent with due \nprocess because \u201c[a]t common law no man was condemned \nwithout being afforded opportunity to be heard,\u201d id. at \n415, and because it cannot be \u201cdoubted that due process of \nlaw signifies a right to be heard in one\u2019s defense,\u201d id. at 417. \nIn Insurance Corp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court \ncited Hovey for the proposition that it would violate due \nprocess \u201cto create a presumption of fact\u201d regarding per-\nsonal jurisdiction as a punishment without affording the \ndefendant the opportunity to be heard, unless that pre-\nsumption was based on the principle that \u201crefusal to pro-\nduce evidence material to the administration of due pro-\ncess was but an admission of the want of merit in the as-\nserted defense.\u201d 456 U.S. at 705-06 (quoting Hammond \nPacking Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 350-51 (1909)). \nThe idea expressed in Hovey and Insurance Corp. of \nIreland\u2014that it would violate the Due Process Clause to \ndeny a defendant the opportunity to be heard in its own \ndefense\u2014is well established. But it has nothing to do with \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA. The PLO and the PA \nhave not been denied the opportunity to dispute either the \nfacts on which personal jurisdiction is based or the facts on \nwhich liability is based. There has been no denial of the \ndefendants\u2019 rights to notice and an opportunity to be \nheard, nor did the district court assert personal jurisdic-\ntion over the defendants as a penalty for non- compliance \nwith court orders. Neither Hovey nor Insurance Corp. of \nIreland establishes a general principle that a defendant \ncannot be made subject to suit\u2014about which the \n\n254a \n \n \ndefendant receives notice and an opportunity to be \nheard\u2014when that defendant engages in unlawful conduct. \nBased on that dubious principle, however, the panel has \nadded two requirements on top of the Supreme Court\u2019s \nstraightforward rule for establishing consent-based juris-\ndiction: First, the consent must be granted in exchange for \nthe extension of a benefit to the foreign actor. Second, the \nbenefit must be affirmatively authorized by a statute. \nThese requirements are not rooted in the Constitution, \nand the additional complexity creates needless confusion \nand absurd results. \nIII \nFor the foregoing reasons, even accepting the panel\u2019s \npremise that the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the jurisdiction of the federal courts as the \nFourteenth Amendment imposes on the state courts, the \nPSJVTA still would be constitutional. But the premise is \nincorrect. The Supreme Court has reserved judgment on \n\u201cwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a fed-\neral court\u201d as the Fourteenth Amendment does on a state \ncourt. Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 269. Recent \nscholarship has shown that the Fifth Amendment does not \nimpose such limits. See Brief for Constitutional Law Schol-\nars Philip C. Bobbitt, Michael C. Dorf, and H. Jefferson \nPowell as Amici Curiae in Support of Plaintiffs-Appel-\nlants, Fuld v. PLO, 82 F.4th 74 (2023) (Nos. 22-76, 22-496), \nECF No. 72; see also Max Crema & Lawrence B. Solum, \nThe Original Meaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the \nFifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447 (2022); Stephen E. \nSachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, \n106 Va. L. Rev. 1703 (2020).  \nOur court has acknowledged that \u201c[r]ecent scholarship \nsuggests that we err in viewing due process as an \n\n255a \n \n \nindependent constraint on a court\u2019s exercise of personal \njurisdiction.\u201d Gater Assets Ltd. v. AO Moldovagaz, 2 F.4th \n42, 66 n.23 (2d Cir. 2021). And other judges have argued \nthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does \nnot limit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal \ncourts. See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, 598 (D.C. Cir. \n2023) (Rao, J., concurring) (\u201cThere is little (or no) evidence \nthat courts and commentators in the Founding Era under-\nstood the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause to im-\npose a minimum contacts requirement. On the contrary, \nthe widespread assumption was that Congress could ex-\ntend federal personal jurisdiction by statute.\u201d); Douglass \nv. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 255 (5th \nCir. 2022) (en banc) (Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe text, his-\ntory, and structural implications of the Fifth Amendment \nDue Process Clause suggest that its original public mean-\ning imposed few (if any) barriers to federal court personal \njurisdiction.\u201d); id. at 282 (Higginson, J., dissenting) (\u201c[B]y \nimporting Fourteenth Amendment constraints on per-\nsonal jurisdiction, born out of federalism concerns, into \nprocess due to foreign corporations in global disputes, \nwhere those concerns don\u2019t exist, our court makes several \nmistakes.\u201d); id. at 284 (Oldham, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A]s orig-\ninally understood, the Fifth Amendment did not impose \nany limits on the personal jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts. Instead, it was up to Congress to impose such lim-\nits by statute.\u201d); see also Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. \nv. Antrix Corp. Ltd., 91 F.4th 1340, 1352 (9th Cir. 2024) \n(Bumatay, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc) (\u201cJustice Story opined that foreign-based defend-\nants were owed no more than service authorized by Con-\ngress before being haled into our federal courts.\u201d). \nThat view is correct, and I would adopt it. \n\n256a \n \n \nA \nFrom the founding to the Civil War, no one suggested \nthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment lim-\nited the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal \ncourts. See Sachs, supra, at 1704. The Clause required \nonly that \u201cdeprivations of life, liberty, or property must be \npreceded by process of law in th[e] narrow and technical \nlegal sense\u201d of legitimate service of process that could en-\nsure notice and an opportunity to be heard. Crema & So-\nlum, supra, at 451-52. After the Fifth Amendment was rat-\nified, federal courts continued to follow general law princi-\nples according to which tag jurisdiction allowed anyone \nserved with process in the forum to be subject to personal \njurisdiction there. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128; Massie v. \nWatts, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 162-63 (1810). \u201c[N]ot until \nthe Civil War did a single court, state or federal, hold a \npersonal-jurisdiction statute invalid on due process \ngrounds.\u201d Sachs, supra, at 1712. \nThe history demonstrates that, outside of the limits im-\nposed by service of process, \u201c[a] federal court\u2019s writ may \nrun as far as Congress, within its enumerated powers, \nwould have it go.\u201d Id. at 1704. In the early republic, the \nlimitations on the federal courts\u2019 exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction derived from general and international law\u2014 \nnot from the Fifth Amendment\u2014and Congress could al-\nways override those limitations. Just as states had limited \npower to reach outside their \u201cterritorial limits,\u201d Story, su-\npra, \u00a7 539, at 450, the general law of nations limited the \npower of the national government to exercise jurisdiction \nover persons located abroad, Sachs, supra, at 1708-17. \nHowever, Congress could depart from the default rules \n\n257a \n \n \nof international law by a clearly worded statute, and the Su-\npreme Court said it would honor such laws.23 \nIn 1828, while riding circuit, Justice Story considered \na case in which an alien sued a non-resident American citi-\nzen in federal court. Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 \n(C.C.D. Mass. 1828). Story acknowledged that under \u201cthe \nprinciples of common law,\u201d \u201cin the contemplation of the \nframers of the judiciary act of 1789, \u2026 independent of \nsome positive provision to the contrary, no judgment could \nbe rendered in the circuit court against any person, upon \nwhom process could not be personally served within the \ndistrict.\u201d Id. at 613 (emphasis added). Story recognized \nthat because \u201ca general jurisdiction is given [under Article \nIII] in cases, where an alien is party,\u201d even if the alien \u201cis \nnot an inhabitant of the United States, and has not any \nproperty within it \u2026 still he is amenable to the jurisdiction \nof any circuit court.\u201d Id. If Congress authorized it, \u201ca sub-\nject of England, or France, or Russia, having a contro-\nversy with one of our own citizens, may be summoned from \nthe other end of the globe to obey our process, and submit \nto the judgment of our courts.\u201d Id. While such an extension \nof jurisdiction might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights \nand sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \u201c[i]f congress had \n \n23 See, e.g., The Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815) (\u201cIf it be \nthe will of the government to apply to Spain any rule respecting cap-\ntures which Spain is supposed to apply to us, the government will man-\nifest that will by passing an act for the purpose. Till such an act be \npassed, the Court is bound by the law of nations which is a part of the \nlaw of the land.\u201d); see also Murray v. The Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 \nU.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804) (\u201c[A]n act of Congress ought never to be \nconstrued to violate the law of nations if any other possible construc-\ntion remains.\u201d) (emphasis added); Talbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 \nCranch) 1, 43 (1801) (\u201c[T]he laws of the United States ought not, if it \nbe avoidable, so to be construed as to infract the common principles \nand usages of nations.\u201d) (emphasis added). \n\n258a \n \n \nprescribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound \nto follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613-15. \nThe Supreme Court later embraced that reasoning. \nSee Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 328 (1838). \nIn Toland, an American plaintiff attached the American \nproperty of a defendant domiciled abroad. Id. at 302. The \nSupreme Court decided that the exercise of jurisdiction in \nsuch a case would be \u201cunjust\u201d and that Congress had not \nauthorized such jurisdiction by statute. Id. at 328-29. How-\never, the Court recognized that Story\u2019s analysis in Picquet \nhad \u201cgreat force.\u201d Id. at 328. The Court explained that \n\u201cCongress might have authorized civil process from any \ncircuit court, to have run into any state of the Union,\u201d in-\ncluding as to \u201cpersons in a foreign jurisdiction,\u201d but the \nCourt would not exercise such jurisdiction \u201cindependently \nof positive legislation.\u201d Id. at 330. In this way, the early \ncases show both that the Fifth Amendment did not limit \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction and that Congress \nwas understood to be able to extend such jurisdiction by \nstatute. \nB \nPersonal jurisdiction \u201cperform[s] two related, but dis-\ntinguishable, functions.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 \nU.S. at 291-92. First, it guards against infringements on \nfederalism\u2014that is, \u201cit acts to ensure that the States \nthrough their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits \nimposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in \na federal system.\u201d Id. at 292. Second, it protects an indi-\nvidual liberty interest of \u201cthe defendant against the bur-\ndens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum.\u201d Id. \nThese interests are not implicated to the same extent by \nthe federal government as by state governments, so there \nis no reason to expect the Constitution to impose the same \nrestrictions on the federal and state courts in the \n\n259a \n \n \nexercise of personal jurisdiction. Indeed, \u201cpersonal juris-\ndiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sov-\nereign, analysis.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). \nThe clearest difference is that federalism does not im-\npose the same restrictions on the federal government as it \ndoes on state governments. \u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction cases \nhave discussed the federalism implications of one State\u2019s \nassertion of jurisdiction over the corporate residents of an-\nother,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality opinion), and \nthe Supreme Court has said that \u201cthis federalism interest \nmay be decisive\u201d in the due process analysis when consid-\nering personal jurisdiction. Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. \nat 263. That is because the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment is \u201can instrument of interstate feder-\nalism.\u201d Id. (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at \n294). Because \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State \u2026 implie[s] \na limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d the \nConstitution must ensure that states do not exceed \u201cthe \nlimits imposed on them by their status as coequal sover-\neigns in a federal system.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 \nU.S. at 292. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not an instrument of interstate federalism. \nWhile states may not intrude on each other\u2019s or the federal \ngovernment\u2019s prerogatives, Congress may decide to in-\ntrude on foreign governments\u2019 prerogatives. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 86 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cIf \nit chooses to do so, [Congress] may legislate with respect \nto conduct outside the United States, in excess of the limits \nposed by international law.\u201d) (quoting United States v. \nPinto-Mejia, 720 F.2d 248, 259 (2d Cir. 1983)). \u201c[W]hether \na judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sov-\nereign has authority to render it,\u201d and the federal and \n\n260a \n \n \nstate governments have different authorities. Nicastro, \n564 U.S. at 884. \nThe panel nonetheless concluded that the Fifth \nAmendment must impose the same limits as the Four-\nteenth Amendment because \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s personal \njurisdiction requirements represent a \u2018restriction on judi-\ncial power\u2019 \u2026 \u2018not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a mat-\nter of individual liberty.\u2019\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 103 (alterations \nomitted) (quoting Nicastro, 564 U.S. at 884). However, the \nliberty interest in avoiding inconvenient litigation is also \ndramatically different in the context of the federal courts. \nBecause \u201cdue process protects the individual\u2019s right to be \nsubject only to lawful power,\u201d Nicastro, 564 U.S. at 884, \nthe Supreme Court has emphasized the liberty interest in \navoiding compulsory process that exceeds \u201c\u2018territorial lim-\nitations\u2019 on state power,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 156 (Alito, \nJ.) (quoting Hanson, 357 U.S. at 251). The burden on a de-\nfendant\u2019s liberty interest encompasses \u201cthe practical \nproblems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also \nencompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to \nthe coercive power of a State that may have little legiti-\nmate interest in the claims in question.\u201d Bristol-Myers \nSquibb, 582 U.S. at 263. A defendant in one state generally \ndoes not have \u201cfair warning that a particular activity may \nsubject [it] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472 (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, \n433 U.S. 186, 218 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in the \njudgment)), because a state does not normally regulate ac-\ntivity beyond its borders. So \u201cthe Due Process Clause \n\u2018gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that \nallows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that \nconduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297). \n\n261a \n \n \nThe same limitations do not apply to the federal \ncourts.24 In contrast to state legislatures, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991). In the context of taxing \nextraterritorial property, the Supreme Court has ob-\nserved that while the \u201climits of jurisdiction\u201d of states must \n\u201cbe ascertained in each case with appropriate regard to \u2026 \nthe view of the relation of the states to each other in the \nFederal Union,\u201d there is no basis in the Due Process \nClause to \u201cconstruct[] an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurpose of shutting that government off from the exertion \nof powers which inherently belong to it by virtue of its sov-\nereignty.\u201d Burnet v. Brooks, 288 U.S. 378, 401, 404-05 \n(1933). The authority of Congress to assert legislative \npower extraterritorially means that the federal courts \nmust have a corresponding power to adjudicate disputes \nconcerning its laws. \u201cIf there are such things as political \naxioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \n \n24 Cf.

The federal \ngovernment has broad authority to respond to terrorist at-\ntacks against Americans that foreign entities support. The \nstates do not have the same authority to respond to such \nattacks abroad. Generally, state criminal law is territori-\nally limited. See, e.g., Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.03.

Epskamp, 832 F.3d 154, 168 (2d \nCir. 2016). Accordingly, Congress could criminalize the \nconduct \ndescribed \nin \nthe \nPSJVTA, \n18 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). Providing compensation and incentive \npayments to those who kill or injure Americans\u2014espe-\ncially after the United States repeatedly raised concerns \nabout such payments\u2014involves \u201ca sufficient nexus\u201d to the \nUnited States.

L. No. 114-222, \u00a7 \n2(a)(2), 130 Stat. 852, 852 (2016). Just as Congress\u2019s expansive au-\nthority in foreign affairs is rooted in its commerce power, the \n\u201cfederalism concerns\u201d that underlie the personal jurisdiction stand-\nards developed for state courts under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment may \u201cfall more naturally within the scope of \nthe Commerce Clause.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 157 (Alito, J.). \n\n265a \n \n \nof military force against terrorist organizations that kill \nAmericans and against states supporting such entities.30 \nStates cannot do that. See U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3. It \ndoes not make sense to conclude that the PLO and the PA \nhave no constitutional right to be free from prosecution, \nsanctions, or war in response to supporting terrorism but \nhave an inviolable liberty interest in avoiding a civil suit in \nfederal court on the same basis. \nThe concurrence quotes a six-year-old amicus brief \nfrom the Justice Department in an earlier case for the \nproposition that the panel\u2019s earlier holding on personal ju-\nrisdiction might have allowed some Americans injured by \ninternational terrorism to seek relief in other hypothetical \ncases\u2014even though the panel opinion forecloses such re-\nlief in these cases. See ante at 23-24. The Justice Depart-\nment intervened here, however, to defend the constitu-\ntionality of the PSJVTA, which Congress adopted \u201c[t]o en-\nsure American victims of international terrorism are able \nto seek redress in U.S. courts.\u201d Intervenor-Appellant\u2019s \nPetition for Rehearing En Banc at 1, Fuld v. PLO, Nos. \n22-76 & 22-496 (2d Cir. Nov. 22, 2023), ECF No. 245. The \nJustice Department seeks rehearing because \u201c[a] panel of \nthis [c]ourt erroneously held the PSJVTA\u2019s jurisdictional \nprovision is inconsistent with due process.\u201d Id. The Justice \nDepartment argues that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment permits \nfederal courts to assert personal jurisdiction over a for-\neign defendant in certain circumstances that have no \nanalogue for a state court exercising personal jurisdiction \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d and that \u201cthe \n \n30 See, e.g., Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. No. 107-\n40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001); Authorization for Use of Military Force \nAgainst Iraq Resolution of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-243, 116 Stat. 1498 \n(2002). \n\n266a \n \n \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s limitations should not be \nadopted reflexively into the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 14-\n16.31 \nThe Justice Department is correct. Although due pro-\ncess might protect persons from being subject to extrater-\nritorial adjudication in states whose power the Constitu-\ntion generally limits territorially, the same limitations do \nnot apply to courts established by a sovereign authority \nwith sweeping extraterritorial power. Accordingly, the \nFifth Amendment does not preclude the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction in these cases. \n* \n* \n* \nI would rehear these cases en banc to establish three \npropositions. First, deemed-consent statutes do not re-\nquire an exchange of benefits as long as consent is knowing \nand voluntary and the conduct has a nexus to the forum. \nSecond, even if reciprocity were required, the PSJVTA in-\nvolves such reciprocity because the PLO and the PA re-\nceived benefits by operating in the United States, regard-\nless of whether such operations were lawful. Third, the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not limit \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal courts \nin the same way as the Fourteenth Amendment restricts \nthe state courts. In these cases, the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not leave Congress powerless to afford relief to \n \n31 Members of Congress who adopted the PSJVTA similarly do not \nshare the concurrence\u2019s confidence that the panel opinion does not un-\ndermine the ability of Congress to allow American victims of interna-\ntional terrorism to seek redress. See, e.g., Brief for Richard Blumen-\nthal, Theodore E. Deutch, Charles E. Grassley, James Lankford, \nGrace Meng, Jerrold Nadler, Kathleen Rice, Marco Rubio, Bradley E. \nSchneider, Claudia Tenny, and Lee Zeldin, Fuld v.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of no specific knowledge regarding this case. This observation, while an internal thought process, provides the foundational structure for my analysis. I now understand that the central task is to predict the Supreme Court's ruling on a specific constitutional question.\n\nMy understanding has evolved from a blank slate to a structured awareness of the case's core components:\n-   **Core Legal Question:** The case hinges on whether the \"consent-by-conduct\" provision of the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This is a direct conflict between a congressional statute and a constitutional protection.\n-   **Statutory Mechanism:** Congress attempted to solve a jurisdictional problem by creating a new basis for personal jurisdiction. The statute deems that the PLO and PA consent to jurisdiction in U.S. courts if they perform certain actions, such as making payments to families of terrorists or conducting business in the U.S. This is a novel legislative approach to establishing personal jurisdiction.\n-   **Lower Court Precedent:** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found this statutory provision unconstitutional. This is a significant finding, as federal courts are generally hesitant to strike down acts of Congress. The Supreme Court's decision will either affirm this invalidation or reverse it, thereby creating a major precedent on the scope of congressional power to legislate on jurisdictional matters.\n-   **Key Legal Concepts:** The prediction will depend on the Court's interpretation of personal jurisdiction, specifically how it relates to the traditional \"minimum contacts\" test established in *International Shoe Co. v. Washington* and its progeny. The core tension is whether Congress can create a statutory \"consent\" that bypasses the Court's established due process analysis for personal jurisdiction.\n-   **Case Context:** The case involves foreign entities (the PLO and PA) and arises under the Anti-Terrorism Act, placing it at the intersection of civil litigation, national security, and foreign relations. This context may influence the degree of deference the Court gives to Congress.\n\nMy belief is now that the outcome will be determined by how the Court balances Congress's power to create causes of action and jurisdictional rules, especially in the foreign policy and counter-terrorism realm, against the due process requirement that a defendant have some form of meaningful connection to the forum before being subjected to its jurisdiction. The Second Circuit's decision provides a strong starting point for the arguments against the statute's constitutionality. My next step will be to seek out the specific arguments made by the petitioners to understand how they propose to overcome the Second Circuit's reasoning.",

My initial beliefs established the foundational conflict between a congressional statute (the PSJVTA) and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, as interpreted by the Second Circuit. I recognized the core issue as whether Congress can statutorily define conduct that constitutes consent to personal jurisdiction, bypassing the traditional \"minimum contacts\" analysis.\n\nThe observation of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari provides a crucial layer of detail by revealing the specific legal arguments the petitioners (the victims) will use to persuade the Supreme Court to reverse the Second Circuit. My beliefs are now substantially more detailed:\n\n*   **Refined Legal Framing:** The petitioners are not just arguing for congressional deference in the abstract. They are making a specific and powerful argument that the Second Circuit committed a fundamental error by applying the jurisdictional limitations of the **Fourteenth Amendment** (which constrains states and is rooted in federalism concerns) to a case involving the **Fifth Amendment** (which constrains the federal government). They argue, citing historical sources and scholarship, that the original meaning of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not impose the same territorial limits on federal courts, especially when Congress is legislating on matters of foreign affairs and national security (*United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp.*). This originalist argument provides a distinct path for the Court to uphold the statute without disturbing its Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.\n\n*   **Centrality of *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.*:** My understanding of the relevant precedents has been significantly updated. The petitioners place immense weight on the Court's very recent decision in *Mallory* (2023). They argue that *Mallory*, which upheld a \"consent-by-registration\" statute, revitalized the doctrine that jurisdiction can be based on consent, separate and apart from the *International Shoe* \"minimum contacts\" test. The petitioners frame the Second Circuit's invention of a \"reciprocity\" or \"governmental benefit\" test as an extra-textual requirement that directly conflicts with *Mallory*'s logic. The PSJVTA, in their view, is a \"consent-by-conduct\" statute, and the defendants' actions (making payments to terrorists, conducting U.S. activities) constitute a valid basis for consent, just as registering to do business did in *Mallory*.\n\n*   **Alternative Argument within the Modern Framework:** The petitioners have a fallback argument. Even if the Court analyzes the case under the modern *International Shoe* framework, they contend the PSJVTA is constitutional. They invoke the \"fair warning\" principle from *Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct.*, arguing the statute provides exceptionally clear and specific warning to the PLO and PA that certain conduct will subject them to jurisdiction in U.S. courts for terrorism-related lawsuits.\n\n*   **The \"Perverse\" Logic of the Lower Court's Test:** The petition highlights a powerful logical flaw in the Second Circuit's reasoning, adopting Judge Menashi's dissent. The lower court's \"governmental benefit\" test creates a \"perverse\" outcome where a defendant engaging in *unlawful* conduct (paying terrorists for attacks on Americans) receives *greater* protection from jurisdiction than a defendant engaging in lawful, state-sanctioned conduct (registering to do business). This argument attacks the coherence and sensibility of the Second Circuit's judge-made rule.\n\nIn sum, my belief state has moved from a general understanding of the legal tension to a specific and structured knowledge of the petitioners' multi-pronged attack. The prediction now hinges on which of these arguments the Court finds most persuasive: (1) the broad, originalist argument distinguishing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) the narrower, precedent-based argument that *Mallory* controls and invalidates the Second Circuit's \"benefit\" test; or (3) the fallback argument that the statute's \"fair warning\" satisfies due process even under the *International Shoe* line of cases. The strength and recency of the *Mallory* precedent, combined with the compelling logical critique of the Second Circuit's test, significantly increases my belief that the Supreme Court will reverse the decision below.",

In \nthat role, one of his primary missions was to enact and \npursue policies that would lead to enduring peace in the \nMiddle East. Support for acts of terror in Gaza and the \nWest Bank by entities including the Palestine Libera-\ntion Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority \n(PA) is one of the primary obstacles to achieving peace \nin the region. As Secretary of State, Pompeo supported \nthe Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Ter-\nrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) as a commonsense solu-\ntion\u2014if entities like the PLO and PA promoted acts of \nterror while receiving American aid or maintaining facil-\nities in the United States, they should be subject to U.S. \nfederal court jurisdiction. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision undercuts Secretary \nPompeo\u2019s reasoned policy judgment that the PSJVTA \nadvances U.S. national security interests by providing a \nmechanism to impose real costs on terrorist organiza-\ntions, like the PLO and PA, that carry out or support \nterrorism. Those costs serve to, among other things, de-\nter the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, through which the \nPA furnishes terrorists and their families with monthly \nfinancial support. The PSJVTA incentivizes the PA to \nadjust its actions and behavior. Invalidating the \n \n1 Amicus states that this brief was not authored in whole or \nin part by counsel for any party, and that no person or entity \nother than amicus and his counsel made a monetary contribu-\ntion intended to fund the preparation or submission of this \nbrief. \n\n2 \n \nPSJVTA strips Congress and the Executive of a key tool \nin their fight to protect Americans abroad and to stabi-\nlize the Middle East. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nMore than 30 years ago, Congress and the Executive \nBranch chose to take a new approach to counter the in-\ncreasing rise of global terrorism. In passing the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1992 (\u201cATA\u201d), Congress established a \nstatutory scheme for the victims of international terror-\nism to obtain justice from perpetrators, no matter where \nthey are in the world. By so doing, Congress intended: \n[T]o bring terrorists to justice the American way, \nby using the framework of our legal system to \nseek justice against those who follow no frame-\nwork or defy all notions of morality and justice. It \nalso sends a strong warning to terrorists to keep \ntheir hands off Americans and an eye on their as-\nsets. \nAntiterrorism Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Sub-\ncomm. on Cts. & Admin. Prac. of the S. Comm. on the \nJudiciary, 101st Cong. 2\u20133 (1990) (statement of Sen. \nCharles Grassley, ATA co-sponsor) (\u201c1990 Hearing\u201d).  \nAnd that framework has succeeded: It has allowed \nvictims to obtain billions of dollars in damages as com-\npensation for terrorist attacks, and terrorist organiza-\ntions have been deprived of valuable funds that could \notherwise be used to perpetuate new acts of terror. See, \ne.g., Fain v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 885 F. Supp. 2d \n78, 80, 83 (D.D.C. 2012); Alejandre v. Republic of Cuba, \n996 F. Supp. 1239, 1242, 1253 (S.D. Fla. 1997).  \n\n3 \n \nHowever, starting in 2015\u2014despite the PLO and PA \nreceiving hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid \nfrom the United States\u2014U.S. courts began interpreting \nthe ATA in ways that insulate them from liability, hold-\ning the PLO and PA are not subject to personal jurisdic-\ntion. In response, Congress and the Executive worked \ntogether to pass the PSJVTA, which provides personal \njurisdiction over any foreign person or entity that gives \nmaterial support to terrorists who kill American citizens \nor undertakes certain activities within the United \nStates.  \nThe PSJVTA builds upon more than 30 years of con-\nsidered policy judgments by Congress and the Execu-\ntive in the field of counterterrorism\u2014a field the \nConstitution entrusts to the political branches. It is an \nimportant tool in the United States\u2019 counterterrorism \narsenal, which gives force to the ATA\u2019s promise to em-\npower victims of terror to seek justice. By establishing \ncriteria for determining when the PLO and PA have con-\nsented to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts\u2014based on \nchoices that are wholly within the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s con-\ntrol\u2014the PSJVTA helps hold the PLO and PA account-\nable for supporting violent acts against Americans and, \nin turn, provides powerful motivation for the PA to end \nits \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, a critical goal in the fight \nagainst terror. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. THE SECOND CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IN-\nVADES CONGRESS\u2019S AND THE EXECU-\nTIVE\u2019S AUTHORITIES TO COMBAT GLOBAL \nTERRORISM. \nThe Constitution commits to Congress and the Exec-\nutive the responsibilities and powers to determine the \ncountry\u2019s foreign policy and safeguard its national secu-\nrity. One of the most significant foreign policy and na-\ntional security priorities is the development of \ncounterterrorism policies that protect Americans at \nhome and abroad. The Second Circuit improperly tram-\nmeled these responsibilities and powers. It invalidated a \nconsidered policy scheme to counter global terrorism, \ncreated by a bipartisan coalition in Congress in coordi-\nnation with the Executive Branch. Its decision embold-\nens terrorist groups to continue plotting to harm \nAmericans free from punishment and leaves victims \nwithout a remedy for the \u201cunquestionably horrific\u201d \nharms perpetrated against them. See Pet. App. 52a. \nA. \nThe Constitution Delegates to Congress and \nthe Executive Alone the Responsibility and \nPower to Set the Nation\u2019s Counterterrorism \nPolicy. \nFor more than 100 years, this Court has held that the \n\u201cconduct of the foreign relations of our government is \ncommitted by the Constitution to the executive and leg-\nislative\u2014\u2018the political\u2019\u2014departments of the govern-\nment.\u201d Oetjen v. Cent. Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302 \n(1918); see also Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman \nS.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948) (\u201c[Foreign policy] \n\n5 \n \ndecisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the \npolitical departments of the government, Executive and \nLegislative.\u201d). This significant responsibility emanates \nnot from the \u201caffirmative grants of the Constitution,\u201d \nbut from the rights and powers invested in the United \nStates as \u201ca member of the family of nations.\u201d United \nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 \n(1936). \nForeign policy and national security decisions fall to \nthe political departments because decisions on these is-\nsues are \u201cdelicate\u201d and \u201ccomplex,\u201d and \u201cshould be under-\ntaken only by those directly responsible to the people \nwhose welfare they advance or imperil.\u201d Waterman S.S. \nCorp., 333 U.S. at 111.   \nAnd, of all the issues within the realm of foreign pol-\nicy and national security, countering global terrorism \u201cis \nan urgent objective of the highest order.\u201d Holder v. Hu-\nmanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010). Because \ncounterterrorism strategy is inherently delicate and \ncomplex, it requires Congress and the Executive to co-\noperate, not just to foil the planning and carrying out of \nthe violent attacks, but also to cut off the resources of \nthese groups to stamp them out. See id. at 30\u201332.  \nBy contrast, \u201cthe Judiciary has neither [the] apti-\ntude, facilities, nor responsibility,\u201d to handle counterter-\nrorism policy, Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. at 111, and \nit is well-established that the separation of powers re-\nquires that the judiciary not intrude into the political \nbranches\u2019 conduct of foreign affairs and national secu-\nrity, see Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210\u201311 (1962); see \nalso Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 589 (1952) \n(Matters relating \u201cto the conduct of foreign relations[] . \n\n6 \n \n. . are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches \nof government as to be largely immune from judicial in-\nquiry or interference.\u201d); Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, \n704 (2018) (the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinquiry [on issues of national \nsecurity] . . . is highly constrained\u201d). The judiciary may \nonly adjudicate questions of national security \u201ccon-\nsistent with a system of separated powers,\u201d Flast v. Co-\nhen, 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968). It may not sit as \u201coverseer\u201d \nof decisions expressly delegated to the other branches. \nDames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 660 (1981). \nB. \nThe PSJVTA represents the considered and \nreasoned policy judgments of Congress and \nthe Executive Branch. \nThe ATA and subsequent supplemental amendments \nand expansions, including the PSJVTA, are the work of \nthousands of hours of fact-gathering, analysis, and nego-\ntiation, by hundreds of experts across the federal gov-\nernment, and take into account a whole range of national \nsecurity interests implicated at home and abroad. While \nthe judiciary certainly has a role to play in checking the \nconstitutionality of federal government action, here, the \nSecond Circuit applied Fourteenth Amendment juris-\nprudence to Fifth Amendment considerations, see Pet. \nApp. 50a n.17 (citing Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 \nF.3d 45, 54 (D.C. Cir. 2017)), as a vehicle to question the \npolitical branches\u2019 considered judgments that the \nPSJVTA serves U.S. national security and counterter-\nrorism goals.  \nAmericans abroad have, since the 1970s and 1980s, \nfaced significant threats from terrorism abroad by dint \nof their nationality. 136 Cong. Rec. 7593\u201394 (1990) (state-\nment of ATA co-sponsor Sen. Howell Heflin). However, \n\n7 \n \nit was only in the late 1980s that Congress and the Ex-\necutive recognized that, not only did Americans face se-\nrious physical threats, but they also had little recourse \nagainst the perpetrators under existing U.S. law. On Oc-\ntober 7, 1985, four individuals hijacked the Italian cruise \nliner Achille Lauro in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea \nand executed elderly, wheel chair-bound Jewish-Ameri-\ncan passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, by throwing him and \nhis wheelchair overboard. According to reports, the sei-\nzure was undertaken at the behest of Abdul Abbas, a \npurported member of the PLO. See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. \nAchille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave Achille \nLauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria, 937 F.2d 44, \n47 (2d Cir. 1991). \nAt the time Mr. Klinghoffer was murdered, remedies \navailable to victims of the PLO and other global terrorist \ngroups were limited. Because Mr. Klinghoffer\u2019s murder \noccurred at sea, his widow was able to sue the PLO in \nthe United States under admiralty law. See Klinghoffer \nv. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave \nAchille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria \n(Klinghoffer I), 739 F. Supp. 854, 858\u201359 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) \n(applying the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n761\u2013768 (1982) (current version at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30301\u2013\n30308 (2006))), vacated, 937 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1991). How-\never, most terror victims from that era were left to pur-\nsue justice through ill-suited remedies like the Alien \nTort Claims Act. See, e.g., Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Re-\npublic, 726 F.2d 774 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (per curiam).  \nIt was for this reason that Congress and the Execu-\ntive worked together closely to create a private cause of \naction for victims of international terrorism in the ATA. \n\n8 \n \nSee 1990 Hearing at 3. The U.S. Department of State and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice agreed that the ATA \nwas a necessary tool in countering rising global terror-\nism. As State Department Legal Advisor Alan Kreczko \ntold the Senate Committee, the ATA was \u201ca useful addi-\ntion to the arsenal of legal tools for the fight against ter-\nrorism\u201d Id. at 12\u201313. Similarly, Deputy Assistant \nAttorney for the Civil Division Steven Valentine pushed \nCongress to approve the ATA, characterizing it as \u201ca \nsignificant new weapon against terrorists by providing a \nmeans of civil redress for those who have been harmed \nby terrorist acts,\u201d see id. at 25, and noting that it would \n\u201chave a deterrent effect on the commission of acts of in-\nternational terrorism against Americans,\u201d id. at 34. \nMost pertinent here, the political branches carefully \nconsidered the circumstances under which U.S. courts \nshould have jurisdiction over persons and entities that \nprovide material support for terrorism that kills Ameri-\ncan citizens. See id. at 12 (statement of Alan Kreczko) \n(\u201cThis bill . . . expands the Klinghoffer opinion.\u201d); 137 \nCong. Rec. 8143 (1991) (statement of Sen. Charles Grass-\nley) (noting that the ATA \u201cremoves the jurisdictional \nhurdles in the courts confronting victims [of interna-\ntional terrorism,] . . . codif[ies] [the Klinghoffer] ruling[,] \nand makes the right of American victims definitive.\u201d).  \nWhen Congress and the Executive came back to-\ngether after Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Organi-\nzation, 835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016), and Livnat v. \nPalestinian Authority, 851 F.3d 45 (D.C. Cir. 2017), to \npass the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 \n(ATCA) in the hopes of restoring federal court jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and PA, they chose to include a \n\n9 \n \nconsent provision, providing that entities consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in federal court by accepting certain \nforms of U.S. aid. Pub. L. No. 115-253, sec. 4(a), \u00a7 2334(e), \n132 Stat. 3183, 3184.  Congress noted that the consent \nprovision was based on a \u201creasonable and unambiguous \nchoice: if you accept U.S. foreign assistance and enter \nour nation\u2019s borders, you must do so on the condition not \nto support or take part in acts of international terrorism \nand that you compensate your victims if you breach that \npromise.\u201d See H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018) (\u201c2018 \nACTA H.R. Rep.\u201d).   \nThe PA, frightened by the prospect of millions of dol-\nlars in judgments against them (like the $655.5 million \noriginally awarded in this case), chose to stop accepting \nqualifying aid. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a, 62a. After that choice, \nthe Second Circuit held that the ATCA did not authorize \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and PA. Id. 10a \u201311a.  \nIn the aftermath of that decision, Congress and the \nExecutive again worked together to craft a reasoned \nremedy to U.S. courts\u2019 lack of personal jurisdiction: the \nPSJVTA. Letter from James Lankford & Charles Grass-\nley, Sens., to Antony Blinken, Sec\u2019y of State (Mar. 31, \n2021) (\u201cThe PSJVTA was the result of constructive \nwork between Congress and the State Department, re-\nflecting a bi-partisan agreement to reopen the court-\nhouse doors to American victims and their families, \nwhile permitting the restoration of humanitarian and se-\ncurity assistance to the Palestinians within the parame-\nters permitted by Congress.\u201d). In an official letter of \nsupport to Senator Grassley, Secretary Pompeo noted \nhis staff\u2019s collaboration with Senator Grassley\u2019s on de-\nvelopment of the bill, which \u201cadvances two critical U.S. \n\n10 \n \ninterests by seeking to enable U.S. victims of terrorism \nto vindicate their rights in U.S. courts while simultane-\nously protecting our own national security interests and \nthose of our close ally, Israel.\u201d Letter from Michael Pom-\npeo, Sec\u2019y of State, to Charles Grassley, Sen. (June 19, \n2019), Amicus App. 1a.  \nThe PSJVTA provides that if the PLO, PA, or any \nsuccessor or affiliate organization \u201cmakes any payment, \ndirectly or indirectly\u201d to a person jailed for committing \nan act of terrorism against an American national or to \ntheir family by reason of the terrorist act, or maintains a \nfacility or conducts any activity while physically present \nin the U.S. on behalf of the PLO or PA, it \u201cshall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in \nU.S. district courts. Further Consolidated Appropria-\ntions Act, 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, \n133 Stat. 2534, 3082 (2019) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(A)(i)\u2013(ii)). Simply put, if the PA chooses to con-\ntinue making these odious payments, thus encouraging \nmore terrorist attacks and putting more Americans at \nrisk, or otherwise seeks to advantage itself of resources \nin the United States, then, under the PSJVTA, it can be \nsued in U.S. courts. \nThe PJSVTA does not extend personal jurisdiction \nto non-resident defendants for the purposes of a contract \ndispute or business deal. It instead was drafted and \npassed to effectuate a critical foreign policy and national \nsecurity goal: deterring terrorism against Americans by \ncutting off the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s financial support for ter-\nrorists who kill or injure them. The exercise of personal \njurisdiction by federal courts over foreign funders of ter-\nror does not implicate the same due process concerns as \n\n11 \n \nhauling an out-of-state company into state court for a \ncommercial dispute. But, to the extent those concerns \nare raised, whether American foreign policy interests \njustify rejecting those concerns \u201cis a question that \nshould be addressed \u2018only by those directly responsible \nto the people whose welfare\u2019 such decisions \u2018advance or \nimperil.\u2019\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 284 \n(2018) (J. Gorsuch, concurring) (quoting Waterman S.S. \nCorp., 333 U.S. at 111). It was the reasoned judgment of \nthose actors\u2014Congress and Executive\u2014that the provi-\nsions of the PSJVTA, including the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nprovision, are best suited to effectuate the nation\u2019s coun-\nterterrorism policy objectives.  \nThe Second Circuit got it wrong in holding otherwise. \nThe panel\u2019s basis for striking down the statute was that \nthe activities identified by Congress as giving rise to \nconsent are activities \u201cnot targeted at the United \nStates\u201d and thus are insufficient to provide general or \nspecific jurisdiction. Pet. App. 26a. But, as Congress and \nthe Executive determined\u2014relying on resources \nuniquely available to those branches, but not to the judi-\nciary\u2014the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s support of terrorism need \nnot target the United States in order for the PLO and \nPA to reasonably foresee that its support of terrorism \ncould led to the murder of U.S. citizens, and in that way, \nbe directed at the United States. See 165 Cong. Rec. \nS7183 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2019) (\u201cThe PLO and Palestin-\nian Authority\u2019s \u2018pay to slay\u2019 policies are nothing short of \nan incitement for further acts of terrorism [against \nAmericans].\u201d). Likewise, Congress and the Executive \ndetermined, as it was their prerogative to do, that if the \nPLO and PA \u201center our nation\u2019s borders, [they] must do \n\n12 \n \nso on the condition not to support or take part in acts of \ninternational terrorism and [to] compensate [their] vic-\ntims if [they] breach that promise.\u201d 2018 ACTA H.R. \nRep. at 7. It is squarely within the ambit of the political \nbranches to set conditions upon the entry of foreign ter-\nrorist-affiliated entities to our country, and to stipulate \nthat doing so grants our courts jurisdiction to resolve \ndisputes regarding those conditions.\n2 \nII. \nINVALIDATING THE PSJVTA CRIPPLES \nCONGRESS\u2019S AND THE EXECUTIVE\u2019S \nABILITY TO EMPOWER VICTIMS OF TER-\nROR AND END THE BLOODY PAY-FOR-\nSLAY PROGRAM.  \nCongress and the Executive crafted the PSJVTA to \nbe a key tool i\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n73: 20250204150947903_CERTIFICATE20OF20WORD20COUNT2024-202024-15120amicus.json (score: 0.356)\nNos. 24-20 and 24-151 \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nMIRIAM FULD, ET AL., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL., \nRespondents. \n_________ \nUNITED STATES, \nPetitioner, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL., \nRespondents. \n \nCERTIFICATE OF WORD COUNT \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains 4,348 \nwords, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule \n33.1(d). \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on February 4, 2025. \n \n \n \n   /s/ Douglass Mitchell \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Douglass Mitchell\n\n",

In \nthat role, one of his primary missions was to enact and \npursue policies that would lead to enduring peace in the \nMiddle East. Support for acts of terror in Gaza and the \nWest Bank by entities including the Palestine Libera-\ntion Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority \n(PA) is one of the primary obstacles to achieving peace \nin the region. As Secretary of State, Pompeo supported \nthe Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Ter-\nrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) as a commonsense solu-\ntion\u2014if entities like the PLO and PA promoted acts of \nterror while receiving American aid or maintaining facil-\nities in the United States, they should be subject to U.S. \nfederal court jurisdiction. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision undercuts Secretary \nPompeo\u2019s reasoned policy judgment that the PSJVTA \nadvances U.S. national security interests by providing a \nmechanism to impose real costs on terrorist organiza-\ntions, like the PLO and PA, that carry out or support \nterrorism. Those costs serve to, among other things, de-\nter the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, through which the \nPA furnishes terrorists and their families with monthly \nfinancial support. The PSJVTA incentivizes the PA to \nadjust its actions and behavior. Invalidating the \n \n1 Amicus states that this brief was not authored in whole or \nin part by counsel for any party, and that no person or entity \nother than amicus and his counsel made a monetary contribu-\ntion intended to fund the preparation or submission of this \nbrief. \n\n2 \n \nPSJVTA strips Congress and the Executive of a key tool \nin their fight to protect Americans abroad and to stabi-\nlize the Middle East. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nMore than 30 years ago, Congress and the Executive \nBranch chose to take a new approach to counter the in-\ncreasing rise of global terrorism. In passing the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1992 (\u201cATA\u201d), Congress established a \nstatutory scheme for the victims of international terror-\nism to obtain justice from perpetrators, no matter where \nthey are in the world. By so doing, Congress intended: \n[T]o bring terrorists to justice the American way, \nby using the framework of our legal system to \nseek justice against those who follow no frame-\nwork or defy all notions of morality and justice. It \nalso sends a strong warning to terrorists to keep \ntheir hands off Americans and an eye on their as-\nsets. \nAntiterrorism Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Sub-\ncomm. on Cts. & Admin. Prac. of the S. Comm. on the \nJudiciary, 101st Cong. 2\u20133 (1990) (statement of Sen. \nCharles Grassley, ATA co-sponsor) (\u201c1990 Hearing\u201d).  \nAnd that framework has succeeded: It has allowed \nvictims to obtain billions of dollars in damages as com-\npensation for terrorist attacks, and terrorist organiza-\ntions have been deprived of valuable funds that could \notherwise be used to perpetuate new acts of terror. See, \ne.g., Fain v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 885 F. Supp. 2d \n78, 80, 83 (D.D.C. 2012); Alejandre v. Republic of Cuba, \n996 F. Supp. 1239, 1242, 1253 (S.D. Fla. 1997).  \n\n3 \n \nHowever, starting in 2015\u2014despite the PLO and PA \nreceiving hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid \nfrom the United States\u2014U.S. courts began interpreting \nthe ATA in ways that insulate them from liability, hold-\ning the PLO and PA are not subject to personal jurisdic-\ntion. In response, Congress and the Executive worked \ntogether to pass the PSJVTA, which provides personal \njurisdiction over any foreign person or entity that gives \nmaterial support to terrorists who kill American citizens \nor undertakes certain activities within the United \nStates.  \nThe PSJVTA builds upon more than 30 years of con-\nsidered policy judgments by Congress and the Execu-\ntive in the field of counterterrorism\u2014a field the \nConstitution entrusts to the political branches. It is an \nimportant tool in the United States\u2019 counterterrorism \narsenal, which gives force to the ATA\u2019s promise to em-\npower victims of terror to seek justice. By establishing \ncriteria for determining when the PLO and PA have con-\nsented to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts\u2014based on \nchoices that are wholly within the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s con-\ntrol\u2014the PSJVTA helps hold the PLO and PA account-\nable for supporting violent acts against Americans and, \nin turn, provides powerful motivation for the PA to end \nits \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, a critical goal in the fight \nagainst terror. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. THE SECOND CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION IN-\nVADES CONGRESS\u2019S AND THE EXECU-\nTIVE\u2019S AUTHORITIES TO COMBAT GLOBAL \nTERRORISM. \nThe Constitution commits to Congress and the Exec-\nutive the responsibilities and powers to determine the \ncountry\u2019s foreign policy and safeguard its national secu-\nrity. One of the most significant foreign policy and na-\ntional security priorities is the development of \ncounterterrorism policies that protect Americans at \nhome and abroad. The Second Circuit improperly tram-\nmeled these responsibilities and powers. It invalidated a \nconsidered policy scheme to counter global terrorism, \ncreated by a bipartisan coalition in Congress in coordi-\nnation with the Executive Branch. Its decision embold-\nens terrorist groups to continue plotting to harm \nAmericans free from punishment and leaves victims \nwithout a remedy for the \u201cunquestionably horrific\u201d \nharms perpetrated against them. See Pet. App. 52a. \nA. \nThe Constitution Delegates to Congress and \nthe Executive Alone the Responsibility and \nPower to Set the Nation\u2019s Counterterrorism \nPolicy. \nFor more than 100 years, this Court has held that the \n\u201cconduct of the foreign relations of our government is \ncommitted by the Constitution to the executive and leg-\nislative\u2014\u2018the political\u2019\u2014departments of the govern-\nment.\u201d Oetjen v. Cent. Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302 \n(1918); see also Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman \nS.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948) (\u201c[Foreign policy] \n\n5 \n \ndecisions are wholly confided by our Constitution to the \npolitical departments of the government, Executive and \nLegislative.\u201d). This significant responsibility emanates \nnot from the \u201caffirmative grants of the Constitution,\u201d \nbut from the rights and powers invested in the United \nStates as \u201ca member of the family of nations.\u201d United \nStates v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 \n(1936). \nForeign policy and national security decisions fall to \nthe political departments because decisions on these is-\nsues are \u201cdelicate\u201d and \u201ccomplex,\u201d and \u201cshould be under-\ntaken only by those directly responsible to the people \nwhose welfare they advance or imperil.\u201d Waterman S.S. \nCorp., 333 U.S. at 111.   \nAnd, of all the issues within the realm of foreign pol-\nicy and national security, countering global terrorism \u201cis \nan urgent objective of the highest order.\u201d Holder v. Hu-\nmanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010). Because \ncounterterrorism strategy is inherently delicate and \ncomplex, it requires Congress and the Executive to co-\noperate, not just to foil the planning and carrying out of \nthe violent attacks, but also to cut off the resources of \nthese groups to stamp them out. See id. at 30\u201332.  \nBy contrast, \u201cthe Judiciary has neither [the] apti-\ntude, facilities, nor responsibility,\u201d to handle counterter-\nrorism policy, Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. at 111, and \nit is well-established that the separation of powers re-\nquires that the judiciary not intrude into the political \nbranches\u2019 conduct of foreign affairs and national secu-\nrity, see Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210\u201311 (1962); see \nalso Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 589 (1952) \n(Matters relating \u201cto the conduct of foreign relations[] . \n\n6 \n \n. . are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches \nof government as to be largely immune from judicial in-\nquiry or interference.\u201d); Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, \n704 (2018) (the judiciary\u2019s \u201cinquiry [on issues of national \nsecurity] . . . is highly constrained\u201d). The judiciary may \nonly adjudicate questions of national security \u201ccon-\nsistent with a system of separated powers,\u201d Flast v. Co-\nhen, 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968). It may not sit as \u201coverseer\u201d \nof decisions expressly delegated to the other branches. \nDames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 660 (1981). \nB. \nThe PSJVTA represents the considered and \nreasoned policy judgments of Congress and \nthe Executive Branch. \nThe ATA and subsequent supplemental amendments \nand expansions, including the PSJVTA, are the work of \nthousands of hours of fact-gathering, analysis, and nego-\ntiation, by hundreds of experts across the federal gov-\nernment, and take into account a whole range of national \nsecurity interests implicated at home and abroad. While \nthe judiciary certainly has a role to play in checking the \nconstitutionality of federal government action, here, the \nSecond Circuit applied Fourteenth Amendment juris-\nprudence to Fifth Amendment considerations, see Pet. \nApp. 50a n.17 (citing Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 \nF.3d 45, 54 (D.C. Cir. 2017)), as a vehicle to question the \npolitical branches\u2019 considered judgments that the \nPSJVTA serves U.S. national security and counterter-\nrorism goals.  \nAmericans abroad have, since the 1970s and 1980s, \nfaced significant threats from terrorism abroad by dint \nof their nationality. 136 Cong. Rec. 7593\u201394 (1990) (state-\nment of ATA co-sponsor Sen. Howell Heflin). However, \n\n7 \n \nit was only in the late 1980s that Congress and the Ex-\necutive recognized that, not only did Americans face se-\nrious physical threats, but they also had little recourse \nagainst the perpetrators under existing U.S. law. On Oc-\ntober 7, 1985, four individuals hijacked the Italian cruise \nliner Achille Lauro in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea \nand executed elderly, wheel chair-bound Jewish-Ameri-\ncan passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, by throwing him and \nhis wheelchair overboard. According to reports, the sei-\nzure was undertaken at the behest of Abdul Abbas, a \npurported member of the PLO. See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. \nAchille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave Achille \nLauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria, 937 F.2d 44, \n47 (2d Cir. 1991). \nAt the time Mr. Klinghoffer was murdered, remedies \navailable to victims of the PLO and other global terrorist \ngroups were limited. Because Mr. Klinghoffer\u2019s murder \noccurred at sea, his widow was able to sue the PLO in \nthe United States under admiralty law. See Klinghoffer \nv. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave \nAchille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria \n(Klinghoffer I), 739 F. Supp. 854, 858\u201359 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) \n(applying the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n761\u2013768 (1982) (current version at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30301\u2013\n30308 (2006))), vacated, 937 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1991). How-\never, most terror victims from that era were left to pur-\nsue justice through ill-suited remedies like the Alien \nTort Claims Act. See, e.g., Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Re-\npublic, 726 F.2d 774 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (per curiam).  \nIt was for this reason that Congress and the Execu-\ntive worked together closely to create a private cause of \naction for victims of international terrorism in the ATA. \n\n8 \n \nSee 1990 Hearing at 3. The U.S. Department of State and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice agreed that the ATA \nwas a necessary tool in countering rising global terror-\nism. As State Department Legal Advisor Alan Kreczko \ntold the Senate Committee, the ATA was \u201ca useful addi-\ntion to the arsenal of legal tools for the fight against ter-\nrorism\u201d Id. at 12\u201313. Similarly, Deputy Assistant \nAttorney for the Civil Division Steven Valentine pushed \nCongress to approve the ATA, characterizing it as \u201ca \nsignificant new weapon against terrorists by providing a \nmeans of civil redress for those who have been harmed \nby terrorist acts,\u201d see id. at 25, and noting that it would \n\u201chave a deterrent effect on the commission of acts of in-\nternational terrorism against Americans,\u201d id. at 34. \nMost pertinent here, the political branches carefully \nconsidered the circumstances under which U.S. courts \nshould have jurisdiction over persons and entities that \nprovide material support for terrorism that kills Ameri-\ncan citizens. See id. at 12 (statement of Alan Kreczko) \n(\u201cThis bill . . . expands the Klinghoffer opinion.\u201d); 137 \nCong. Rec. 8143 (1991) (statement of Sen. Charles Grass-\nley) (noting that the ATA \u201cremoves the jurisdictional \nhurdles in the courts confronting victims [of interna-\ntional terrorism,] . . . codif[ies] [the Klinghoffer] ruling[,] \nand makes the right of American victims definitive.\u201d).  \nWhen Congress and the Executive came back to-\ngether after Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Organi-\nzation, 835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016), and Livnat v. \nPalestinian Authority, 851 F.3d 45 (D.C. Cir. 2017), to \npass the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 \n(ATCA) in the hopes of restoring federal court jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and PA, they chose to include a \n\n9 \n \nconsent provision, providing that entities consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in federal court by accepting certain \nforms of U.S. aid. Pub. L. No. 115-253, sec. 4(a), \u00a7 2334(e), \n132 Stat. 3183, 3184.  Congress noted that the consent \nprovision was based on a \u201creasonable and unambiguous \nchoice: if you accept U.S. foreign assistance and enter \nour nation\u2019s borders, you must do so on the condition not \nto support or take part in acts of international terrorism \nand that you compensate your victims if you breach that \npromise.\u201d See H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018) (\u201c2018 \nACTA H.R. Rep.\u201d).   \nThe PA, frightened by the prospect of millions of dol-\nlars in judgments against them (like the $655.5 million \noriginally awarded in this case), chose to stop accepting \nqualifying aid. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a, 62a. After that choice, \nthe Second Circuit held that the ATCA did not authorize \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and PA. Id. 10a \u201311a.  \nIn the aftermath of that decision, Congress and the \nExecutive again worked together to craft a reasoned \nremedy to U.S. courts\u2019 lack of personal jurisdiction: the \nPSJVTA. Letter from James Lankford & Charles Grass-\nley, Sens., to Antony Blinken, Sec\u2019y of State (Mar. 31, \n2021) (\u201cThe PSJVTA was the result of constructive \nwork between Congress and the State Department, re-\nflecting a bi-partisan agreement to reopen the court-\nhouse doors to American victims and their families, \nwhile permitting the restoration of humanitarian and se-\ncurity assistance to the Palestinians within the parame-\nters permitted by Congress.\u201d). In an official letter of \nsupport to Senator Grassley, Secretary Pompeo noted \nhis staff\u2019s collaboration with Senator Grassley\u2019s on de-\nvelopment of the bill, which \u201cadvances two critical U.S. \n\n10 \n \ninterests by seeking to enable U.S. victims of terrorism \nto vindicate their rights in U.S. courts while simultane-\nously protecting our own national security interests and \nthose of our close ally, Israel.\u201d Letter from Michael Pom-\npeo, Sec\u2019y of State, to Charles Grassley, Sen. (June 19, \n2019), Amicus App. 1a.  \nThe PSJVTA provides that if the PLO, PA, or any \nsuccessor or affiliate organization \u201cmakes any payment, \ndirectly or indirectly\u201d to a person jailed for committing \nan act of terrorism against an American national or to \ntheir family by reason of the terrorist act, or maintains a \nfacility or conducts any activity while physically present \nin the U.S. on behalf of the PLO or PA, it \u201cshall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in \nU.S. district courts. Further Consolidated Appropria-\ntions Act, 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, \n133 Stat. 2534, 3082 (2019) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(A)(i)\u2013(ii)). Simply put, if the PA chooses to con-\ntinue making these odious payments, thus encouraging \nmore terrorist attacks and putting more Americans at \nrisk, or otherwise seeks to advantage itself of resources \nin the United States, then, under the PSJVTA, it can be \nsued in U.S. courts. \nThe PJSVTA does not extend personal jurisdiction \nto non-resident defendants for the purposes of a contract \ndispute or business deal. It instead was drafted and \npassed to effectuate a critical foreign policy and national \nsecurity goal: deterring terrorism against Americans by \ncutting off the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s financial support for ter-\nrorists who kill or injure them. The exercise of personal \njurisdiction by federal courts over foreign funders of ter-\nror does not implicate the same due process concerns as \n\n11 \n \nhauling an out-of-state company into state court for a \ncommercial dispute. But, to the extent those concerns \nare raised, whether American foreign policy interests \njustify rejecting those concerns \u201cis a question that \nshould be addressed \u2018only by those directly responsible \nto the people whose welfare\u2019 such decisions \u2018advance or \nimperil.\u2019\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 284 \n(2018) (J. Gorsuch, concurring) (quoting Waterman S.S. \nCorp., 333 U.S. at 111). It was the reasoned judgment of \nthose actors\u2014Congress and Executive\u2014that the provi-\nsions of the PSJVTA, including the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nprovision, are best suited to effectuate the nation\u2019s coun-\nterterrorism policy objectives.  \nThe Second Circuit got it wrong in holding otherwise. \nThe panel\u2019s basis for striking down the statute was that \nthe activities identified by Congress as giving rise to \nconsent are activities \u201cnot targeted at the United \nStates\u201d and thus are insufficient to provide general or \nspecific jurisdiction. Pet. App. 26a. But, as Congress and \nthe Executive determined\u2014relying on resources \nuniquely available to those branches, but not to the judi-\nciary\u2014the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s support of terrorism need \nnot target the United States in order for the PLO and \nPA to reasonably foresee that its support of terrorism \ncould led to the murder of U.S. citizens, and in that way, \nbe directed at the United States. See 165 Cong. Rec. \nS7183 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2019) (\u201cThe PLO and Palestin-\nian Authority\u2019s \u2018pay to slay\u2019 policies are nothing short of \nan incitement for further acts of terrorism [against \nAmericans].\u201d). Likewise, Congress and the Executive \ndetermined, as it was their prerogative to do, that if the \nPLO and PA \u201center our nation\u2019s borders, [they] must do \n\n12 \n \nso on the condition not to support or take part in acts of \ninternational terrorism and [to] compensate [their] vic-\ntims if [they] breach that promise.\u201d 2018 ACTA H.R. \nRep. at 7. It is squarely within the ambit of the political \nbranches to set conditions upon the entry of foreign ter-\nrorist-affiliated entities to our country, and to stipulate \nthat doing so grants our courts jurisdiction to resolve \ndisputes regarding those conditions.\n2 \nII. \nINVALIDATING THE PSJVTA CRIPPLES \nCONGRESS\u2019S AND THE EXECUTIVE\u2019S \nABILITY TO EMPOWER VICTIMS OF TER-\nROR AND END THE BLOODY PAY-FOR-\nSLAY PROGRAM.  \nCongress and the Executive crafted the PSJVTA to \nbe a key tool in saving American lives by dismantling the \nPA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program. The program consists of \nmonthly payments by the PA to those imprisoned for \nterrorism, or to their families if they died committing the \nact. See Financially Rewarding Terrorism in the West \n \n2 The Second Circuit also questioned the prudence of choosing \nthe \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision as the mechanism to effect \nU.S. counterterrorism goals. While noting that Congress \nchose to use the PJSVTA to deter the \u201ccongressionally disfa-\nvored activity\u201d of funding foreign terrorist attacks against \nAmericans, the panel found that this policy objective would \nbe better effectuated by the \u201cvariety of other tools [that Con-\ngress has] at its disposal.\u201d Pet. App. 27a. The decision regard-\ning which \u201ctool\u201d is best suited to effectuating the foreign \npolicy and national security objectives of the country is, \nclearly, one committed to the political branches, not the judi-\nciary. \n\n13 \n \nBank: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Foreign Affs., \n114th Cong. 1\u20132 (2016) (statement of Edward Royce, \nChairman, H. Comm. on Foreign Affs.). These monthly \npayments provide powerful incentives for individuals to \ncommit acts of terror because they are \u201cmuch higher \nthan the average monthly wage in either Gaza or in the \nPalestinian-populated parts of Judea and Samaria.\u201d \nHugh Fitzgerald, The Palestinian Authority\u2019s Diaboli-\ncal \u2018Pay-for-Slay\u2019 Program, World Israel News (Jan. 27, \n2025), \nhttps://worldisraelnews.com/the-palestinian-au-\nthoritys-diabolical-pay-for-slay-program/. \nThe \npay-\nments incentivize and reward acts of terror, including \nthose directly responsible for the deaths of Americans, \nsuch as the more than thirty Americans murdered in last \nyear\u2019s October 7 attacks. Lindsay Whitehurst, The Jus-\ntice Department Is Investigating the Deaths and Kid-\nnappings of Americans in the Hamas Attack, AP News \n(Dec. 6, 2023, 1:23 PM), https://apnews.com/article/ha-\nmas-americans-killedkidnapped-justice-department-in-\nvestigation-64d851f794a6de4cbda40968dca50320. \nThe decision below vitiates Congress\u2019s and the Exec-\nutive\u2019s repeated efforts to protect U.S. national security \ninterests by giving victims the right to sue their victim-\nizer and cut off financial incentives to perpetrate brutal \nterrorist attacks against Americans. The decision below \nalso intrudes upon arenas of national security and for-\neign policy that are constitutionally reserved to Con-\ngress and the Executive by suggesting the judiciary \nknows of more effective \u201ctools\u201d to achieve those policy \ngoals. But Congress and the Executive have determined \nthere are no better mechanisms to do what the PSJVTA \ndoes; striking it down would be a great loss to U.S. \n\n14 \n \nefforts toward peace in the Middle East. This Court \nshould reverse the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, allowing \nthe political branches to resume their productive coun-\nterterrorism efforts. \nA. The PSJVTA is a keystone of Congress\u2019s and \nthe Executive\u2019s efforts to deter the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-\nfor-slay\u201d program and save American lives. \nCongress and the Executive have long recognized \nthat granting our courts jurisdiction for victim claims \nagainst terrorists is an indispensable tool in cutting off \nthe perverse incentives to kill Americans. As the legis-\nlative history makes clear, the PSJVTA is just the latest \npiece in a statutory scheme set up by Congress and the \nExecutive to stymie the pay-for-slay program by grant-\ning such jurisdiction.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s opinion hamstrings the govern-\nment\u2019s efforts to provide remedies for victims of terror-\nism. Congress and the Executive took decisive action to, \nonce again, empower victims of terror to seek justice by \nstarving the pay-for-slay program of the funds it relies \nupon. But lower courts have yet again stepped in to \nusurp the political branches\u2019 prerogative to protect our \nnational security. They have eliminated the only means \nof providing civil remedies to victims of terrorist attacks \nsponsored by the PLO and PA. Letting the opinion stand \nwould signal to the defendants that they can continue to \nfund terrorism without fear of facing justice before fed-\neral courts\u2014regardless of what Congress and the Exec-\nutive do. \n \n \n\n15 \n \nB. Holding the PLO and PA financially liable for \nsupporting terrorism is an indispensable means \nof discouraging further attacks and saving \nAmerican lives. \nEmpowering victims of terror to sue their victimiz-\ners is one of the most effective tools Congress and the \nExecutive have in their fight to end the pay-for-slay pro-\ngram and protect our national security. Subjecting the \nPA to U.S. jurisdiction was not an empty threat; Con-\ngress and the Executive knew the PA was sensitive to \nthe risk. Just one year prior to passing the PSJVTA, \nCongress enacted the ATCA, to which the PA re-\nsponded decisively\u2014they stopped accepting much of the \naid they received from the U.S. to avoid tripping the ju-\nrisdictional trigger. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a. Knowing this, the \nbill\u2019s drafters crafted the PSJVTA to induce the PA to \nstop the \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program. As Senator Grassley \nemphasized, \u201c[b]y cutting terrorists\u2019 financial lifelines, \nthe ATA is a key part of the U.S. arsenal in fighting ter-\nrorism and protecting American citizens.\u201d 165 Cong. \nRec. S7182 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2019). \nThe ATA has been effective for decades. Offering \nmonthly payments greater than local salaries is a pow-\nerful means of effectuating terrorism. But those pay-\nments are only possible if the defendants have funds to \ndisperse. In passing the ATCA, Congress recognized \nthat \u201cby cutting terrorists\u2019 financial lifelines, the \n[ATCA] furthers the United States\u2019 longstanding efforts \nto reduce global terrorism and thus protect Americans \nhere and abroad.\u201d 2018 ACTA H.R. Rep. at 3\u20134. The \nPSJVTA, like all legislation building on the ATA, simi-\nlarly seeks to cutoff the terrorists from their financial \n\n16 \n \nincentives and resources. This is not a novel idea. Sub-\njecting terrorist organizations to civil suit has long been \neffective in discouraging violent attacks. See Jack D. \nSmith & Gregory J. Cooper, Disrupting Terrorist Fi-\nnancing with Civil Litigation, 41 Case W. Res. J. Int\u2019l L. \n65, 77\u201379 (2009). Losing the PSJVTA means losing a \ntried-and-true way to disincentivize further terrorist at-\ntacks. \nThe current pause on its use has already wounded \nour national security by allowing the PA to continue \nmaking thousands of payments, rewarding violent ter-\nrorists that have attacked Americans. Just four months \nafter the Second Circuit curtailed courts\u2019 jurisdiction \nover the PLO and PA, the PA announced they would be \nmaking payments to over 23,000 new individuals and \ntheir families. The Ed. Bd., Palestinian \u2018Pay for Slay\u2019 \nKeeps Growing, Wall St. J. (Jan. 15, 2024, 6:38 PM). Over \n600 of those new payments will go to Hamas terrorists. \nId. Those who killed and injured American citizens will \nreceive financial rewards from the PA, while the PA will \nface no justice in U.S. courts if this Court does not step \nin. \nReversing the decision below and allowing the polit-\nical branches to protect our national security will save \nAmerican lives and advance the United States\u2019 national \nsecurity interests, as the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s efforts to \nevade federal jurisdiction make plain. One might think \nAmerican judgments against a foreign organization are \npractically hollow. But that is not the case here. It is em-\ninently clear that the PLO and PA expend substantial \ntime and resources attempting to avoid adverse judg-\nments in U.S. courts. There are various examples of the \n\n17 \n \nPLO and PA asking courts to reverse default judgments \nagainst them so they can litigate on the merits. See, e.g., \nUngar v. Palestine Liberation Org., 599 F.3d 79 (1st Cir. \n2010); Knox v. Palestine Liberation Org., 248 F.R.D. 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2008). These organizations\u2019 fervent desire to \navoid U.S. judgments demonstrates the PSJVTA is an \neffective tool to disincentivize terrorism against Ameri-\ncans.  \nBy obstructing the PSJVTA, the decision below risks \ngiving the PLO and PA the go-ahead to continue funding \nacts of terror abroad that foreseeably lead to violence \nagainst Americans. See The Ed. Bd., Palestinian \u2018Pay \nfor Slay\u2019 Keeps Growing, supra. This Court should in-\nstead resolve the issue and support the objectives of \nboth Congress and the Executive in enacting the \nPSJVTA: to subject the PLO, PA, and any other terror \norganizations to federal jurisdiction and, in doing so, halt \nthe funding of terrorism perpetrated against Americans. \nIf the decision below stands, terrorist groups can \nmurder or injure U.S. citizens around the world with no \nrecourse unless the group creates substantial connec-\ntions with the U.S. But it is difficult to imagine what con-\ntacts such a terrorist group would plausibly make with \nthe U.S., above and beyond the substantial connections \nalleged by plaintiffs\u2014that the PLO and PA (1) imple-\nment policies like the pay-for-slay program that result in \nthe murder of Americans with reasonable foreseeability, \nand (2) undertook certain activities in the United States. \nThese connections are, in the political branches\u2019 rea-\nsoned judgments, precisely the kind of activities that \nprovide a constitutionally sufficient basis for defining \n\u201cpay-for-slay\u201d as consent to personal jurisdiction in \n\n18 \n \nUnited States courts.  \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, amicus respectfully urges this Court to \nreverse the decision of the court of appeals below, uphold \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA, and instruct that the \nPLO and PA constitutionally consented to personal juris-\ndiction in the district court. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nANDRIANNA D.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation was an internal thought process, a strategic reflection on the information needed to form a complete prediction. It did not introduce new external facts, arguments, or evidence regarding the case itself. Therefore, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable, grounded in the detailed analysis of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n\nMy current understanding of the case is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Legal Framing:** My belief that the core of the petitioners' case rests on a multi-pronged attack remains unchanged. This includes:\n    1.  **An Originalist Distinction:** The argument that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause (constraining the federal government) does not impose the same territorial \"minimum contacts\" limitations as the Fourteenth Amendment (constraining states), especially when Congress is legislating on foreign affairs and national security.\n    2.  **A Precedent-Based Challenge:** The assertion that the Supreme Court's recent decision in *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* directly controls this case. Petitioners argue *Mallory* affirmed jurisdiction based on consent (in that case, by registering to do business) as a distinct basis from the *International Shoe* framework, thereby invalidating the Second Circuit's invention of a \"reciprocity\" or \"governmental benefit\" test for consent.\n    3.  **A Fallback \"Fair Warning\" Argument:** The alternative claim that even under the modern *International Shoe* framework, the PSJVTA provides such explicit and specific \"fair warning\" to the PLO and PA that it satisfies due process.\n\n*   **Stable Understanding of Key Precedents:** The centrality of *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* to the petitioners' strategy is a firm belief. They are framing the PSJVTA as a \"consent-by-conduct\" statute directly analogous to the \"consent-by-registration\" statute upheld in *Mallory*.\n\n*   **Stable Critique of the Lower Court:** The powerful logical critique of the Second Circuit's ruling, based on Judge Menashi's dissent, remains a key element of my understanding. The argument that the lower court's test creates a \"perverse\" outcome\u2014whereby unlawful conduct (paying terrorists) is afforded greater jurisdictional protection than lawful conduct (registering a business)\u2014is a compelling point that the Supreme Court will likely have to address.\n\n*   **Acknowledged Uncertainty:** The observation reinforces my awareness of a significant gap in my knowledge. My current beliefs are shaped almost entirely by the petitioners' arguments. To develop a balanced and robust prediction, I must acquire and analyze the counterarguments. The observation correctly identifies the next essential pieces of evidence: the respondents' (PLO and PA) Brief in Opposition, which will directly confront the petitioners' claims, and the brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, whose position on the interplay between congressional power, foreign policy, and due process will be highly influential for the Court. My prediction remains tentative until these opposing viewpoints can be integrated.",

My current state explicitly notes the SG's position as a critical uncertainty, especially given the Pompeo brief representing a *former* administration's view.\n\nTask EIG is maximal (1.0) because the SG's brief will cause a massive update to my predictive model, regardless of its content. If the SG supports the petitioners, it creates a powerful united front of the political branches, making the foreign policy deference argument nearly dispositive. If the SG supports the respondents, it creates an executive branch split, forcing the Court to engage with the complex jurisdictional precedents and significantly increasing the respondents' chances. A middle-ground position would introduce entirely new potential outcomes. Resolving this uncertainty is the single most impactful step I can take right now to refine my prediction for this specific case.\n\nDesign EIG is very high (0.8) because the SG's brief is a cornerstone of general SCOTUS prediction strategy. This case offers a unique opportunity to model the Court's reaction to a potential conflict between the current and a former administration on a matter of foreign policy and national security. Observing how the SG frames the issue and how the Court ultimately responds will provide invaluable, generalizable data on the weight given to the SG's views in such complex and politically sensitive circumstances.

Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. \nRev. 1703 (2020) ........................................ \n22 \n\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica (\u201cChamber\u201d) is the world\u2019s largest business \nfederation. The Chamber represents approximately \n300,000 direct members and indirectly represents the \ninterests of more than three million companies and \nprofessional organizations of every size, in every \nindustry sector, and from every region of the country. \nAn important function of the Chamber is to represent \nthe interests of its members in matters before \nCongress, the Executive Branch, and the courts. \nThe Chamber unequivocally condemns acts of \nterrorism in all forms, including those committed \nagainst American citizens at issue in this case.  \nRespondents should be \u2013 and are \u2013 answerable in \nUnited States Courts for the \u201cpay for slay\u201d policy that \nPetitioners describe, that the political branches seek to \naddress, and that the Chamber finds abhorrent.  See \nPetn. for Cert. at 13, Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n(No. 24-20) (U.S. July 3, 2024).  Specifically, Respondents \nare subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the \nUnited States Courts for their actions, and the \nexercise of that jurisdiction does not offend the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nWhile that is the topline conclusion, the basis upon \nwhich this Court reaches that conclusion carries \nimportant implications for the American business \ncommunity.  American businesses rely on predictable \nrules governing personal jurisdiction.  Those rules \nprovide essential guidance about where disputes can \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus, its members, or \nits counsel, made any monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nbe heard whether in matters where American busi-\nnesses are seeking relief or named as defendants. \nConsistent with those interests, the Chamber has \nparticipated in many cases lying at the intersection  \nof foreign affairs and the constitutional limits on a \ncourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Such cases \ninclude CC/Devas (Multimedia) Ltd. v. Antrix Corp., \nLtd., (No. 23-1201) (\u201cDevas\u201d) and J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011).  Following its \npositions articulated in those and other cases, the \nChamber files this brief to offer its unique perspective \non how to resolve this case in a manner that takes into \nconsideration the broader implications of any rule of \ndecision. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Chamber agrees with the United States that \nthis Court should decide this \ncase narrowly,  \nwithout addressing broad questions of how the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause restrains federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 47.  \nBoth petitions concern a facial challenge to a unique \nfederal statute specifically designed to overcome \njurisprudential impediments to the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority \n(\u201cPA\u201d) and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO,\u201d and together with the PA, \u201cRespondents\u201d) in \ncases involving acts of terrorism against United States \nnationals.  The sole question presented is whether the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction against Respondents \npursuant to the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. 116-94, div. \nJ., tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), \n\n3 \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d \nThe straightforward reason is that Respondents are \nnot entitled to the protections of the Due Process \nClause.  As the Chamber has explained in its brief in \nDevas, due process protections do not extend to foreign \nsovereign governments or their alter egos.  Although \nPalestine is not a foreign sovereign, the reasons \nadvanced in the Chamber\u2019s brief in Devas support the \nsame conclusion for Respondents.  For decades, the \nExecutive Branch has taken this view and concluded \nthat foreign political entities, including Respondents \nspecifically, are not entitled to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nprotections.  Nothing in the decision below offers a \npersuasive reason to depart from the Executive \nBranch\u2019s historical position.  This reason alone is \nsufficient to resolve these appeals in Petitioners\u2019 favor \nand to reverse the judgment below. \nThe Court should go no further.  It is not necessary \nin this case to examine the precise relationship \nbetween the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment limits \non personal jurisdiction.  That question involves difficult \nmethodological debates with significant repercussions \nthat cannot be fully fleshed out here.  If this Court \nnevertheless opts to delve into that question, it should \nformally adopt the approach suggested by this Court \nin Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, \n619 (1992), and the plurality opinion in Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, and consistently employed by the federal \nappellate courts:  the Fifth Amendment requires that \na defendant have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole.  Sound reasons counsel against a \nmore radical approach never embraced by this Court \nor any federal appellate court, that the Fifth Amendment \nonly affords defendants the process authorized by \n\n4 \nCongress and imposes no independent limits on the \npersonal jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nLikewise, it is not necessary to examine whether the \nconsent doctrine might support the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion.  The judges dissenting from rehearing en banc \nsuggested that this Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), might \nbe read to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nbased on the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions.  \nPet. App. 246a-248a, 309a-310a.  But Mallory did not \ngrant Congress (or state legislatures) a blank check to \nequate any activity with a blanket consent to all-\npurpose jurisdiction.  See Gov\u2019t Br. at 24 (\u201cThat does \nnot mean anything goes.\u201d) (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. \nMontana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 362 \n(2021)).  And the unique context of this statute makes \nthis case a far from ideal vehicle to begin defining the \ncontours of that doctrine post Mallory. \nIn sum, this Court can and should take the straight-\nforward route to resolving this case.  Respondents, like \nStates of the Union and foreign sovereign govern-\nments, are not entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause.  This Court thus need not consider the \ndownstream question whether an entity entitled to the \nprotections of that Clause could be subjected to \npersonal jurisdiction under the statute as a matter of \ncontacts or consent.  The exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion over these Respondents pursuant to this statute \ncomports with the Constitution.   \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \nARGUMENT \nAny exercise of personal jurisdiction requires proof \nof three propositions.  First, \u201cthe procedural requirement \nof service of summons must be satisfied.\u201d  Omni \nCapital Intern., Ltd. v. Wolff & Co. Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1987)   Second, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nrequires a statutory authorization.  Keeton v. Hustler \nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774-75 (1984).  Third, any \nstatutory authorization of personal jurisdiction must \ncomport with the Constitution.   \nAs the courts below correctly recognized, only the \nthird requirement is at issue here.  Respondents have \nbeen properly served, and the PSJVTA authorizes \npersonal jurisdiction over these Respondents.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.   \nThe court below framed its assessment of the \nconstitutional question by reference to three categories:  \ngeneral jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction and consent.  \nThat framing elided a critical antecedent issue, \nnamely, whether Respondents were entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause at all.  See  \nPet. App. 153a-154a. They are not.  For this reason \nalone, the constitutional inquiry ends.  Further \nexamination of the three above-referenced categories \nis not necessary.   \nI. Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue process under the Fifth Amendment . \n\u201cForeign states\u201d are not persons entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Chamber Br. at 4-25, Devas (No. 23-\n1201) (U.S. Dec. 11, 2024).  This rule can easily be \nextended to foreign political entities like Respondents.  \nSee Gov\u2019t Br. at 19 (\u201c[R]espondents\u2019 status as non-\nsovereign foreign entities weighs strongly in favor of \n\n6 \nthe [PSJVTA\u2019s] constitutionality.\u201d).  Considerations of \ntext, history, and precedent all support this conclusion. \nText.  While the Constitution does not define the \nterm \u201cperson,\u201d the use of the term throughout the \ndocument reveals that the Framers did not intend for \nit to encompass certain governmental entities, including \n\u201cforeign states\u201d (U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9; id. art. III, \u00a7 2; \nid. amend. XI), \u201cforeign nations,\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 8) \u201cforeign \nPower[s],\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 10), and \u201cStates\u201d of the Union \n(id. art. I, \u00a7 8; id. amend XIV).  The repeated and \ndeliberate use of these terms throughout the \nConstitution to refer to governmental bodies demands \nthe conclusion that, had the Framers intended for the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s protections to extend to these \ncategories of litigants, it would have include such \nterms (along with \u201cpersons\u201d) among the parties \nentitled to the protections set forth therein. Compare \nid. amend. V, with id. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 10, id. art. III, \u00a72, \nid. amend. XI, and id. amend XIV.  \nThis conclusion comports with the commonly held \nbelief that the Constitution was not intended to \nprotect governments, especially foreign ones.  As one \nscholar succinctly summarized the point: \u201cthe opposite \nof a constitutional right is a government power.\u201d  Kent \nGreenfield, In Defense of Corporate Persons, 30 Const. \nComment. 309, 316 (2015).  It would therefore \u201cbe \nquite strange to interpret the Due Process Clause as \nconferring upon [Respondents] rights and protections \nagainst the power of federal government.\u201d Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). \nBecause the Fifth Amendment seeks to protect \npersons from the exercise of an unlawful government \npower, foreign political entities \u2013 regardless of \n\n7 \nsovereignty status \u2013 are not, as a textual matter, \nentitled to its protection. \nHistory. What text suggests, history confirms.  For \nfifty years, the Executive Branch has been steadfast in \nits pronouncement that the Constitution was not \nintended to apply to entities like Respondents.  In \n1975, Attorney General Levi testified that because the \npreamble of the Constitution refers to \u201cWe the People,\u201d \nit could \u201cbe urged that it was not meant to apply to \nforeign nations, their agents and collaborators.\u201d \nIntelligence Activities \u2013 The National Security Agency \nand Fourth Amendment Rights: Hearings on S. Res. 21 \nBefore the Senate Select Committee to Study \nGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence \nActivities, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 66, 74 (1975) \n(statement of Attorney General Edward H. Levi).  Five \nyears later, the Office of Legal Counsel sought to \nclarify the distinction between a foreign individual \nand a foreign government, explaining that the former \nmay have Fifth Amendment rights, whereas the latter \ndoes not. See Presidential Authority to Settle the \nIranian Crisis, 4A Op. O.L.C. 248, 260 n.9 (1980) (\u201cA \nforeign nation [ ], unlike a foreign national, does not \nhave rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). \nIn 1987, the Office of Legal Counsel directly spoke to \nthe constitutional rights of the PLO in the face of the \nfederal government\u2019s decision to close the Palestine \nInformation Office. The opinion declared that the  \n\u201cPLO [ ], as a foreign political entity, has no \nconstitutional rights,\u201d and that this conclusion \u201cflows \ninexorably from the nature of foreign sovereigns and \ntheir interaction with the United States as a foreign, \nco-equal sovereign.\u201d Constitutionality of Closing the \nPalestine Info. Off., an Affiliate of the Palestine \nLiberation Org., 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 106 (1987). \u201cSimply \n\n8 \nput, a foreign political entity such as the PLO, \u2018lies \noutside the structure of the union.\u2019\u201d Id. at 107 (citing \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 \n(1934)).  It \u201c[has undertaken] no general obligation to \nabide by the constitutional norms to which the federal \ngovernment and the several states are subject, nor are \nthere any effective means to place [it] on parity with \nthe United States or the states for purposes of \nenforcement of particular norms.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 107 \n(internal citations omitted). \nRecognizing that \u201cthe PLO is not a sovereign \nnation,\u201d the Executive Branch further dispensed with \nany suggestion that this lack of status would \u201cbring it \nwithin the constitutional fold.\u201d Id. at 120 n.7.  The \nExecutive Branch explained, \u201c[a]lthough the United \nStates chooses not to recognize the PLO as [a \nsovereign state], the PLO nonetheless interacts with \nthe United States as a foreign political entity within \nthe structure of international law,\u201d and \u201cis reported to \nhave diplomatic relations with approximately\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. \nRev. 1703 (2020) ........................................ \n22 \n\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica (\u201cChamber\u201d) is the world\u2019s largest business \nfederation. The Chamber represents approximately \n300,000 direct members and indirectly represents the \ninterests of more than three million companies and \nprofessional organizations of every size, in every \nindustry sector, and from every region of the country. \nAn important function of the Chamber is to represent \nthe interests of its members in matters before \nCongress, the Executive Branch, and the courts. \nThe Chamber unequivocally condemns acts of \nterrorism in all forms, including those committed \nagainst American citizens at issue in this case.  \nRespondents should be \u2013 and are \u2013 answerable in \nUnited States Courts for the \u201cpay for slay\u201d policy that \nPetitioners describe, that the political branches seek to \naddress, and that the Chamber finds abhorrent.  See \nPetn. for Cert. at 13, Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n(No. 24-20) (U.S. July 3, 2024).  Specifically, Respondents \nare subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the \nUnited States Courts for their actions, and the \nexercise of that jurisdiction does not offend the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nWhile that is the topline conclusion, the basis upon \nwhich this Court reaches that conclusion carries \nimportant implications for the American business \ncommunity.  American businesses rely on predictable \nrules governing personal jurisdiction.  Those rules \nprovide essential guidance about where disputes can \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus, its members, or \nits counsel, made any monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nbe heard whether in matters where American busi-\nnesses are seeking relief or named as defendants. \nConsistent with those interests, the Chamber has \nparticipated in many cases lying at the intersection  \nof foreign affairs and the constitutional limits on a \ncourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Such cases \ninclude CC/Devas (Multimedia) Ltd. v. Antrix Corp., \nLtd., (No. 23-1201) (\u201cDevas\u201d) and J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011).  Following its \npositions articulated in those and other cases, the \nChamber files this brief to offer its unique perspective \non how to resolve this case in a manner that takes into \nconsideration the broader implications of any rule of \ndecision. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Chamber agrees with the United States that \nthis Court should decide this \ncase narrowly,  \nwithout addressing broad questions of how the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause restrains federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 47.  \nBoth petitions concern a facial challenge to a unique \nfederal statute specifically designed to overcome \njurisprudential impediments to the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority \n(\u201cPA\u201d) and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO,\u201d and together with the PA, \u201cRespondents\u201d) in \ncases involving acts of terrorism against United States \nnationals.  The sole question presented is whether the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction against Respondents \npursuant to the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. 116-94, div. \nJ., tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), \n\n3 \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d \nThe straightforward reason is that Respondents are \nnot entitled to the protections of the Due Process \nClause.  As the Chamber has explained in its brief in \nDevas, due process protections do not extend to foreign \nsovereign governments or their alter egos.  Although \nPalestine is not a foreign sovereign, the reasons \nadvanced in the Chamber\u2019s brief in Devas support the \nsame conclusion for Respondents.  For decades, the \nExecutive Branch has taken this view and concluded \nthat foreign political entities, including Respondents \nspecifically, are not entitled to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nprotections.  Nothing in the decision below offers a \npersuasive reason to depart from the Executive \nBranch\u2019s historical position.  This reason alone is \nsufficient to resolve these appeals in Petitioners\u2019 favor \nand to reverse the judgment below. \nThe Court should go no further.  It is not necessary \nin this case to examine the precise relationship \nbetween the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment limits \non personal jurisdiction.  That question involves difficult \nmethodological debates with significant repercussions \nthat cannot be fully fleshed out here.  If this Court \nnevertheless opts to delve into that question, it should \nformally adopt the approach suggested by this Court \nin Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, \n619 (1992), and the plurality opinion in Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, and consistently employed by the federal \nappellate courts:  the Fifth Amendment requires that \na defendant have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole.  Sound reasons counsel against a \nmore radical approach never embraced by this Court \nor any federal appellate court, that the Fifth Amendment \nonly affords defendants the process authorized by \n\n4 \nCongress and imposes no independent limits on the \npersonal jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nLikewise, it is not necessary to examine whether the \nconsent doctrine might support the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion.  The judges dissenting from rehearing en banc \nsuggested that this Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), might \nbe read to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nbased on the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions.  \nPet. App. 246a-248a, 309a-310a.  But Mallory did not \ngrant Congress (or state legislatures) a blank check to \nequate any activity with a blanket consent to all-\npurpose jurisdiction.  See Gov\u2019t Br. at 24 (\u201cThat does \nnot mean anything goes.\u201d) (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. \nMontana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 362 \n(2021)).  And the unique context of this statute makes \nthis case a far from ideal vehicle to begin defining the \ncontours of that doctrine post Mallory. \nIn sum, this Court can and should take the straight-\nforward route to resolving this case.  Respondents, like \nStates of the Union and foreign sovereign govern-\nments, are not entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause.  This Court thus need not consider the \ndownstream question whether an entity entitled to the \nprotections of that Clause could be subjected to \npersonal jurisdiction under the statute as a matter of \ncontacts or consent.  The exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion over these Respondents pursuant to this statute \ncomports with the Constitution.   \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \nARGUMENT \nAny exercise of personal jurisdiction requires proof \nof three propositions.  First, \u201cthe procedural requirement \nof service of summons must be satisfied.\u201d  Omni \nCapital Intern., Ltd. v. Wolff & Co. Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1987)   Second, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nrequires a statutory authorization.  Keeton v. Hustler \nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774-75 (1984).  Third, any \nstatutory authorization of personal jurisdiction must \ncomport with the Constitution.   \nAs the courts below correctly recognized, only the \nthird requirement is at issue here.  Respondents have \nbeen properly served, and the PSJVTA authorizes \npersonal jurisdiction over these Respondents.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.   \nThe court below framed its assessment of the \nconstitutional question by reference to three categories:  \ngeneral jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction and consent.  \nThat framing elided a critical antecedent issue, \nnamely, whether Respondents were entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause at all.  See  \nPet. App. 153a-154a. They are not.  For this reason \nalone, the constitutional inquiry ends.  Further \nexamination of the three above-referenced categories \nis not necessary.   \nI. Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue process under the Fifth Amendment . \n\u201cForeign states\u201d are not persons entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Chamber Br. at 4-25, Devas (No. 23-\n1201) (U.S. Dec. 11, 2024).  This rule can easily be \nextended to foreign political entities like Respondents.  \nSee Gov\u2019t Br. at 19 (\u201c[R]espondents\u2019 status as non-\nsovereign foreign entities weighs strongly in favor of \n\n6 \nthe [PSJVTA\u2019s] constitutionality.\u201d).  Considerations of \ntext, history, and precedent all support this conclusion. \nText.  While the Constitution does not define the \nterm \u201cperson,\u201d the use of the term throughout the \ndocument reveals that the Framers did not intend for \nit to encompass certain governmental entities, including \n\u201cforeign states\u201d (U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9; id. art. III, \u00a7 2; \nid. amend. XI), \u201cforeign nations,\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 8) \u201cforeign \nPower[s],\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 10), and \u201cStates\u201d of the Union \n(id. art. I, \u00a7 8; id. amend XIV).  The repeated and \ndeliberate use of these terms throughout the \nConstitution to refer to governmental bodies demands \nthe conclusion that, had the Framers intended for the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s protections to extend to these \ncategories of litigants, it would have include such \nterms (along with \u201cpersons\u201d) among the parties \nentitled to the protections set forth therein. Compare \nid. amend. V, with id. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 10, id. art. III, \u00a72, \nid. amend. XI, and id. amend XIV.  \nThis conclusion comports with the commonly held \nbelief that the Constitution was not intended to \nprotect governments, especially foreign ones.  As one \nscholar succinctly summarized the point: \u201cthe opposite \nof a constitutional right is a government power.\u201d  Kent \nGreenfield, In Defense of Corporate Persons, 30 Const. \nComment. 309, 316 (2015).  It would therefore \u201cbe \nquite strange to interpret the Due Process Clause as \nconferring upon [Respondents] rights and protections \nagainst the power of federal government.\u201d Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). \nBecause the Fifth Amendment seeks to protect \npersons from the exercise of an unlawful government \npower, foreign political entities \u2013 regardless of \n\n7 \nsovereignty status \u2013 are not, as a textual matter, \nentitled to its protection. \nHistory. What text suggests, history confirms.  For \nfifty years, the Executive Branch has been steadfast in \nits pronouncement that the Constitution was not \nintended to apply to entities like Respondents.  In \n1975, Attorney General Levi testified that because the \npreamble of the Constitution refers to \u201cWe the People,\u201d \nit could \u201cbe urged that it was not meant to apply to \nforeign nations, their agents and collaborators.\u201d \nIntelligence Activities \u2013 The National Security Agency \nand Fourth Amendment Rights: Hearings on S. Res. 21 \nBefore the Senate Select Committee to Study \nGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence \nActivities, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 66, 74 (1975) \n(statement of Attorney General Edward H. Levi).  Five \nyears later, the Office of Legal Counsel sought to \nclarify the distinction between a foreign individual \nand a foreign government, explaining that the former \nmay have Fifth Amendment rights, whereas the latter \ndoes not. See Presidential Authority to Settle the \nIranian Crisis, 4A Op. O.L.C. 248, 260 n.9 (1980) (\u201cA \nforeign nation [ ], unlike a foreign national, does not \nhave rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). \nIn 1987, the Office of Legal Counsel directly spoke to \nthe constitutional rights of the PLO in the face of the \nfederal government\u2019s decision to close the Palestine \nInformation Office. The opinion declared that the  \n\u201cPLO [ ], as a foreign political entity, has no \nconstitutional rights,\u201d and that this conclusion \u201cflows \ninexorably from the nature of foreign sovereigns and \ntheir interaction with the United States as a foreign, \nco-equal sovereign.\u201d Constitutionality of Closing the \nPalestine Info. Off., an Affiliate of the Palestine \nLiberation Org., 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 106 (1987). \u201cSimply \n\n8 \nput, a foreign political entity such as the PLO, \u2018lies \noutside the structure of the union.\u2019\u201d Id. at 107 (citing \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 \n(1934)).  It \u201c[has undertaken] no general obligation to \nabide by the constitutional norms to which the federal \ngovernment and the several states are subject, nor are \nthere any effective means to place [it] on parity with \nthe United States or the states for purposes of \nenforcement of particular norms.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 107 \n(internal citations omitted). \nRecognizing that \u201cthe PLO is not a sovereign \nnation,\u201d the Executive Branch further dispensed with \nany suggestion that this lack of status would \u201cbring it \nwithin the constitutional fold.\u201d Id. at 120 n.7.  The \nExecutive Branch explained, \u201c[a]lthough the United \nStates chooses not to recognize the PLO as [a \nsovereign state], the PLO nonetheless interacts with \nthe United States as a foreign political entity within \nthe structure of international law,\u201d and \u201cis reported to \nhave diplomatic relations with approximately one \nhundred countries throughout the world.\u201d Id. at 119-\n20 (citing G.A. Res. 3237, 29 U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., \nSupp. No. 31, at 4, U.N. Doc. A/9631 (1974)). The same \nis true for the PA, which was created by treaty under \nthe Gaza-Jericho Agreement and Oslo Accords to act \nas the interim civil government of defined territory.  \nPet. App. 6a, 61a;  Declaration of Principles on Interim \nSelf\u2013Government Arrangements (\u201cOslo I\u201d) art III, Sept. \n19, 1993, Isr.-P.L.O., 32 I.L.M. 1525, 1529-30 (1993); \nAgreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area \n(\u201cGaza-Jericho Agreement\u201d), May 4, 1994, Isr.-P.L.O., \n33 I.L.M. 622, 626 (1994); Interim Agreement on the \nWest Bank & the Gaza Strip (\u201cOslo II\u201d) art I, Sept. 28, \n1995, Isr.-P.L.O., 36 I.L.M. 551, 559 (acknowledging \n\u201cPalestinian Authority [as] established in accordance \nwith the Gaza-Jericho Agreement\u201d). Because the Oslo \n\n9 \nAccords constrain the PA\u2019s authority within the \nidentified territory, the PLO conducts foreign affairs \non behalf of the Palestinian People and is a Permanent \nObserver to the United Nations. Pet. App. 6a, 61a; Oslo \nII art IX, 36 I.L.M. at 561.  Respondents may therefore \nbe subjected to the exercise of the federal government\u2019s \n\u201cnecessary and inherent power to preclude foreign \nencroachment.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 120. As a result, the \nExecutive Branch concluded that \u201c[t]he PLO qua PLO, \n[a]s a foreign political entity, does not itself enjoy \nconstitutional protection.\u201d Id. \nConsistent with Attorney General Levi\u2019s testimony \nand the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s opinions, the United \nStates has appeared in numerous federal cases to \ndefend its view that entities like Respondents are not \nentitled to constitutional due process. See, e.g., U.S. Br. \n44, Palestine Information Office v. Shultz, 853 F.2d 932 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (No. 87-5398) (\u201cForeign entities such \nas the PLO obviously do not have due process rights \nsince they are not part of our constitutional scheme.\u201d \n(citing South Carolina v.

See Mut. Consent Provisions \nin the Guam Commonwealth Legis., 1994 WL 16193765, \nat *5 (O.L.C. July 28, 1994) (\u201c[T]he rationale of \n[Katzenbach]\u201d is fully applicable to other \u201cgovernmental \nbodies,\u201d even when they are not \u201cstates or instru-\nmentalities of states\u201d); accord Letter from Robert \nRaben, Dep\u2019t of Justice, to Frank H. Murkowski, \nChairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nUnited States Senate 9 n.11 (Jan. 18, 2001) (\u201cWhile \nKatzenbach was concerned with a State, its rationale \nsuggests that a governmental body . . . could not assert \nrights under the Due Process Clause.\u201d).  It would be \nodd to suggest that foreign non-sovereign governing \nbodies, like Respondents, would have greater due process \nrights than domestic bodies with comparable authority.  \nAnd Congress has legislated consistent with these \npronouncements, providing express statutory authority \nfor courts to establish personal jurisdiction over \nRespondents. See Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act \n(\u201cATCA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184 \n(adding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)), and PSJVTA. Pub. L.  \n116-94, div. J, tit.

Mar. 18, 2022) \n\n11 \n(discussing chronology of legislative response to courts\u2019 \nrefusal to exercise jurisdiction over Respondents).  The \ncollective judgment of the political branches over time \nsupports the conclusion that Respondents are not \nentitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause. \nPrecedent/Purpose. This Court\u2019s precedents buttress \nthat conclusion. In Katzenbach, this Court held that \n\u201cthe word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any \nreasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to \nencompass the States of the Union.\u201d 383 U.S. at 323.  \nThe underlying rationale was that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause \u201crecognizes and protects an \nindividual liberty interest,\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694,  \n702 (1982), not a sovereign government\u2019s interest.  \nSubsequently in Weltover, this Court cited Katzenbach \nto suggest that a \u201cforeign state\u201d is likely not a \u201cperson\u201d \nentitled to due process. 504 U.S. at 619.  Following \nWeltover\u2019s lead, the D.C. Circuit and Second Circuit \nhave since affirmatively held that \u201cforeign states\u201d are \nnot persons entitled to due process protection. Price, 294 \nF.3d at 96; Frontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil \nCo. of Azerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 399 (2d Cir. \n2009); \nGater \nAssets \nLtd. \nv. \nAO \nMoldovagaz,  \n2 F.4th 42, 49 (2d Cir. 2021). \nThis development had an unusual effect.  Before \nWeltover, courts in these Circuits did not hesitate to \nconclude that if States of the Union are not \u201cpersons\u201d \nthen neither are foreign political entities like Respond-\nents. See Mendelsohn v. Meese, 695 F. Supp. 1474, 1481 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (\u201c[T]he PLO, an organization whose \nstatus, while uncertain, lies outside the constitutional \nsystem. It has never undertaken to abide by United \nStates law or to accept the constitutional plan. . . . No \n\n12 \nforeign entity of its nature could be expected to do so.\u201d \n(internal quotations omitted)); Palestine Information \nOffice v. Shultz, 674 F. Supp. 910 (D.D.C.1987) (\u201cIf the \nStates of the Union have no due process rights, then \n[the Palestine Information Office as] a \u2018foreign mission\u2019 \nqua \u2018foreign mission\u2019 surely can have none.\u201d).  After \nWeltover and its progeny (e.g., Price, Frontera), some \ncourts drew too fine a line and concluded that any \nforeign entity apart from a sovereign government \nenjoyed due process rights. See Pet. App. 153a-154a; \nLivnat v. Palestinian Authority, 851 F.3d 45, 48-53 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).   \nThis jurisprudential shift was a mistake.  Underlying \nthis shift is a distorted notion of sovereignty and its \nsignificance in the due process inquiry.  Specifically,  \nthe Second and D.C. Circuits appear to believe that if \na foreign political entity is not recognized as sovereign, \nthen it must be a \u201cperson\u201d possessing due process \nrights.  See Pet. App. 153a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 49. \nThis false dichotomy lacks any jurisprudential or \nconceptual rationale.  For instance, political subdivisions, \nmunicipalities, and U.S. territories are not sovereigns, \nyet also cannot claim due process rights.  See, e.g., City \nof E. St. Louis v. Cir. Ct. for the Twentieth Jud. Cir., St. \nClair Cnty., Ill., 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993) \n(\u201cMunicipalities . . . are not \u2018persons\u2019 within the \nmeaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d); City of Sault Ste. \nMarie, Mich. v. Andrus, 532 F. Supp. 157, 167-68 \n(D.D.C. 1980) (concluding municipality could not \nassert due process rights under the Fifth Amendment \nbecause \u201ca state cannot confer a constitutional status \n. . . which the state does not itself enjoy\u201d); Puerto Rico \nPub.

App. 142a, possessing only those limited powers \nafforded it under the Oslo Accords. See Oslo I art III, \n32 I.L.M. at 1529-30 (\u201cIsrael shall transfer authority  \n. . . from the Israeli military government and its Civil \nAdministration to the [PA] . . . on the following \nspheres: education and culture, health, social welfare, \ndirect taxation, and tourism.\u201d); Gaza-Jericho Agreement \nart III, 33 I.L.M. at 627; Oslo II art I, 36 I.L.M. at 559.  \nAnd the PLO is recognized, domestically and inter-\nnationally, as the sole non-sovereign representative  \nof the Palestinian people. Oslo I, 32 I.L.M. at 1527; \nOslo II, 36 I.L.M. at 558 (identifying PLO as \u201cthe \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people\u201d); Pet. App. 6a, \n61a (acknowledging PLO holds Permanent Observer \nstatus to the United Nations on behalf of the \nPalestinian people).  It would be illogical to conclude \nthat foreign non-sovereign governments are somehow \ndifferently situated with respect to personhood under \nour \nConstitution \nthan \ndomestic \nnon-sovereign \ngovernments.  See Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran, \n999 F. Supp. 1, 20-21 (D.D.C. 1998). \nMoreover, the dichotomy does not comport with the \nreasoning of the very courts making it.  As those courts \nhave observed, it would be \u201chighly incongruous to \nafford greater Fifth Amendment rights to foreign \nnations, who are entirely alien to our constitutional \nsystem, than are afforded to the states, who help make \nup the very fabric of that system.\u201d Price, 294 F.3d at \n96-97; Frontera, 582 F.3d at 399.  It would be even more \n\n14 \n\u201cincongruous\u201d to place entities like Respondents\u2014who \nthe Executive Branch and Congress agree are not \nentitled to constitutional protections of any kind\u2014\u201cin \na more favored position with respect to the safeguards \nof due process than both U.S. states and foreign \nsovereigns with whom the political branches have \nestablished friendly relations.\u201d Shatsky, 2022 WL \n826409 at *6; 11 Op. O.L.C. at 120 n.7 (\u201cIt would be \nanomalous if the Executive\u2019s decision to withhold \nrecognition from a foreign political entity \u2013 with respect \nto which it has complete discretion \u2013 invested that \nentity with rights greater than those enjoyed by \nfriendly sovereigns present in the United States.\u201d).  \nSuch an outcome \u201cwould distort the very notion of \n\u2018liberty\u2019 that underlies the Due Process Clause.\u201d  See \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 99.   \nFurthermore, \u201cinterpreting due process rights to \nhinge on diplomatic recognition [and sovereign \nimmunity] (or rather a lack thereof)\u201d would create an \nunreliable rule.  See House of Representatives Br. at \n14, Fuld v. Palestine liberation Organization, (No. 24-\n20) (U.S. Aug. 8, 2024).

As the dissent from \n\n15 \nrehearing en banc observed, \u201c[f]undamental constitutional \nrights are not typically so contingent.\u201d Pet. App. 238a. \nThe counterargument by the D.C. Circuit was that \nnon-sovereign governments cannot be analogized to \nsovereigns for purposes of the Due Process analysis \nbecause they are not the \u201cjuridical equals\u201d of the \nUnited States government and do not possess the \nsame quantum of governmental rights and privileges \notherwise held by recognized states in the domestic \nand international spheres.  Livnat, 851 F.3d at 51 \n(concluding that as a non-sovereign, the PA lacks the \nability to claim sovereign immunity or the \u201cpower to \nsecure its territory against external threats,\u201d Oslo II \nart.

This \nline of reasoning quickly unravels.   \nAn argument rooted in the \u201cquantum of rights\u201d \nRespondents possess on the international stage says \nnothing about whether they are \u201cpersons\u201d within the \nmeaning of the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nIndeed, similar distinctions could be drawn between \nexclusively sovereign governments whom this Court \nhas recognized are not persons within the meaning of \nthat Clause.  The federal government, for example, has \ncertain rights that are greater relative to the States of \nthe Union, which have greater rights relative to \nforeign nations.  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2; see also \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. \n447, 485 (1923) (delineating when States of the Union \nversus the United States has standing to represent \nAmerican citizens as parens patriae); Price, 294 F.3d at \n96 (concluding foreign states have an even weaker \nclaim to personhood status than States of the Union).  \n\n16 \nFinally, even if foreign political entities might \npossess fewer rights and special privileges than \nrecognized sovereigns, see Livnat 851 F.3d at 51, they \nare not powerless to defend their interests. Respondents \nare perfect examples. The PA has a president and \nministers and is the self-proclaimed \u201cgovernment of a \nState[.]\u201d See PA Mtn. to Dismiss Br. at 17, Livnat v. \nPalestinian Authority, (No. 13-498) (E.D. Va.

The PLO conducts foreign affairs \nand maintains dozens of \u2018embassies, missions, and \ndelegations around the world,\u2019 including a UN mission \noffice located in New York City.\u201d See Pet. App. 142a.  In \nshort, Respondents \u201care sophisticated international \norganizations with billion-dollar budgets . . . that \ngovern a territory recognized as a sovereign state by \nmany other countries.\u201d Id. 238a; Jim Zanotti, Cong. \nResearch Serv., U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians 1 \n(Dec. 12, 2018), available at https://sgp.fas.org/crs/ \nmideast/RS22967.pdf (\u201cBilateral assistance to the \nPalestinians since 1994 has totaled more than $5 \nbillion, and has been a key part of U.S. policy to . . . \nstrengthen the West Bank-based PA vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas \nin Gaza.\u201d). One can hardly argue that these entities \nwould be rendered defenseless without the protections \nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nPut simply, while the Executive Branch has not \nrecognized Palestine as a nation-state, Respondents \nremain, as the United States acknowledges here, \u201cnon-\nsovereign foreign entities exercising governmental \nfunctions.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. at 34.

Even if it did so, it \nshould still reverse and remand. \nThis Court could easily dispose of these petitions  \nby holding that Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d within \nthe meaning of the Due Process Clause, a conclusion \nthat is logically antecedent to any of the downstream \narguments about how that Clause might otherwise \napply.  The Court thus need not and should not go \nfurther.  Specifically, it need not definitively decide the \nrelationship between the Fifth Amendment and the \nFourteenth Amendment limits on the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction or demarcate the outer boundaries of \nthe \u201cconsent\u201d doctrine. But if the Court is inclined to \naddress these issues, it should adopt the nationwide \ncontacts test universally employed by the federal \nappellate courts in Fifth Amendment analysis and \nreject a boundless construction of the consent doctrine \nsuggested by the lower court judges dissenting from \nthe denial of en banc rehearing.  If it chooses to explore \nthese issues, it should still reverse and remand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n18 \nA. The Fifth Amendment imposes different \nlimits on the exercise of personal \njurisdiction than does the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nThe Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments impose \nlimits on the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The \nprovisions have \u201cmaterially identical\u201d language.  \nHerederos de Roberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. Teck \nResources Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303,1308 (11th Cir. 2022) \n(Newsom, J.); see also Douglass v. Nippon Yusen \nKabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 243 (5th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc) (Ho, J., concurring) (\u201cThere\u2019s no denying the \ntextual parallel between the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment.\u201d).  And this Court has long recognized \nthat the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nrequires minimum contacts with the sovereign State \nexercising personal jurisdiction.  If the Court decides \nto reach the question, it should hold that the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does too.  The only \nmaterial difference is that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nanalysis focuses on minimum contacts with the United \nStates as the relevant sovereign.  Virtually every \nfederal appellate court has adopted this approach.    \nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court in \nWeltover supplies the starting point for any analysis.  \n504 U.S. 607. Weltover represents one of the first cases \nto reach this Court in the post-International Shoe era \nwhere the exercise of personal jurisdiction involved a \ncase arising under federal law.  Weltover assumed, \nwithout deciding, that the foreign state (Argentina) \nwas entitled to due process.  Id. at 619.  After making \nthat assumption, Weltover went on to explain that \nArgentina possessed \u201cminimum contacts\u201d that would \nsatisfy the relevant constitutional standard. By \nissuing negotiable debt instruments denominated in \n\n19 \nUnited States dollars and payable in New York and by \nappointing a financial agent in that city, Argentina \n\u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the [United States].\u201d  Id. \nat 619-20 (emphasis added).  Weltover\u2019s bracketed \nreference to the \u201cUnited States\u201d necessarily implied \ntwo propositions \u2013 (1) that the minimum contacts \nframework governs the constitutional inquiry under \nthe Fifth Amendment and (2) that the relevant \u201cforum\u201d \nfor contacts analysis purposes is the United States (as \nopposed to a State of the Union). \nSince Weltover, this Court in several subsequent \ndecisions has characterized the contours of the Fifth \nAmendment test as an \u201copen\u201d question.  Virtually all \nof those cases arose out of state court or involved \nfederal courts borrowing state long-arm statutes and, \nthus unlike Weltover, did not confront the Fifth \nAmendment question.  See Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Calif., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); \nNicastro, 564 U.S. at 885 (plurality opinion) Omni \nCapital Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, \n102 n.5, (1987); Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior  \nCt. of Cal., 480 U.S. 102, 113 n.* (1987).  None \nquestioned Weltover\u2019s analytic framework under the \nFifth Amendment.  Moreover, the \u201copen\u201d question \nabout that framework identified in several of those \nopinions was whether the Fifth Amendment requires \nminimum \u201cnationwide\u201d contacts, not whether the Fifth \nAmendment requires any \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to the \nUnited States at all.  See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U.S. at 113 \nn.*; see also Douglass, 46 F. 4th at 240 n.26. \nTo the extent Weltover did not supply a definitive \nholding on the matter, other opinions of this Court \ntrack its essential framework.  This Court\u2019s plurality \nopinion in Nicastro offers the fullest explication.   \n\n20 \n564 U.S. 873.  The Nicastro plurality identified two \ninterrelated principles from a survey of its personal \njurisdiction jurisprudence.  The first principle is that \n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or \nsovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d  Id. at 884.  See also \nFuld Petrs. Br. at 42-43.  The second principle is that \n\u201c[b]ecause the United States is a distinct sovereign, a \ndefendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the courts of the United States but not of any \nparticular State.\u201d  Id. \nBoth before and after Nicastro, decisions of the \nfederal appellate courts have consistently tracked \nthese twin principles.  Specifically, consistent with \nNicastro\u2019s sovereign-specific analysis, virtually every \nfederal appellate court has held that, as a constitu-\ntional matter, a defendant must have sufficient \ncontacts with the United States a whole.  See Gary B. \nBorn & Peter B. Rutledge, International Civil Litigation in \nUnited States Courts 224-29 (7th ed. 2023) (collecting \ncases).2  This is \u201cthe law as it has been unanimously \n \n2 With one possible exception, every federal appellate court has \na reported opinion applying the nationwide contacts test to the \nFifth Amendment inquiry.  See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n592 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (reaffirming nationwide contacts test and \nciting decisions from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Federal Circuits); Douglass, \n46 F.4th at 239 & n. 24 (adopting nationwide contacts test and \nciting cases from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh, Federal \nand D.C. Circuits).  Jurisprudence in the Eighth Circuit is scant, \nbut its most authoritative opinion, In re Federal Fountain, 165 \nF.3d 600 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc), has been interpreted to apply \na nationwide contacts test.  See, e.g., FTC v. BINT Ops. LLC, 595 \nF.Supp.3d 740, 746-47 (E.D. Ark. 2022). \nThe lone exception might be the Tenth Circuit.  Peay v. \nBellSouth Med. Assistance Plan, 205 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2000), \ncould be read to require \u201cconstitutionally significant inconvenience.\u201d  \nKlein v. Cornelius, 786 F.3d 1310 (10th Cir. 2015).  But see \n\n21 \naccepted among the circuit courts.\u201d  Douglass, 46 F.4th \nat 232 n.8.  This \u201cnationwide contacts\u201d test operates in \ncases arising under federal law either where the \nfederal statute supplying the basis for federal question \njurisdiction authorizes nationwide (or worldwide) \nservice of process or, in cases of certain federal claims \nlacking a service of process provision and involving \nforeign defendants, under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 4(k)(2).  See BNSF Ry. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.S. \n402, 409 (2017); Omni Capital, 484 U.S. at 106\u2013107. \nSee also Gov\u2019t Br. at 33. \nOther aspects of federal practice reflect this \ncommonsense view.  Specifically, Rule 4(k)(2), adopted \nby this Court pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, \nauthorizes personal jurisdiction in certain cases that \n(a) arise under federal law and (b) where no state court \nwould have jurisdiction.  See United States v. Swiss \nAm. Bank, 191 F.3d 30, 38-40 (1st Cir. 1999) \n(describing operation of Rule 4(k)(2)).  In such cases, \nRule 4(k)(2) still requires the exercise of jurisdiction to \nbe \u201cconsistent with the [United States] Constitution.\u201d  \nId. at 38.  This formulation necessarily implies that \nsome exercises of personal jurisdiction by the United \nStates can be inconsistent with the Constitution.   \nWhat the rule implies, the Advisory Committee \nNotes confirm.  Those Advisory Committee Notes have \npreviously guided this Court\u2019s interpretation of the \n \nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Inversiones Mercantiles, S.A. v. Grupo Cementos de \nChihuahua S.A.B. De C.V., 970 F.3d 1269, 1281 n.1 (10th Cir. \n2020) (reserving the question whether there is a \u201cmeaningful \ndistinction\u201d between the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth \nAmendment frameworks).  Despite the difference in phraseology, \nthe Tenth Circuit has not explicitly rejected a nationwide \ncontacts test, nor would the results have clearly differed under \nexpress application of a nationwide contacts test. \n\n22 \nconstitutional boundaries of personal jurisdiction.  See, \ne.g., Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 n.11.  \nHere, they explain that the underlying reason for Rule \n4(k)(2)\u2019s \u201cconsistency\u201d test was to ensure that federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction under 4(k)(2) \ncomported with the Fifth Amendment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4 advisory committee\u2019s note (1993).  Specifically, \naccording to the Advisory Committee Notes, \u201c[t]he \nFifth Amendment requires that any defendant have \naffiliating contacts with the United States sufficient to \njustify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that \nparty.\u201d  Id.  \nDespite this practically uniform view among the \nlower federal courts, a few federal judges have pointed \nto scholarly literature suggesting a radically different \nview of the Fifth Amendment.  See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 \nF.4th 587, 597-98 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (Rao, J., concurring); \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 249-82 (Elrod, J., dissenting); see \ngenerally Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction  \nof the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703 (2020).  \nUnder that view, personal jurisdiction can be exercised \nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment so long as it is \nconsistent with whatever process Congress has \nauthorized.  That conclusion follows, according to the \njudges relying on this literature, from the propositions \nthat \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not directly incorporate \nthe traditional limits on personal jurisdiction; the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s limits on such jurisdiction \nrest primarily on narrow concerns about interstate \nfederalism; and the corollary proposition that federalism \ninterests drop out for the Fifth Amendment.  These \nsupporting propositions are all flawed and would lead \nto a dramatic and disruptive sea change in the law if \nendorsed by this Court. \n\n23 \nFor starters, \u201c[i]t is manifest that it was not left to \nthe legislative power to enact any process which might \nbe devised.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land  \n& Imp. Co., 59 U.S. 272, 276 (1855).  The Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, like the Fourteenth\u2019s, \nis \u201ca restraint on the legislative as well as on the \nexecutive and judicial powers of the government, and \ncannot be so construed as to leave congress free to \nmake any process \u2018due process of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d  \nId.  The Fifth Amendment instead guarantees \u201cthose \nusages and modes of proceeding existing in the \ncommon and statute law of England, before the \nemigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not \nto have been unsuited to their civil and political \ncondition by having been acted on by them after the \nsettlement of this country.\u201d  Id. at 277. \nDuring the Founding era, the territorial reach of a \ncourt\u2019s process (that is, the extent of its personal \njurisdiction) was governed by the unwritten law of \nnations.  See, e.g., Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 611-\n13 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (Story, J., riding circuit); Toland \nv. Sprague, 37 U.S. 300, 328 (1838) (describing Picquet\u2019s \nreasoning as having \u201cgreat force\u201d); see generally Austen \nParrish, Foreign Nations, Constitutional Rights and \nInternational Law, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 88, 99 \n(2019) (\u201cIn the Founding era personal jurisdiction was \nlimited by the territorial limits of international law.\u201d).  \nThe law of nations was \u201cadopted in its full extent by \nthe common law, and [was] held to be a part of the law \nof the land.\u201d  4 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the \nLaws of England 67 (Chicago 1979); see also, e.g., The \nNereide, 13 U.S. 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C.J.) (\u201c[T]he \nlaw of nations . . . is a part of the law of the land.\u201d).  \nAnd because due process requires a valid judgment \nissued by a court with jurisdiction, this Court has \n\u201clong\u201d considered \u201cthe principles traditionally followed \n\n24 \nby American courts in marking out the territorial \nlimits of\u201d judicial process to be among those usages \nand modes of proceedings required for due process of \nlaw.  Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 609 \n(1990) (citing Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 722-23 \n(1877)).  So, while those procedural principles apply \nsomewhat differently to state and federal courts, they \nare constitutionalized by the Due Process Clauses  \nof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The \ntraditional rules governing personal jurisdiction apply \ndirectly by those Amendments\u2019 own force. \nThe Founding- and Reconstruction-era history shows, \nmoreover, that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s limits on \nstate-court personal jurisdiction do not merely derive \nfrom narrow concerns about interstate federalism.  See \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55 (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is not \njust about federalism[.]\u201d) (citations and internal \nquotations omitted)).  Those limits are instead state-\nlevel applications of the broader, \u201cwell-established \nprinciples of public law\u201d under the law of nations \ngoverning the territorial reach of all sovereigns\u2019 \ncourts.  Pennoyer, 95 U.S. at 722; see generally Born & \nRutledge at 106-07.  And those limits are \u201cultimately a \nfunction of the individual liberty interest preserved by \nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Insurance Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 702 n.10; see Douglass, 46 F.4th at 236 \n(\u201c\u2018[F]ederalism\u2019 is a proxy for the abstract burden of a \ndefendant submitting to the coercive power of a forum \nwith little interest in the dispute[.]\u201d).  Cf. Bond v. \nUnited States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011) (\u201c[F]ederalism \nprotects the liberty of the individual.\u201d).  While the \nprotection of that liberty interest may give rise to \nadditional federalism concerns when state courts are \ninvolved, the liberty interest is still implicated in \nfederal courts.  Both the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments protect defendants from the \u201cburden of \n\n25 \nlitigating in a distant or inconvenient forum\u201d in \nviolation of the traditional territorial limits on judicial \nprocess governing all sovereigns.  World\u2013Wide \nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291\u201392 \n(1980); see also Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 \nU.S. 797, 807 (1985). \nTaken to its logical extreme, the contrary academic \nargument admits few, if any, limits.  The traditional \nlimits on personal jurisdiction, for both state and \nfederal courts, would remain vulnerable to judicial \nerosion and total abrogation by Congress.  Such abro-\ngation would harm the American business community, \nespecially the small businesses that comprise a majority \nof that community.  See Stephanie Ferguson Melhorn \net al., Small Business Data Center, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce (May 20, 2024), https://www.uschamber.com/ \nsmall-business/small-business-data-center (reporting \nthat 99.9% of businesses in the U.S. are small busi-\nnesses).  On this point, several opinions in Nicastro \nexplained how capacious views of personal jurisdiction \n(like Justice Brennan\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d test from \nAsahi) carry \u201cundesirable consequences . . . no less \nsignificant for domestic producers. The owner of a \nsmall Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby \ndistributor, for example, who might then distribute \nthem to grocers across the country.\u201d  564 U.S. at 885 \n(plurality opinion); see also id. at 891-92 (Breyer, J., \nconcurring in the judgment, joined by Alito, J.) (discussing \nadverse implications of sweeping personal jurisdiction \nrules for domestic small businesses).  The \u201cundesirable \nconsequences\u201d of the academic argument are far more \nsubstantial than Justice Brennan\u2019s foreseeability test.  \nThat same Florida farmer is not simply subject to \npersonal jurisdiction in \u201cforeseeable\u201d federal forums \nbut, rather, in any federal forum provided that the \ndefendant has been served with process. \n\n26 \nAs the Government acknowledges, \u201cstrong policy \nreasons\u201d counsel against the academic argument.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. at 47-48.  As this Court elsewhere has \nacknowledged, apart from the effect on domestic \ncommerce, expansive assertions of jurisdiction (whether \nprescriptive or judicial) elevate the risk of foreign \nnations engaging in retaliatory assertions of jurisdiction \nover United States citizens and companies.  See Kiobel \nv. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 124 (2013).  \nSuch risks are more than hypothetical and have ample \nhistorical precedents.  See Born & Rutledge at 776-79.  \nBy contrast, a constitutional test examining nationwide \ncontacts reduces the friction between the United States \nand foreign nations, thereby accommodating the \u201cstrong \npolicy reasons\u201d noted in the Government\u2019s brief. \nIn sum, the implications of adopting the broad \nposition in this case are not limited to foreign entities \nbut have profound implications for American citizens \nand American business, especially small businesses, \nwhere the costs and burdens of having to defend in \nunfamiliar federal forums are substantial.  Ultimately, \nthese petitions do not require this Court to examine \nthose implications.  As already explained, the values \nunderpinning the Fifth Amendment are not at stake \nin this case: Respondents are not entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n27 \nB. The consent doctrine is a narrow \nexception to those Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment \nlimits \non \npersonal \njurisdiction. \nIt has long been recognized that a defendant can, \nunder some circumstances, consent to personal juris-\ndiction.  Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703.  This \nflows from the uncontested proposition that the \nconstitutional constraints on personal jurisdiction partly \nprotect a nonresident defendant\u2019s \u201cliberty interest.\u201d  \nId. at 702.  But consent is not a wholly malleable \nconcept.  Neither Congress (nor a state government) \ncan \u201csimply declare anything it wants to be consent,\u201d \nsee Pet. App. 123a, lest it trample upon that very \nliberty interest.   \nConsent in this context is not always easy to define.  \nThe easiest cases are typically when consent is \nexplicit, such as in a pre-dispute agreement (like in a \nforum selection or arbitration clause) or after a dispute \nhas arisen (like in a stipulation).  Carnival Cruise \nLines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991); M/S \nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972); \nNational Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n311, 316 (1964); Petrowski v. Hawkeye-Security Co., \n350 U.S. 495, 496 (1956).  Implied consent is more \ndifficult.  This Court has approved it in only a handful \nof cases as a result of certain litigation-related \nconduct, see Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704, or \nselect activity that is \u201cdeemed\u201d consent by operation of \nlaw, see, e.g., Mallory, 600 U.S. at 134-35; Pennsylvania \nFire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 94-95 (1917).   \nThe Second Circuit judges divided on how the \nconsent doctrine might be applied to the PSJVTA.  The \npanel found that the consent doctrine did not support \n\n28 \njurisdiction because the PSJVTA did not rely on \nlitigation-related conduct or on \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d \nthat a defendant derived from the United States.  Pet. \nApp. 25a-47a.  By contrast, the judges dissenting from \nthe denial of en banc rehearing found that the consent \ndoctrine supported jurisdiction because that doctrine \ndid not require a \u201creciprocal benefit;\u201d it simply \nrequired \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d conduct \u201cwith a \nnexus to the forum.\u201d  Id. 231a. \nThe division is not surprising; Mallory left many \nopen questions about the concept of implied consent.  \nIndeed, to the list of factors the Second Circuit \ndiscussed as potentially relevant to the issue of consent, \none could add others.  For example, how \u201cvoluntary\u201d \ndoes the conduct have to be to constitute consent?  Cf. \nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary \nEducation Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 682 (1999).  \nWhat relevance, if any, does the power authorizing the \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d legislation have to the analysis?   \nCf. Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36 \n(2010) (recognizing that, with the exercise of the foreign \naffairs power, the views of the political branches are \n\u201centitled to significant weight\u201d); see also Bank Markazi \nv. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016); Gov\u2019t Br. at 37.  \nHow does the scope of the consent\u2014general or \nspecific\u2014factor into assessment of voluntariness?  Cf. \nHess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 355-56 (1927); Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 29.  And should the particular characteristics of \ndefendants\u2014here, foreign political entities\u2014be taken \ninto account? \nTo the extent this Court seeks to engage on this \nissue, it would be helpful to reject a boundless reading \nof Mallory and impose clear guardrails.  \u201cA prospective \ndefendant\u2019s activities do not signify consent to personal \njurisdiction simply because Congress has labeled them \n\n29 \nas such.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  Much like a boundless \ninterpretation of the Fifth Amendment, supra Part \nII.A., a boundless \u201cconsent doctrine\u201d would undermine \nthe individual liberty interests of all persons protected \nby the Due Process Clauses, including United States \ncitizens.  A boundless construction of the consent \ndoctrine \u201cwould effectively mean that there are no due \nprocess limitations on the exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion.  Congress or a state legislature could provide for \njurisdiction over any defendant for any conduct so long \nas the conduct postdated enactment of the law at issue.\u201d  \nId. 115a.  For example, Congress could enact a statute \nsubjecting United States citizens to all-purpose general \njurisdiction in any federal court in the country based \nupon their implied \u201cconsent\u201d through engagement in \ncertain ordinary, even constitutionally protected, acts \nlike purchasing goods from another state or interstate \ntravel.  Such an approach would be inconsistent with \nsettled doctrine.  See College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at \n682.   \nAnd a boundless theory of consent is simply unnec-\nessary.  This Court\u2019s general jurisdiction jurisprudence \nalready \u201cafford[s] plaintiffs recourse to at least one \nclear and certain forum\u201d in the case of domestic \ndefendants, Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 137 \n(2014): the defendant\u2019s domicile in case of an individual \ndefendant and, in the case of a corporate entity, its \nstate of incorporation and, possibly, a separate \nprincipal place of business.  Foreign defendants may \nalso be subject to jurisdiction in the United States if \nthey meet an appropriate contacts analysis.  See supra \nPart II.A. Here, of course, Respondents are not even \nentitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause.   \n \n\n30 \nThis final point returns full circle to the Chamber\u2019s \nopening argument:  Respondents are not entitled to \nthe protections of the Due Process Clause.  This Court \nshould reverse on that basis.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the lower court\u2019s judgment \nshould be reversed, and the case should be remanded. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJENNIFER B.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs have been updated by the introduction of a significant amicus brief from former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in support of the petitioners. While this observation did not provide the sought-after respondents' brief, it substantially reinforces and adds a new dimension to the petitioners' case, increasing the perceived strength of their position. My core uncertainty about the respondents' counterarguments remains, but my understanding of the arguments the Supreme Court will consider has expanded.\n\nMy current understanding of the case is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Legal Framing:** My belief in the petitioners' three-pronged legal strategy remains firm. This strategy includes:\n    1.  **An Originalist Distinction:** Arguing the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not impose the same \"minimum contacts\" test as the Fourteenth, especially in foreign affairs.\n    2.  **A Precedent-Based Challenge:** Asserting that *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* is controlling and that its affirmation of \"consent-by-registration\" jurisdiction invalidates the Second Circuit's more restrictive test for consent.\n    3.  **A Fallback \"Fair Warning\" Argument:** Claiming the PSJVTA itself provides sufficient \"fair warning\" to satisfy modern due process standards.\n\n*   **New Supporting Argument (Separation of Powers & Foreign Policy Deference):** The Pompeo amicus brief introduces a powerful new line of argument. It frames the PSJVTA not merely as a jurisdictional statute but as a \"considered policy judgment\" by the political branches (Congress and the Executive) in the realm of foreign policy and national security. The core of this new argument is that the judiciary must grant significant deference to the political branches on counterterrorism policy, an area where courts lack the \"aptitude, facilities, nor responsibility.\" This argument provides the Court a path to uphold the law by deferring to Congress and the Executive, potentially sidestepping a more complex analysis of personal jurisdiction precedents like *Mallory* and *International Shoe*.\n\n*   **New Factual Evidence (Executive-Legislative Collaboration):** The Pompeo brief provides concrete evidence that the PSJVTA was the product of active collaboration between the State Department and Congress. The inclusion of a 2019 letter from then-Secretary Pompeo to Senator Grassley demonstrates that the Executive Branch at the time viewed the law as advancing \"critical U.S. interests.\" This fact undermines any potential characterization of the PSJVTA as a purely legislative overreach and strengthens the argument that it represents a unified foreign policy decision of the U.S. government.\n\n*   **Strengthened Critique of the Lower Court:** The Pompeo brief reinforces the critique of the Second Circuit's decision, but from a different angle. It argues the court \"improperly trammeled\" the powers of the political branches by applying domestic, state-focused (Fourteenth Amendment) jurisdictional concepts to a federal statute concerning foreign entities and national security (Fifth Amendment). It also directly refutes the idea that the PLO/PA's conduct was not \"targeted at the United States,\" arguing that funding terrorism that foreseeably kills Americans is, by its nature, directed at the United States, a judgment Congress and the Executive are empowered to make.\n\n*   **Stable Understanding of Key Precedents:** *Mallory* remains central to the petitioners' case, but the Pompeo brief suggests it is not the only, or perhaps even the primary, path to victory. The Court could rule for the petitioners based on deference to the political branches alone.\n\n*   **Amplified Uncertainty:** My knowledge base is now even more heavily weighted towards the petitioners. The absence of the Brief in Opposition from the PLO and PA is more pronounced. It is now critical to see how the respondents will counter not only the *Mallory* and originalist arguments but also this formidable separation of powers and foreign policy deference argument. Furthermore, the Pompeo brief represents the view of a *former* administration. The position of the *current* U.S. Solicitor General remains a crucial, unknown variable that will be highly influential on the Court. My prediction remains highly tentative until these opposing and official government viewpoints are integrated.",

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs have been updated by a highly significant amicus brief from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in support of the petitioners. This observation introduces a novel and potentially dispositive legal argument, while also adding crucial nuance to arguments I had previously identified. The case for the petitioners now appears substantially stronger, resting on at least three distinct and powerful lines of reasoning. My core uncertainty about the respondents' counterarguments and the current Solicitor General's position remains, but the strategic landscape the Supreme Court will navigate is now much clearer.\n\nMy current understanding of the case is as follows:\n\n*   **New Threshold Argument (Constitutional Standing):** The Chamber of Commerce brief introduces a powerful threshold argument that could decide the case on the narrowest grounds: that the PLO and PA, as foreign political entities, are not \"persons\" entitled to due process protections under the Fifth Amendment.\n    *   **Basis:** This argument is grounded in constitutional text (which distinguishes \"persons\" from \"foreign states\" and other political bodies), a long history of Executive Branch interpretation (citing multiple Office of Legal Counsel opinions stating the PLO has no constitutional rights), and judicial precedent (*Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya*).\n    *   **Strategic Impact:** This provides the Court with an \"off-ramp\" to reverse the Second Circuit without needing to delve into the more complex and potentially disruptive questions surrounding personal jurisdiction precedents like *Mallory* or the scope of Congress's power in foreign affairs. If the Court accepts that the PLO/PA lack the right to even raise a due process challenge, the entire inquiry ends.\n\n*   **Refined Legal Framing (Fifth vs. Fourteenth Amendment):** My prior belief in the petitioners' originalist distinction between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is now refined. The Chamber's brief supports this distinction but advocates for a specific standard: the Fifth Amendment requires that a defendant have \"minimum contacts with the United States as a whole.\" This provides a concrete test for the Court to adopt, reinforcing the idea that the state-centric \"minimum contacts\" test used by the Second Circuit was inappropriate for a federal statute dealing with foreign entities.\n\n*   **Nuanced Understanding of Key Precedents (*Mallory*):** My belief that *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* was a primary path to victory for the petitioners is now tempered. The Chamber, representing the business community, explicitly cautions the Court against an overly broad reading of *Mallory*. It argues that the decision should not be seen as a \"blank check\" for legislatures to deem any activity as consent to general jurisdiction. This signals to the Court that a major stakeholder is concerned about the potential unintended consequences of a sweeping ruling based on *Mallory*'s consent theory. This makes the other available arguments (the \"not a person\" theory or the \"foreign policy deference\" theory) potentially more attractive to the Court.\n\n*   **Stable Supporting Argument (Separation of Powers & Foreign Policy Deference):** The argument from the Pompeo amicus brief\u2014that courts must defer to the \"considered policy judgment\" of the political branches in matters of counterterrorism and foreign policy\u2014remains a stable and potent alternative path for the Court. It complements the Chamber's arguments by providing another reason to uphold the statute that sidesteps a direct confrontation with personal jurisdiction doctrine.\n\n*   **Consolidated View of Petitioners' Strategy:** The petitioners' case now rests on a formidable three-pronged foundation, giving the Supreme Court multiple independent avenues to rule in their favor:\n    1.  **The Threshold Path (Chamber):** The PLO/PA are not \"persons\" under the Fifth Amendment and cannot claim its protections.\n    2.  **The Deference Path (Pompeo):** The PSJVTA is a foreign policy judgment by the political branches that demands judicial deference.\n    3.  **The Jurisdictional Path (Petitioners/Chamber):** The PSJVTA is a valid exercise of congressional power over jurisdiction, either because *Mallory*'s consent framework applies or because the PLO/PA's contacts with the U.S. as a whole satisfy the Fifth Amendment's distinct standard.\n\n*   **Amplified and Focused Uncertainty:** My knowledge base is now overwhelmingly weighted toward the petitioners. The absence of the respondents' Brief in Opposition is more critical than ever. The respondents must now formulate a defense that can withstand three distinct and powerful lines of attack. The position of the current U.S. Solicitor General has become the most crucial unknown variable. Which of these three paths, if any, will the U.S. government endorse? The SG's choice will be a powerful signal to the Court about the most viable and institutionally sound way to resolve the case. My prediction remains highly tentative until these opposing and official government viewpoints are known.",

For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.  Latching onto the broad provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners in case No. 24-20, who were plaintiffs-\nappellants below, are: Mark I.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.  Latching onto the broad provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners in case No. 24-20, who were plaintiffs-\nappellants below, are: Mark I.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents did not accept \u201csome in-forum benefit in \nreturn for an agreement to be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit then denied en banc review.  In \na concurrence to that denial, Judge Bianco (a member \nof the Panel) explained that nothing in the Panel\u2019s \nopinion requires an \u201cexchange of benefits\u201d as the sole \nbasis to infer consent, and that the PSJVTA in any \nevent falls outside the Mallory line of \u201cexchange of \nbenefits\u201d cases.  Id. at 212-15a.  Adopting the new \n\u201cnexus\u201d tests proposed by Petitioners, he explained, \n\u201cwould allow Congress to subject any foreign entity to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, even in the \nabsence of any contacts with the United States, if that \nentity knowingly and voluntary engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute \nconsent.\u201d  Id. at 216a.  This \u201cwould allow the \ngovernment to declare conduct to be consent, even if \n\n8 \n \n \nthat conduct could not reasonably be considered to be \nconsent.\u201d  Id.  \nREASONS TO DENY THE PETITIONS \nI. \nThe decisions below are faithful to Bauxites \nand Mallory.    \nThe Second Circuit scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Bauxites and Mallory.  Applying \nthat precedent, it held that the PSJVTA\u2019s deemed \nconsent provisions fail to create personal jurisdiction \nbecause the activities they specify do not \u201csupport a \nfair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nId. at 26a.  This also followed a unanimous line of \ndecisions holding that Respondents\u2019 actions lack \nsufficient connection to the United States to justify \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction.  Id. at 8-9a; e.g., \nShatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, 1036-37.  The court of \nappeals thus explained that \u201cCongress cannot take \nconduct otherwise insufficient to support an inference \nof consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.  \nThis result flows naturally from established precedent.   \nA. \nConsent to personal jurisdiction must be \nbased \non \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nconduct reflecting legal submission to \njurisdiction. \n \u201cBecause the requirement of personal jurisdiction \nrepresents first of all an individual right, it can, like \nother such rights, be waived.\u201d  Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 \n(1982).  A party may expressly consent to the court\u2019s \njurisdiction, or impliedly consent by \u201csignal[ing]\u201d its \nagreement \u201cthrough actions rather than words.\u201d  Roell \nv. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 589-91 (2003).  Bauxites \ncataloged a \u201cvariety of legal arrangements [that] have \nbeen taken to represent express or implied consent to \n\n9 \n \n \nthe personal jurisdiction of the court,\u201d including \nsubmission \u201cby appearance,\u201d forum-selection clauses, \nstipulation, \u201cconstructive consent\u201d through \u201cthe \nvoluntary use of certain state procedures,\u201d and failure \nto assert a jurisdictional defense.  456 U.S. at 703-04.  \nEach of these \u201clegal arrangements\u201d reflects some \n\u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \u201camount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Id. at 703-\n05.  See Pet. App. 20-21a. \n\u201c[W]hether express or implied,\u201d however, this Court \nhas \u201cemphasiz[ed]\u201d that a party\u2019s consent to \njurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d  \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, \n685 (2015).  An \u201ceffective waiver of a constitutional \nright\u201d generally requires proof of \u201cthe \u2018intentional \nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or \nprivilege.\u2019\u201d  College Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 682 \n(1999).  Because implied or \u201cconstructive\u201d consent \u201cis \nnot a doctrine commonly associated with the \nsurrender of constitutional rights,\u201d federal courts \n\u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 681-82. \nIn \nsome \ncases, \nthe \ncourt \nbelow \nexplained, \ndetermining whether a defendant knowingly and \nvoluntarily consented to personal jurisdiction is \nstraightforward.  Pet. App. 19-20a.  A party may \nexpressly agree to litigate in a particular forum.  Id.  \nCourts may also infer consent to jurisdiction based on \nactions in the litigation itself that demonstrate \nsubmission to jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Roell, 538 U.S. at \n584 (parties who \u201cvoluntarily participated in the \nentire course of proceedings\u201d without objecting to \njurisdiction \u201cclearly implied their consent\u201d \u201cby their \nactions\u201d).  These canonical forms of consent are not at \nissue, however, because Petitioners do not claim that \nRespondents expressly consented, or took any \n\n10 \n \n \nlitigation action evincing submission to jurisdiction.  \nSee Pet. App. 25a. \nAbsent express consent or litigation conduct \nevincing submission to jurisdiction, determining \nwhether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to personal jurisdiction is more difficult.  To \nestablish \nimplied \nconsent, \nPlaintiffs \nmust \ndemonstrate some \u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \n\u201camount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-05.  This is \u201ca deeply \nfactbound analysis\u201d that requires the court to \ndetermine \u201cwhether [defendant\u2019s] actions evinced the \nrequisite knowing and voluntary consent.\u201d  Wellness \nInt\u2019l, 575 U.S. at 685-86.  See Pet. App. 32a.   \nIn \nmaking \nthis \ndetermination, \nthis \nCourt \ndistinguishes \nbetween \ninferring \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nchoice \nto \nsubmit \nto \njurisdiction by its own conduct, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 \nof power\u201d by the forum to impose jurisdiction on \nnonconsenting defendants.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 705.  \nBauxites examined whether the defendant\u2019s failure to \ncomply with court-ordered jurisdictional discovery \ncould be treated as constructive waiver of its objection \nto personal jurisdiction.  Bauxites held that it could, \nbut only because the \u201cpreservation of due process was \nsecured by the presumption\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \nspecific conduct\u2014its \u201cfailure to supply the requested \ninformation as to its contacts with [the forum]\u201d\u2014\u201cwas \nbut an admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d  Id. at 705, 709 (quoting Hammond Packing \nCo. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909)).  By \nrefusing to produce the requested materials, the \ndefendant implicitly acknowledged that it did have \nsufficient contacts with the forum to support personal \njurisdiction.  Id. at 706.  The defendant\u2019s conduct thus \nserved as a constructive waiver of any objection to \njurisdiction.  See id. (\u201c[T]he sanction is nothing more \n\n11 \n \n \nthan the invocation of a legal presumption, or what is \nthe same thing, the finding of a constructive waiver.\u201d); \nPet. App. 32a. \nTo illustrate the \u201cdue process limits\u201d that apply to \nconstructive consent, Bauxites distinguished Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), \u201cin which the Court held \nthat it did violate due process for a court to take \nsimilar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey [a \ncourt] order\u201d unrelated to the asserted defense.  \nBauxites, 456 U.S. at 705-06 (emphasis added).  The \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in that case\u2014failure \u201cto pay into \nthe registry of the court a certain sum of money\u201d\u2014did \nnot support the presumption of a \u201cwant of merit\u201d in its \nasserted defense.  Id.  Subjecting the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction, the Court explained, therefore \nconstituted an improper penalty, rather than a valid \npresumption of constructive waiver drawn from the \ndefendant\u2019s own conduct.  See id. at 706 (\u201cDue process \nis violated only if the behavior of the defendant will \nnot support the Hammond Packing presumption.\u201d).  \nAs the court below explained, this Court also \ndistinguished between valid, implied consent to \njurisdiction \nand \nthe \nimproper \nimposition \nof \njurisdiction in College Savings Bank.  Pet. App. 39-40a.  \nIn that case, plaintiffs argued a state agency waived \nits immunity and \u201cimpliedly\u201d consented to jurisdiction \nby knowingly and voluntarily engaging in interstate \nmarketing after a federal statute stated that such \nactivity would subject it to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at \n671, 676.  Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia \nrejected this \u201cconstructive-waiver\u201d theory based on \nthe difference between a party\u2019s waiver of immunity \nand \n\u201cCongress\u2019s \nexpressing \nunequivocally \nits \nintention that if the State takes certain action it shall \nbe deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d  Id. at 680-\n81.  He emphasized that a voluntary decision to waive \nimmunity was different from being \u201cput on notice that \n\n12 \n \n \nCongress intends to subject\u201d the state to personal \njurisdiction.  Id.  The constitutional requirement of \nconsent would mean nothing if Congress had \u201c[the] \npower to exact constructive waivers\u201d of jurisdictional \ndefenses \u201cthrough the exercise of Article I powers.\u201d  Id. \nat 683.  Merely providing notice of Congress\u2019s intent \nto subject the defendant to jurisdiction if it \n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaged in \u201cfederally regulated conduct\u201d \nwas insufficient to establish a constructive waiver.  Id. \nat 679-82.  See Pet. App. 40-41a.     \nIn describing the circumstances in which plaintiffs \ncould demonstrate implied consent to jurisdiction, \nCollege Savings Bank located valid \u201cconsent\u201d in the \nchoice to accept a government benefit or privilege \nconditioned upon consent.  Congress may \u201ccondition \nits grant of [federal] funds to the States\u201d upon their \nwillingness to consent to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at 686-\n87.  The \u201cacceptance of the funds\u201d by the State would \nsignal its \u201cagreement\u201d to the condition attached.  Id.  \nAccepting this type of \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d conditioned \non consent to jurisdiction, however, presents a \n\u201cfundamentally different\u201d case than the imposition of \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Id.  In the latter case, \n\u201cwhat Congress threatens if the State refuses to agree \nto its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, \nbut a sanction.\u201d  Id.4   \nThis Court has used that same barometer to \nevaluate other implied consent statutes.  Many states, \nfor example, condition the \u201cprivilege\u201d of driving on \npublic roads on consent to personal jurisdiction for \nrelated lawsuits.  Because the state has the \nantecedent authority \u201cto regulate the use of its \n \n4  Although College Savings Bank addressed state sovereign \nimmunity, its analysis was based on broader constitutional \nprinciples as it relied on the \u201cclassic description of an effective \nwaiver of a constitutional right.\u201d  527 U.S. at 681-82. \n\n13 \n \n \nhighways\u201d and to \u201cexclude\u201d non-residents from such \nuse, states may also require non-residents to consent \nto jurisdiction \u201cin advance of the operation of a motor \nvehicle on its highway.\u201d  Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. \n352, 354-57 (1927).  By \u201caccept[ing]\u201d the \u201cprivilege[]\u201d \nof driving on public roads, a non-resident defendant \nimplicitly \u201csignifi[es] \u2026 his agreement,\u201d through his \nconduct, to consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nforum.  Id. \nAs the court of appeals explained, Mallory similarly \nheld that consent may be inferred from a defendant\u2019s \nacceptance of a benefit \u201cwith jurisdictional strings \nattached.\u201d  600 U.S. at 145; Pet. App. 32-33a.  Mallory \nreaffirmed that Bauxites provides the governing \nstandard for implied consent statutes, and requires a \ncourt to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s \u201cactions \u2026 \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of \n[the] court.\u2019\u201d  600 U.S. at 145-46 (plurality op.); id. at \n147-49 (Jackson, J., concurring); id. at 153, 156 (Alito, \nJ., concurring in part); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting) \n(each \nciting \nBauxites). \n \nBusiness \nregistration statutes\u2014under which a corporation \n\u201cconsents\u201d to personal jurisdiction \u201cin exchange \u2018for \naccess to [a State\u2019s] markets\u2019\u201d\u2014are one of the \u201cvariety \nof legal arrangements\u201d that can give rise to valid \nconsent under Bauxites.  Id. at 141 n.8 (emphasis \nadded).  See Pet. App. 32-35a. \nMallory\u2019s discussion of the grounds for inferring \nvalid consent to jurisdiction \u201cunderscores\u201d the \ndifference \u201cbetween the PSJVTA and business \nregistration statutes.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  Unlike a \nbusiness registration statute, the PSJVTA \u201cdoes not \nrequire that the PLO and the PA consent to \njurisdiction as a condition of securing a legal right to \ndo business in the United States, which remains \nprohibited under current law.\u201d  Id.  It also does not \noffer \u201csome in-forum benefit\u201d for Respondents to \n\n14 \n \n \naccept \u201cin return for an agreement to be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Id.  The PSJVTA thus falls \noutside the exchange of benefits cases reaffirmed by \nMallory, which hinge on \u201caccepting an in-[forum] \nbenefit with jurisdictional strings attached.\u201d  600 U.S. \nat 145.  The PSJVTA, on the other hand, relies on \nconduct that courts have repeatedly held cannot \nconstitutionally support personal jurisdiction.  Pet. \nApp. 8-9a.  \nAs College Savings Bank recognized, if the activity \npurportedly giving rise to \u201cconsent\u201d does not require \nauthorization from the forum, the defendant\u2019s choice \nto engage in the activity does not reflect any implied \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction because the \nactivity does not depend on any benefit (or \u201cgratuity\u201d) \nconferred by the forum.  527 U.S. at 680-81.  In such \na case, \u201cthere is little reason to assume actual consent \nbased upon the [defendant\u2019s] mere presence in a field \nsubject to congressional regulation.\u201d  Id.  See Pet. App. \n109a. \nThis does not mean, as the court of appeals was \ncareful to explain, that reciprocity or an exchange of \nbenefits is necessary for knowing and voluntary \nconsent.  Pet. App. 35a n.13, 212-13a.  Consent may \nalso be express, for example, or implied through the \nfailure to comply with procedural rules.  See Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 703-05.  But Petitioners never identified a \nsingle case implying consent to jurisdiction based on a \ndefendant\u2019s choice to engage in non-litigation-related \nactivities in the absence of some benefit or privilege \nconferred upon the defendant in exchange for its \nconsent.  Pet. App. 43a.  As the court below concluded, \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s \u201capproach to deemed consent is \u2018simply \nunheard of.\u201d  Id.   \n \n \n\n15 \n \n \nB. \nRespondents did not knowingly and \nvoluntarily submit to jurisdiction. \nThe court of appeals measured the PSJVTA against \nthose longstanding standards, and unsurprisingly \nheld the statute fails to provide knowing and \nvoluntary consent to personal jurisdiction in this case.  \nRather than identifying conduct that might actually \ndemonstrate implied consent (such as the acceptance \nof U.S. foreign aid or another government benefit), \nCongress \u201csimply declared\u201d that conduct the Second \nand \nD.C. \nCircuits \nhad \nalready \nheld \nwas \nconstitutionally insufficient to support personal \njurisdiction \u201cconstitute[s] \u2018consent\u2019 to jurisdiction.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a.  \u201cNo aspect of these allegedly \njurisdiction-triggering activities can reasonably be \ninterpreted as evincing the defendants\u2019 \u2018intention to \nsubmit\u2019 to the United States courts.\u201d  Id.  Those \nholdings do not warrant this Court\u2019s attention. \n1. Payments made in Palestine do not reflect \nsubmission to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. \nThe \nreasoning \nof \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nis \nstraightforward.  The first type of conduct specified by \nthe PSJVTA\u2014payments made in Palestine to families \nof every person imprisoned or killed in the conflict\u2014\nhas no connection to the United States.  Id. at 26-27a.  \nThe payments at issue occur entirely outside the \nUnited States under a uniform Palestinian law, and \ndo \nnot \nrequire \nauthorization \nfrom \nthe \nU.S. \ngovernment or the involvement of any U.S. entity.  \nThe payments reflect Respondents\u2019 own domestic laws \nand policies, rather than some implicit agreement to \nknowingly and voluntarily submit to jurisdiction in \nthe United States.  Accordingly, under the framework \nset forth in Bauxites, the payments \u201cdo not infer any \nintention on the part of Defendants to legally submit \n\n16 \n \n \nto suit in the United States\u201d\u2014as the lower courts \ncorrectly recognized.  Id. at 74a, 27a. \nPetitioners conflate federal authority to penalize \nextraterritorial conduct (so-called \u201cprescriptive\u201d or \n\u201clegislative\u201d jurisdiction) and federal authority to \nsubject \nnonresident \ndefendants \nto \npersonal \njurisdiction in U.S. courts (so-called \u201cadjudicative\u201d \njurisdiction).  Although Congress may legislate that \nsuch payments can subject a party to liability (or some \nother sanction), that prescriptive authority does not \nanswer the separate constitutional question whether \nRespondents can be forced to adjudicate such claims \nin U.S. courts.  As noted above, courts have already \nheld that the payments fail to establish the \nconstitutionally \nrequisite \n\u201cconnection\u201d \nbetween \nRespondents, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the United States \nto support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.   \nPetitioners suggest that the payments bear a close \n\u201cconnection\u201d to the ATA claims at issue because they \nare made by reason of attacks that injured or killed \nU.S. nationals.  See Gov\u2019t Pet. 17.  That assertion \noverlooks the courts\u2019 consistent holdings that the \nattacks at issue (and thus payments following from \nsuch attacks) did not target the United States, and \n\u201caffected United States citizens only because they \nwere victims of indiscriminate violence that occurred \nabroad.\u201d  Pet. App. 168a.  Because the attacks were \nnot jurisdictionally connected to the United States, \npost-attack payments a fortiori lack a jurisdictional \nnexus. \nThe payments are part of a broader program \ndesigned to provide a \u201csocial safety net in the face of \nbrutal and oppressive living conditions under Israeli \n\n17 \n \n \nmilitary occupation.\u201d5  The PA thus provides welfare \npayments to all families of Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled for political crimes and security offenses\u2014broad \nlegislation that recognizes that 70% of Palestinian \nfamilies have at least one relative detained by Israel.6  \nTens of thousands of prisoners and families receive \nthe monthly payments.\n7   Given this context, \nportraying these payments as intended to incentivize \nterrorism is \u201cwrong and incendiary.\u201d8   \n2. Petitioners failed to argue U.S. activities \nthat could create jurisdiction, and then \nwaived the argument on appeal. \nThe court of appeals did not decide whether the \nPSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities predicate was met, or if facts \nmight someday exist that could justify jurisdiction.  \nThough Respondents created a significant factual \nrecord on that predicate before the trial courts, \nPetitioners made only fleeting references to that \nrecord on appeal.  Petitioners\u2019 claim that the issue was \n\u201cuncontested\u201d \nbelow \nis \nseriously \nwrong \nand \nmisleading.  Pl.

Doc. \n1064 at 12-14 (summarizing evidence).  In the end, the \ncourts did not decide if the U.S. activities prong was \ntriggered.  Pet. App. 15a n.4, 67-68a.  But they did \nhold that even the U.S. activities as alleged were \u201ctoo \nthin to support a meaningful inference of consent to \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 108a, 74a. \nb.  Before the court of appeals, Petitioners\u2019 opening \nbriefs did not meaningfully delve into the facts \nregarding the U.S. activities.  To the contrary, \n \n9 Plaintiffs argued Respondents\u2019 UN mission would trigger the \nPSJVTA if its social media posts constituted \u201cpropaganda.\u201d  That \nposition would render the statute unconstitutionally vague. \n\n19 \n \n \nPlaintiffs expressly requested that the court of \nappeals not decide the U.S. activities issue.  See \nSokolow C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 542 at 35 n.3 (asking \ncourt of appeals not to decide second factual predicate); \nFuld C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 161 at 26 n.7 (same).  The \nGovernment, for its part, did not dispute that the UN \nmission was Respondents\u2019 only office in the United \nStates.  Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 73 at 7.  It also took \n\u201cno position on whether any of the statute\u2019s factual \npredicates have been satisfied.\u201d  Fuld D.Ct. Doc. 53 at \n8 n.5.  Respondents, on appeal, affirmed they had no \n\u201cphysical presence\u201d in the U.S. other than their UN \nmission and did not engage in any \u201cnon-UN-related \nactivities in the United States.\u201d  Fuld C.A. Def. Br. \nDoc. 148 at 23 n.2, 46-47, 48 n.19.  Respondents noted \ntheir arguments about the UN mission\u2019s activities in \nthe trial court.  Id. at 48 n.20.   \nGiven that Petitioners asked it not to decide the U.S. \nactivities \nquestion, \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nunsurprisingly found it \u201cunnecessary to address that \nquestion on this appeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (Fuld); id. at \n68a (Sokolow).  The court of appeals instead explained \nthat Respondents are \u201cprohibited\u201d from operating in \nthe United States.  Id. at 28-29a.  And that \u201cUN-\nrelated conduct and offices \u2026 are protected pursuant \nto international treaty\u201d and, \u201cas set forth in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3), are exempt from the PSJVTA\u2019s second \nprong.\u201d  Id.  Nor could the PSJVTA be read as \nconferring a benefit, in any case, \u201cbecause the \ndefendants have not been granted permission to \nengage in th[e] [prohibited] activities at all.\u201d  Id.  The \ncourt of appeals made clear that any such permission \nwould have to be granted \u201cformal[ly]\u201d (id. at n.9), \nbelying the Government\u2019s argument that the \u201ccourt \ndid not offer a defense of its premise that the \ngovernment must affirmatively permit the relevant \nactivity through the PSJVTA itself or another statute.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \n \nGov\u2019t Pet. 21.  For those reasons, the \u201csecond prong of \nthe PSJVTA similarly specifies predicate conduct that \ndoes not evince the defendants\u2019 agreement to subject \nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the United States \ncourts.\u201d  Pet. App. 27a.  \n This \nCourt \nshould \nnot \nconsider \nwhether \nRespondents triggered the U.S. activities prong as a \nmatter of first impression.  See CRST Van Expedited, \nInc. v. EEOC, 578 U.S. 419, 435 (2016) (\u201cIt is not the \nCourt\u2019s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or \npredicate factual questions in the first instance.\u201d).  \n3. Unlike the ATCA, the PSJVTA does not \nrely on benefits conditioned on consent. \nThe PSJVTA\u2019s failure to establish valid, implied \nconsent to jurisdiction is well-illustrated by the \ncontrast with its predecessor statute, the ATCA.  The \nATCA provided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they \naccepted either of two government benefits: (1) U.S. \nforeign aid, or (2) the \u201cbenefit[]\u201d of a formal \u201cwaiver or \nsuspension\u201d of the prohibitions on their activities \nunder the 1987 ATA.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018). \nRegarding the ATCA, the Government argued that \nbecause \u201cthe political branches have long imposed \nconditions on these benefits,\u201d it was \u201creasonable and \nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment\u201d for Congress \n\u201cto determine that the [PLO\u2019s] maintenance of an \noffice in this country after a waiver \u2026, or the [PA\u2019s] \ncontinued receipt of certain foreign assistance, should \nbe \u2018deemed\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d  U.S. \nBrief 12-13, Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 13, 2019) (emphasis added).  The \nATCA satisfied due process, in other words, because it \ngrounded \u201cdeemed consent\u201d on Respondents\u2019 choice to \naccept or reject benefits conditioned upon consent.  \nBoth the Second and D.C. Circuits held that the ATCA \n\n21 \n \n \ndid \nnot \ncreate \npersonal \njurisdiction \nbecause \nRespondents elected not to accept either benefit.  Pet. \nApp. 10-11a; Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1128-31.   \nThe PSJVTA, by contrast, does not confer any \nbenefit on Respondents in exchange for their \npurported \u201cconsent.\u201d  It does not authorize them to \nengage in activities in the United States prohibited by \nthe 1987 ATA and similar statutes, and does not \nextend any government benefit (e.g., foreign aid) \nconditioned upon consent to personal jurisdiction.10  \nNor have Respondents received any benefit because \nthe PSJVTA does not alter preexisting prohibitions on \ntheir U.S. activities.  The court of appeals expressly \nleft undecided whether the PSJVTA could be \nconstitutional \u201cunder different circumstances\u201d (for \nexample, if Respondents began non-UN operations in \nthe United States).  Pet. App. 38a; id. at 27-29a.  But \nthat is a benefit not presently offered by the United \nStates to Respondents.  \nII.   The petitions fail to raise any circuit split or \nissue of exceptional importance.  \nThe petitions in this case are exceptional only in \nthat no court has ever agreed with the positions they \nespouse.  The lower courts are unanimous in holding \nthe PSJVTA is unconstitutional in these cases.  They \nare equally unanimous in rejecting Petitioners\u2019 \narguments that the Fifth Amendment presents \nfundamentally different protections to individual \nliberty than the Fourteenth.  Nor do these petitions \n \n10 Various statutes prohibit Respondents from operating in the \nU.S., including the 1987 ATA, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 (barring the PLO \nand, now, its successor-in-part, the PA, from maintaining an \noffice or expending funds in the U.S.), and the 2006 ATA, \u00a7 7(a), \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378b note (making it \u201cunlawful\u201d to operate \u201cat the \nbehest or direction of, or with funds provided by, the Palestinian \nAuthority\u201d).  See Pet. App. 28a n.9. \n\n22 \n \n \npresent matters hampering U.S. antiterrorism efforts.  \nNor is the PSJVTA of broad applicability\u2014it only \napplies to two sui generis entities for which the federal \ncourts repeatedly rejected jurisdiction.   \nA. \nThe petitions raise no split in authority \nor disagreement between the circuits. \n1.  Every court to reach the issue agrees the \nPSJVTA does not create consent to jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs in three New York cases used the PSJVTA \nto claim personal jurisdiction.  The trial courts \nunanimously found that satisfaction of the statute\u2019s \nfactual predicates did not demonstrate consent to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 94a, 80a, 71a; Shatsky, \n2022 WL 826409, *4-5.  A Colorado district court \nagreed, finding \u201cthat Congress cannot simply legislate \nthat \u2018any conduct, without regard for its connections \nto the United States generally \u2026 signals a party\u2019s \nintent to submit to the jurisdiction of a United States \ncourt.\u2019\u201d  Levine, 688 F. Supp. 3d at 1010.  The Second \nCircuit agreed.  Pet. App. 38a, 69-70a. \nIn addition to unanimity on the PSJVTA, federal \ncourts agree on the standards for jurisdictional due \nprocess under the Fifth Amendment.  Every circuit to \nreach the issue agrees that the minimum contacts and \nconsent standards developed under the Fourteenth \nAmendment apply under the Fifth Amendment.  See \nPet. App. 49-51a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54-56; Douglass \nv. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 \n(5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cBoth Due Process Clauses \nuse the same language and serve the same purpose, \nprotecting individual liberty by guaranteeing limits \non personal jurisdiction.  Every court that has \nconsidered this point agrees that the standards mirror \neach other.\u201d); id. at 238 n.22 (collecting cases from \nvarious circuits); Herederos De Roberto Gomez \nCabrera v. Teck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th \n\n23 \n \n \nCir. 2022) (\u201cthe operative language of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments is materially identical, and \nit would be incongruous for the same words to \ngenerate markedly different doctrinal analyses\u201d).  \u201cTo \nsuppose that \u2018due process of law\u2019 meant one thing in \nthe Fifth Amendment and another in the Fourteenth \nis too frivolous to require elaborate rejection.\u201d  \nMalinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 415 (1945) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring). \nNot one case supports Petitioners\u2019 views that the \ndue process standards should be abandoned or relaxed \nunder the Fifth Amendment.  See Pet. App. 45-46a.  \nCourts \nhave \nlong \nrejected \nthe \nnotion \n\u201cthat \nfederalism\u2019s irrelevance in the Fifth Amendment \ncontext justifies a \u2018more lenient\u2019 standard for personal \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 48a; Douglass, 46 F.4th at 239 \nn.24 (collecting cases from various circuits). \n2.  Petitioners do not defend the PSJVTA on the \nbasis of consent\u2014even though the statutory language \ndepends exclusively on \u201cconsent.\u201d  Instead, Petitioners \nask this Court to opine broadly on Congress\u2019s power to \nimpose jurisdiction on Respondents. \nPetitioners give no more than lip service to the \nconcept of consent, and instead focus on whether \nCongress can legislatively impose jurisdiction on \nRespondents if they do not comply with Congress\u2019s \ndemands.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 17-19; Pl. Pet. 23-25.  They ask \nonly if it is \u201cfair\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d to \u201cassert\u201d personal \njurisdiction over Respondents.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 20-22; Pl. \nPet. 20, 24, 26.  The amici are similarly adamant in \nasking this Court to decide that question, rather than \naddressing consent.  Grassley Amicus Br. 17; House \nAmicus Br. 11; Sofaer Amicus Br. 3.  But that is not \nthe question presented by the PSJVTA, which is \nwhether Respondents can be constitutionally deemed \nto have consented to jurisdiction.  This Court should \n\n24 \n \n \nnot accept certiorari to decide if Congress has powers \nit did not purport to exercise.   \nThe court of appeals correctly considered the statute \non its own terms\u2014and through this Court\u2019s consent \ncases\u2014cases that Petitioners largely disregard.  \nPetitioners, instead, rely on minimum contacts cases \nlike Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 139 (2014), \nand Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, \n471-72 (1985).  Their reliance on hornbook minimum \ncontacts cases to establish the standard applicable to \nconsent \nunder \nthe \nPSJVTA \nhighlights \nthe \ninconsistency at the heart of their petitions.   \nPetitioners\u2019 theories also undermine this Court\u2019s \ndue process cases.  If Petitioners are correct, Congress \ncould circumvent those cases by enacting statutes \ndeclaring that the same activities already held \nconstitutionally insufficient to confer jurisdiction \nshall be deemed as consent.  Under Daimler, for \nexample, a California court could not exercise \njurisdiction over a foreign car manufacturer and its \nU.S. subsidiary, which distributed vehicles to \nCalifornia dealerships, but were incorporated and \nmaintained their principal places of business \nelsewhere.  571 U.S. at 139.  Despite achieving \n\u201csizable\u201d sales in the state, the Court held that \ndefendants\u2019 activities were insufficient for general \njurisdiction because they were not \u201cessentially at \nhome\u201d in the forum.  Id.  Under Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, \nCongress could declare that any foreign corporation \nthat distributed vehicles to California dealerships \n\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d in the state.   \n \n \n\n25 \n \n \nB. \nThe petitions fail to raise an issue of \nexceptional practical importance.   \nNot only do the decisions below have no legal \nimportance except to the parties, they also have no \nbroader practical importance.  The PSJVTA does not \napply to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State, or any \nother terrorist groups or state-sponsors of terrorism.  \nAs the Government concedes, the decisions apply only \nto two sui generis entities over which the courts have \nrepeatedly rejected personal jurisdiction.  The facts in \nthese cases also do not raise uniquely American \nconcerns.  Respondents are not headquartered here, \nand the attacks at issue were random attacks, not \naimed at Americans.   \nAs the Solicitor General explained earlier in this \ncase, \u201cnothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants \nunder the broader due process principles the courts \nhave recognized in cases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Resp. App. 24a.  The ATA still \u201cpermits \nU.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants \naccused of targeting U.S. citizens in an act of \ninternational terrorism\u201d or where \u201cthe United States \nwas the focal point of the harm caused by the \ndefendant\u2019s participation in or support for overseas \nterrorism.\u201d  Id.  The ATA also applies to defendants \n\u201cconducting activity in the United States, by, for \nexample, making use of U.S. financial institutions to \nsupport international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  The opinions \nbelow do not affect \u201ccases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Id.  In sum, ATA jurisdiction is present \nwhere attacks are targeted at America or U.S. citizens, \nor are planned or financed in the United States.  \n\n26 \n \n \nThe political branches have a robust arsenal of \nantiterrorism tools unconstrained by the decisions \nbelow, including criminal prosecutions, sanctions, \nasset freezes, export controls, and the use of force.  \nCongress has recognized that ATA criminal cases \nmore directly advance the government\u2019s interests in \nantiterrorism law enforcement than their civil \ncounterparts.  See 138 Cong. Rec. S17254-01, S17260, \n1992 \nWL \n308152 \n(daily \ned. \nOct. \n7, \n1992); \nAntiterrorism Act of 1990: Hearing on S. 2465 Before \nthe S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 46-47 \n(1990).  As such, \u201cadher[ence] to the status quo of \npersonal jurisdiction doctrine\u201d in civil ATA cases \n\u201cdo[es] not diminish any law-enforcement tools that \ncurrently exist.\u201d  Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  \nNor does the result below prevent Plaintiffs from \nbringing suit in an appropriate forum.  Israeli courts \nallow suits by Americans who are injured in Israel.  A \ncourt recently awarded damages against Respondents \nto two Americans injured in a 1985 PLF attack. 11  \nIsrael also allows large damage awards, including a \n$100 million award against Respondents for injuries \nduring the Second Intifada.12  Another Israeli court \nfound Respondents liable for welfare payments in \n \n11 JNS Wire, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to Achille Lauro \nHijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), https://www.jns.org/wire/plo-\nordered-to-pay-compensation-to-achille-lauro-hijacking-\nvictims/; Shurat Hadin, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to \n1985 Achille Lauro Hijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), \nhttps://israellawcenter.org/legal_actions/plo-ordered-to-pay-\ncompensation-to-1985-achille-lauro-hijacking-vicitms/.  \n12 Jerusalem Post, Terror victims\u2019 families to collect NIS 500 m. \nfrom Palestinian Authority (Apr. 26, 2020), https://www. \njpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/court-orders-collection-of-nis-500-\nm-from-pa-for-second-intifada-625930; \nNorz\u2019its \nLitbac \nv. \nPalestinian Auth.

This case is a poor vehicle to resolve the \nconstitutionality of the PSJVTA.  \nBoth Fuld and Sokolow have significant issues \npreventing this Court from providing the relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  Among other things, Petitioners\u2019 \nhands are tied by estoppel, waiver, and forfeiture.  As \na result, these cases are poor vehicles, especially since \nthe Court will have future opportunities to address \nthe PSJVTA in cases currently pending in other \ncircuits. \nA. \nThese cases face unique case-specific \nchallenges.   \n1.  The Fuld plaintiffs are estopped from obtaining \nrelief.  They pursued various defendants on \ninconsistent theories, claiming each was responsible \nfor the same attack.  But they recently secured a $191 \nmillion judgment on the basis that Iran and Syria \naided Hamas, which was \u201cthe terror organization that \ncarried out the attack.\u201d  Fuld v. Islamic Republic of \nIran, No. 20-2444, 2024 WL 1328790, *1, *4 (D.D.C. \nMar. 28, 2024).  The court accepted plaintiffs\u2019 position, \nholding the attacker was \u201crecruited to Hamas through \nhis high school,\u201d and the attack \u201cwas planned and \n \n13 Times of Israel, High Court: PA liable for terrorism due to \nmoney it pays attackers; victims can sue (Apr. 10, 2022), \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-pa-liable-for-\nterrorism-due-to-stipends-to-attackers-victims-can-sue/; \nAnon. \nv. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivA 2362/19 (Jerusalem 2022); \nMentin v. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivC 3361/09 (Jerusalem \n2017). \n \n\n28 \n \n \ncarried out by the Al-Qassam Brigades\u2014the Hamas \nterrorist branch.\u201d  Id. at *4-6. \nThe plaintiffs also convinced the court that the \nattack was a stroke against Respondents\u2019 legitimacy, \nintended to mark \u201cthe 15th anniversary of the Oslo \nAccords\u2014an agreement Hamas seeks to eradicate.\u201d  \nId. at *5.  Respondents are the enemies and \u201cbitter \nrivals\u201d of Hamas, id. at *4, and were recognized or \nestablished by the Oslo Accords.  The attack, plaintiffs \nclaimed, was \u201cintended to protest against the security \ncooperation between Israel and Fatah and the \nPalestinian Authority.\u201d  Fuld v. Iran Doc. 27-3 at 50. \nGiven that successful position and resulting \njudgment, it would be illogical and inconsistent for \nPlaintiffs to also claim that Respondents were \nactually responsible for the attack.  New Hampshire v. \nMaine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (estoppel prohibits \n\u201cparties \nfrom \ndeliberately \nchanging \npositions \naccording to the exigencies of the moment\u201d). \n2.  Sokolow is also a poor vehicle.  Filed in 2004, it \nwent through discovery and a jury verdict, but was \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction in 2016.  \nAfter it became final, the Sokolow plaintiffs asked the \ncourt of appeals to recall its mandate.  The court, \nhowever, held in 2019 that its \u201cinterest in finality ... \nweighs against recalling the mandate.\u201d  Pet. App. 132-\n35a. \u201cRecalling the mandate now would offend \u2018the \nneed to preserve finality in judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nIt noted the plaintiffs had another case that would be \nthe appropriate forum for litigating the PSJVTA.  Id. \nat 135a n.2.  More time has passed, and Sokolow has \nnow been final for eight years. \nBut even if Sokolow is resurrected, its jury verdict \ncannot be.  As explained in Burnham v. Superior Ct. \nof California, 495 U.S. 604, 608-09 (1990), the limited \nnature of the judicial power means that \u201cthe judgment \n\n29 \n \n \nof a court lacking jurisdiction is void.\u201d  Both \n\u201cproceedings\u201d \nand \n\u201cjudgments\u201d \nmade \nwithout \npersonal jurisdiction are \u201cnot simply erroneous, but \nabsolutely void.\u201d  Roman Cath. Archdiocese of San \nJuan v. Feliciano, 589 U.S. 57, 64 (2020) (cleaned up).  \nAnd even if this case were to survive, there are still \nissues remaining from the original appeal, including \nimproper expert testimony.  Pet. App. 141-42a; see \nGilmore v. Palestinian Auth., 843 F.3d 958, 972-73 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (affirming judgment for Respondents \nafter excluding one such expert\u2019s testimony).   \n3.  This Court will have multiple chances to accept \ncertiorari \nin \nthe future, \nbenefiting from \nthe \nperspectives of other circuits.  The Tenth Circuit case \nmentioned above is currently set for oral argument on \nNovember 19, 2024 (Nos. 23-1286, 23-1335), and \nanother PSJVTA case is pending in D.C. district court \n(No. 04-1173).    \nB. \nEver-changing theories of due process \nand original meaning create waiver \nproblems.  \nThe Petitioners also cannot avoid the results of their \nprior inconsistent positions.  Plaintiffs have forfeited \ntheir originalism arguments, and the Government \nproposes a new and different due process theory \nbefore this Court.  Plaintiffs\u2019 forfeited originalism \narguments remain, as might be expected, slapdash, \nunder-developed, and unready for this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments about due process and \noriginal meaning were forfeited.  They did not raise \narguments about the original understanding at the \ntrial court level in either Fuld or Sokolow.  On appeal, \nonly the Fuld plaintiffs raised originalism, and they \ndid so only to argue for a \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cnexus\u201d standard \nunder the Fifth Amendment\u2014not the extreme due-\nprocess-does-not-include-jurisdiction approach found \n\n30 \n \n \nfor the first time in their petition.  See Fuld C.A. Pl. \nBr. Doc. 67 at 49, 61.  The Second Circuit, not \nsurprisingly given the forfeiture, did not address \noriginalism.  \nThis Court should decline to review Plaintiffs\u2019 new \noriginalism argument as it was doubly forfeited.  See \nOBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 \n(2015) (\u201c[t]hat argument was never presented to any \nlower court and is therefore forfeited\u201d); Adams v. \nRobertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86 (1997) (dismissing \ncertiorari as improvidently granted when petitioners \nfailed the \u201cburden of showing that the issue was \nproperly presented\u201d below). \nThe Government has also significantly changed its \nposition on due process.  It successfully argued for the \nestablished \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d standard in both \ntrial and appellate courts.  See Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. \n73 at 21; Sokolow C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 447 at 19.  Only \nafter losing under that very same standard did the \nGovernment begin to argue for the new fairness-only \napproach found in its Petition, where consent is just \none of the \u201cconsiderations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 16, 21.  Below, \nthe Government argued for clear distinctions between \nconsent jurisdiction and imposed jurisdiction.  Fuld \nC.A. Gov\u2019t Reply Doc. 162 at 5.  Here, for the first time, \nthe Government proposes to replace longstanding due \nprocess standards for consent jurisdiction with the \n\u201cflexible\u201d \nbut \nentirely \ndifferent \nstandards \nfor \nprocedural due process.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 14, 20.   \n2.  The need for further development of Plaintiffs\u2019 \noriginalism arguments is reflected in the many errors \nin their petition.  Plaintiffs cite the Constitution\u2019s \nexpress grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction in \nadmiralty and maritime cases as evidence of \n\u201cextraterritorial power\u201d being a \u201cdeliberate feature of \nthe constitutional plan.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 16-17.  It is precisely \n\n31 \n \n \nthe opposite; the Constitution expressly confers \nextraterritorial jurisdiction in limited cases to the \nexclusion of others.  See The Federalist No. 80 (federal \njurisdiction extends to cases that \u201coriginate on the \nhigh seas, and are of admiralty or maritime \njurisdiction\u201d); Constit., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 10; Art. III, \nSec. 2, cl. 1.  Had the Framers understood federal \njurisdiction to be unconstrained by national borders \nas Plaintiffs contend, these explicit provisions of \njurisdiction would be superfluous.   \nAccordingly, early scholars believed federal courts\u2019 \njurisdiction was circumscribed by \u201ca sovereign\u2019s power \n[which] was limited to activities occurring within its \nterritory.\u201d  Lea Brilmayer & Charles Norchi, Federal \nExtraterritoriality and Fifth Amendment Due Process, \n105 Harv. L. Rev. 1217, 1224-25 (1992); Joseph Story, \nCommentaries on the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 539 (1834) \n(\u201c[J]urisdiction, to be rightfully exercised, must be \nfounded either upon the person being within the \nterritory, or the thing being within the territory; for, \notherwise, there can be no sovereignty exerted.\u201d).  \nIndeed, \u201cleading writers on international law who \ninformed the Framers\u2019 views ... regarded universal \njurisdiction as aberrational or problematic.\u201d  Eugene \nKontorovich, The \u2018Define And Punish\u2019 Clause And The \nLimits Of Universal Jurisdiction, 103 Nw. U.L. Rev. \n149, 174 (2009).   \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, this Court has \ncontinually acknowledged limits on jurisdiction over \nforeign persons.  As early as 1808, Chief Justice \nMarshall recognized that \u201cthe legislation of every \ncountry is territorial; that beyond its own territory, it \ncan only affect its own subjects or citizens.\u201d  Rose v. \nHimely, 8 U.S. 241, 279 (1808); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 \nU.S. 264, 295 (1821) (\u201clegislative power has no \noperation, beyond the territorial limits under its \nauthority\u201d); see also Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, \n\n32 \n \n \n611-12 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (\u201c[N]o sovereignty can \nextend its process beyond its territorial limits, to \nsubject either persons or property to its judicial \ndecisions.\u201d).   \n\u201cThe jurisdiction of courts is a branch of that which \nis possessed by the nation as an independent \nsovereign power\u201d and that sovereignty is \u201cincapable of \nconferring extra-territorial power.\u201d  The Schooner \nExch. v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 136-37 (1812); The \nApollon, 22 U.S. 362, 370 (1824) (\u201cThe laws of no \nnation can justly extend beyond its own territories, \u2026 \nhowever general and comprehensive the phrases used \nin our municipal laws may be, they must always be \nrestricted in construction, to places and persons, upon \nwhom \nthe \nLegislature \nhave \nauthority \nand \njurisdiction.\u201d).  \nGuided by an academic, Plaintiffs erroneously \nclaim Justice Story held that \u201cthe federal courts\u201d \nwould be \u201cbound to follow\u201d any statute imposing \njurisdiction on anyone \u201cfrom the other end of the \nglobe.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 15, 19 (quoting Picquet).  But \u201c[e]ven \nunder the act of Congress, judgments must appear to \nbe rendered by courts having jurisdiction of the \nparties, as well as the cause.\u201d  Aspden v. Nixon, 45 \nU.S. 467, 484 (1846).  Picquet is not to the contrary, as \nit addressed Congress\u2019s power to allow a court to \nattach and execute on property within its territorial \njurisdiction.  19 F. Cas. at 615.  Picquet, in fact, \nrepeatedly warns that jurisdiction could not extend \noutside national boundaries.  Id. at 611 (\u201cEven the \ncourt of king\u2019s bench in England, though a court of \ngeneral jurisdiction, never imagined, that it could \nserve process in Scotland, Ireland, or the colonies, to \ncompel an appearance, or justify a judgment against \npersons residing therein at the time of the \ncommencement of the suit.\u201d).  \n\n33 \n \n \nPlaintiffs\u2019 loose approach to the Constitution and \nhistory underscores the need for further consideration \nof these issues in the lower courts.   \n \nC. \nPetitioners fail to address separation of \npowers.   \nThough these cases were resolved on due process \ngrounds, Respondents raised separation of powers at \nevery stage.  Petitioners fail to address this significant \nconstitutional roadblock.   \nCongress overstepped its constitutional authority \nwith the PSJVTA by attempting to \u201cusurp a court\u2019s \npower to interpret and apply the law to the \ncircumstances before it.\u201d  Bank Markazi v. Peterson, \n578 U.S. 212, 224-28 (2016) (cleaned up); United \nStates v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128, 147 (1871) (overturning \nstatute \nrequiring \ncourts \nto \ntreat \npardons \nof \nConfederate sympathizers as conclusive evidence of \ndisloyalty).  The PSJVTA usurps the judicial function \nby directing courts to always find consent if its factual \npredicates \nare \nmet\u2014regardless \nof \nwhether \nconstitutional standards for consent are satisfied.  \nDetermining the waiver of constitutional rights is a \nquintessentially \njudicial \nquestion, \nrequiring \n\u201capplication of constitutional principles to the facts as \nfound.\u201d  Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977).  \nThat is particularly so when consent to jurisdiction \nrequires a \u201cdeeply factbound analysis.\u201d  Wellness Int\u2019l, \n575 U.S. at 685-86. \nThe PSJVTA also violates the principle that \nCongress cannot \u201clegislatively supersede\u201d decisions \n\u201cinterpreting \nand \napplying \nthe \nConstitution.\u201d  \nDickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 437 (2000).  \nThe Second and D.C. Circuits previously held that \nfinding personal jurisdiction based on the same course \n\n34 \n \n \nof conduct alleged here violates due process.  \nPermitting Congress to supersede those holdings by \nre-labeling that conduct as \u201cconsent\u201d would violate \nseparation of powers.  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 \nU.S. 507, 523-24 (1997) (rejecting Congressional effort \nto overturn precedent by creating a different \nconstitutional standard).  As one judge explained, \nCongress cannot take \u201cconduct that the Second and \nD.C. Circuits had held was insufficient to support \npersonal jurisdiction \u2026 and declare[] that such \nconduct \u2018shall be deemed\u2019 to be consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.  Pet.

In the view of the United States, \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a.  Petitioners are United States citizens, and the \nguardians, family members, and personal representa-\ntives of the estates of United States citizens, who were \ninjured or killed in seven terrorist attacks in or near Je-\nrusalem.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  In 2004, petitioners filed suit \nagainst respondents Palestinian Authority (PA) and \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA), which provides a \nright of action to United States nationals and their es-\ntates, survivors, or heirs for injuries caused by acts of \n7a\n                     (1)\n\n2 \n \ninternational terrorism. 18 U.S.C. 2333(a).  Respond-\nents moved to dismiss the claims for lack of personal ju-\nrisdiction.  See Pet. App. 5a.   \nThe district court denied respondents\u2019 motion, hold-\ning that it had general jurisdiction over respondents.  \nPet. App. 52a-74a.  The court framed the jurisdictional \ninquiry as \u201cwhether a defendant has minimum contacts \nwith the forum\u201d sufficient to justify maintenance of the \nsuit and \u201cwhether it would be reasonable, under the cir-\ncumstances of the particular case, to exercise jurisdic-\ntion over the defendant.\u201d  Id. at 60a.  The court reasoned \nthat respondents\u2019 \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d pres-\nence in the United States was sufficient to support gen-\neral jurisdiction, and that respondents could therefore \nbe sued in the United States on all claims, regardless of \nwhether the claims concerned respondents\u2019 conduct \nwithin the United States.  Id. at 61a.  The court empha-\nsized that respondents \u201cpurposely engaged in numer-\nous activities\u201d here, including commercial and public-\nrelations activities, and that respondents maintained an \noffice in Washington, D.C.  Id. at 62a; see id. at 63a-65a.  \nThe court also concluded that exercising personal juris-\ndiction over respondents was reasonable in light of \u201ctra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  Id. \nat 72a (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nRespondents moved for reconsideration after this \nCourt \u201csignificantly narrowed the general personal ju-\nrisdiction test in [Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. \n746 (2014)].\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  The district court denied \nthe motion.  Id. at 75a-81a.  The court stated that re-\nspondents were effectively \u201cat home in the United \nStates\u201d because their activities here were \u201ccontinuous \nand systematic.\u201d  Id. at 77a.  And the court stated that \nit did not have \u201cany basis to believe\u201d that respondents \n8a\n\n3 \n \nwere engaged in more continuous or systematic activi-\nties in any other country.  Id. at 77a.  Respondents \nraised their jurisdictional arguments again in seeking \nsummary judgment.  Ibid. The court denied that mo-\ntion, rejecting respondents\u2019 argument that their con-\ntacts with the United States were insufficient to support \ngeneral jurisdiction under Daimler.  Id. at 82a-87a.   \nb. The district court permitted claims concerning six \nterrorist attacks to proceed to a jury trial.  Pet. App. 9a \nn.4.  Petitioners presented evidence linking respond-\nents to each of the attacks, id. at 9a-11a, 35a-36a, but \n\u201cdid not allege or submit evidence that [petitioners or \ntheir decedents] were targeted in any of the six attacks \nat issue because of their United States citizenship or \nthat [respondents] engaged in conduct in the United \nStates related to the attacks,\u201d id. at 15a.   \nThe jury found respondents civilly liable for the six \nattacks under several theories.  It concluded that, for all \nof the attacks, respondents had provided material sup-\nport or resources.  Pet. App. 35a.  It also concluded that, \nfor five of the attacks, respondents were responsible \nbased on respondeat-superior principles because a PA \npolice officer or other PA employee had either carried \nout the attack or provided material support or re-\nsources for the attack.  Ibid.  The jury further concluded \nthat, in connection with three of the attacks, respond-\nents knowingly provided material support to organiza-\ntions designated by the State Department as foreign \nterrorist organizations, and members of those organiza-\ntions carried out the attacks.  Id. at 36a.  Finally, the \njury concluded for one of the attacks that respondents \nhad harbored or concealed a person that they knew or \nhad reasonable grounds to believe was involved with the \nattacks.  Ibid.  The jury awarded petitioners damages \n9a\n\n4 \n \nof $218.5 million, which were increased to $655.5 million \nunder the ATA\u2019s treble-damages provision.  Id. at 6a; \nsee 18 U.S.C. 2333(a). \n2. The court of appeals vacated and remanded the \ncase to the district court with instructions to dismiss pe-\ntitioners\u2019 suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. \n1a-51a.   \nAs an initial matter, the court of appeals rejected pe-\ntitioners\u2019 argument that respondents have no due pro-\ncess rights because respondents \u201care foreign govern-\nments and share many of the attributes typically asso-\nciated with a sovereign government.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see \nid. at 19a-20a.  The court acknowledged that it had held \nthat \u201c[f\u200a]oreign sovereign states do not have due process \nrights,\u201d and instead enjoy the protections against suit \nafforded by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of \n1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1602 et seq.  Pet. App. 19a (citing \nFrontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the \nAzerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 398-401 (2d Cir. \n2009)).  But the court explained that \u201cneither the PLO \nnor the PA is recognized by the United States as a sov-\nereign state, and the executive\u2019s determination of such \nmatter is conclusive.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citing Zivotofsky v. \nKerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2088 (2015)).  The court noted \nthat petitioners had pointed to no decision \u201cindicating \nthat a non-sovereign entity with governmental attrib-\nutes lacks due process rights.\u201d  Id. at 19a-20a. \nThe court of appeals next turned to whether the ex-\nercise of personal jurisdiction over respondents was \nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  In analyzing that question, the court re-\njected petitioners\u2019 argument that the principles of gen-\neral and specific jurisdiction developed in the context of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause were \n10a\n\n5 \n \ninapplicable because the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cis \ngrounded in concepts of federalism [and] was intended \nto referee jurisdictional conflicts among the sovereign \nStates.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court explained that its \n\u201cprecedents clearly establish the congruence of due \nprocess analysis under both the Fourteenth and Fifth \nAmendments.\u201d  Id. at 22a.  The \u201cprincipal difference,\u201d \nthe court further explained, \u201cis that under the Fifth \nAmendment the court can consider the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts throughout the United States, while under the \nFourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the fo-\nrum state may be considered.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that it \u201cha[d] already applied Four-\nteenth Amendment principles to Fifth Amendment civil \nterrorism cases,\u201d among others.  Id. at 22a-23a (citing \nIn re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, \n673-674 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S.

Pet. App. 25a-32a.  It explained that \u201c[a] \ncourt may assert general personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant to hear any and all claims against that \ndefendant only when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with \nthe State in which suit is brought \u2018are so constant and \npervasive as to render [it] essentially at home in the fo-\nrum State.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at 24a (internal quotation marks omit-\nted; brackets in original) (quoting Daimler, 134  \nS. Ct. at 751).  The court concluded that \u201coverwhelming \nevidence\u201d showed that respondents were at home in the \n11a\n\n6 \n \nWest Bank and in Gaza.  Id. at 27a.  In contrast, re-\nspondents\u2019 activities in the United States were more \nlimited and resembled \u201cthose rejected as insufficient by \nthe Supreme Court in Daimler.\u201d  Id. at 28a. \nThe court of appeals also found respondents\u2019 con-\ntacts with the United States insufficient for purposes of \nspecific jurisdiction\u2014a question that petitioners had in-\nvited the court to address even though the district court \nhad not decided that issue.  Pet. App. 32a-50a; see Pet. \nC.A. Br. 32-33; see also Pet. App. 32a (finding specific \njurisdiction \u201csufficiently briefed and argued to allow \n[the court] to reach that issue\u201d).  The court concluded \nthat respondents\u2019 actions relating to the six terrorist at-\ntacks at issue did not create \u201ca substantial connection\u201d \nto the United States.  Pet. App. 32a (quoting Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014)).  \u201cWhile the plaintiff-\nvictims were United States citizens,\u201d id. at 33a, the \ncourt explained that the residence or citizenship of vic-\ntims alone \u201cis an insufficient basis for specific jurisdic-\ntion over the defendants,\u201d id. at 36a; see id. at 39a (dis-\ncussing Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1119).  The court also de-\ntermined that there was \u201cno basis to conclude that [re-\nspondents] participated in these acts in the United \nStates or that their liability for these acts resulted from \ntheir actions that did occur in the United States.\u201d  Id. at \n36a.  And it rejected petitioners\u2019 contention that re-\nspondents had aimed their conduct at the United States \nby targeting U.S. citizens, because it determined that \npetitioners\u2019 own evidence established that the attacks \nwere indiscriminate\u2014not targeted at Americans.  Id. at \n37a-39a; see id. at 45a.  The court contrasted petition-\ners\u2019 suit with previous ATA cases, which it noted had \ninvolved more extensive forum-related conduct.  Id. at \n40a-49a. \n12a\n\n7 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nPrivate actions under the Anti-Terrorism Act are an \nimportant means of fighting terrorism and providing re-\ndress for the victims of terrorist attacks and their fam-\nilies.  The court of appeals held here, however, that this \nparticular action is barred by constitutional constraints \non the exercise of personal jurisdiction because the dis-\ntrict court had neither general nor specific jurisdiction \nover respondents in this suit arising from overseas ter-\nrorist attacks.  Petitioners challenge that conclusion on \nthree grounds:  they argue that respondents lack any \nrights at all under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment (Pet. 22-27); in the alternative the court of \nappeals erred in applying principles of personal juris-\ndiction developed under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to assess jurisdiction under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Pet. \n27-30); and in any event the court of appeals erred in its \napplication of specific-jurisdiction principles to the facts \nof this case (Pet. 30-34).  The court of appeals\u2019 rejection \nof those arguments does not conflict with any decision \nof this Court, implicate any conflict among the courts of \nappeals, or otherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention \nat this time. \n1. The court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that respondents \nare entitled to due process protections does not warrant \nthis Court\u2019s review. \na. The court of appeals\u2019 determination does not con-\nflict with any decision of this Court.  The Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments prohibit the federal govern-\nment and the States, respectively, from depriving any \n\u201cperson\u201d of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due pro-\ncess of law.\u201d  U.S. Const. Amends. V, XIV.  Due process \n13a\n\n8 \n \nrequires that \u201cin order to subject a defendant to a judg-\nment in personam,\u201d the defendant must generally have \nsufficient \u201ccontacts with [the forum] such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional no-\ntions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted); see Insurance Corp. of \nIreland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,  \n456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (explaining that the require-\nments of personal jurisdiction flow \u201cfrom the Due Pro-\ncess Clause\u201d). \nBecause the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments \u201cspeak[] only of \u2018persons,\u2019\u200a\u201d \nLivnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (citation omitted), petition for cert. pending, No. \n17-508 (filed Sept. 28, 2017), whether an entity receives \ndue process protections depends on whether the entity \nqualifies as a \u201cperson.\u201d  This Court has recognized one \nclass of entities that are not \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \ndue process:  the States of the Union.  South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-324 (1966), abrogated \non other grounds by Shelby Cnty. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. \n2612 (2013).  In reaching that result, the Court stated \nonly that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any \nreasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to en-\ncompass the States of the Union.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court has not recognized any other class of  \nentities\u2014whether natural or artificial\u2014as outside the \ncategory of \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of due process.  It \nhas treated as \u201cpersons\u201d domestic and foreign entities \nof various types, such as corporations.  See, e.g., Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316-317 (domestic corpora-\ntion); Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 750-752 \n14a\n\n9 \n \n(2014) (German public stock company); Goodyear Dun-\nlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 918-\n920 (2011) (foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. tire manufac-\nturer).  Because this Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence has \nset only States of the Union outside of the category of \n\u201cpersons,\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions do not establish that \nforeign entities like respondents are barred from invok-\ning due process protections. \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s treatment of respondents as \nentities that receive due process protections also does \nnot conflict with any decision of another court of ap-\npeals.  In fact, the decision below accords with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Livnat, supra, which also held that \nthe PA is entitled to due process protections.  851 F.3d \nat 48, 50.  Livnat appears to be the only other appellate \ndecision addressing the legal status of non-sovereign \nforeign entities that exercise governmental power.1  In \nLivnat, the D.C. Circuit understood this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Katzenbach to reflect the principle that the term \n\u201cperson\u201d excludes \u201csovereigns\u201d\u2014an understanding that \nthe court saw as consistent with common usage.  Id. at \n50 (\u201c[I]n common usage, the term \u2018person\u2019 does not in-\nclude the sovereign.\u201d) (citation omitted).  After noting \nthe distinctive attributes of sovereign entities, the D.C. \nCircuit concluded that foreign non-sovereign govern-\nmental entities like respondents do not fall outside due \nprocess protections.  Id. at 50-52.  In addition, the D.C. \nCircuit rejected the argument that the PA is outside our \ndomestic structure of government, explaining that this \n                                                     \n1 The decisions of the D.C. Circuit and the court of appeals below \naccord with a substantial number of district court decisions conclud-\ning that one or both of respondents have due process rights in the \npersonal jurisdiction context.  See Livnat v. Palestinian Auth.,  \n82 F. Supp. 3d 19, 26 (D.D.C. 2015) (compiling cases). \n15a\n\n10 \n \nCourt had consistently \u201crejected the notion that \u2018alien\u2019 \nentities\u201d\u2014such as foreign corporations\u2014\u201care disquali-\nfied from due-process protection.\u201d  Id. at 50. \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 24-25) that the de-\ncision below conflicts with federal appellate decisions \naddressing the status of foreign sovereigns.  As peti-\ntioners note (Pet. 24), the Second and D.C. Circuits have \nheld that foreign sovereigns lack due process rights\u2014a \nquestion on which this Court reserved decision in Re-\npublic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 \n(1992) (assessing personal jurisdiction over Argentina \nunder specific-jurisdiction principles, while \u201c[a]ssum-\ning, without deciding, that a foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 \nfor purposes of the Due Process Clause\u201d).  See Frontera \nRes. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan \nRepublic, 582 F.3d 393, 399-400 (2d Cir. 2009); Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 95-100 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  But as noted above, the Sec-\nond and D.C. Circuits have recognized that the reason-\ning of those decisions is limited to sovereigns, and they \nhave held that non-sovereign foreign entities like re-\nspondents do receive due process protections.  Pet. App. \n19a-20a; see Livnat, 851 F.3d at 48, 50. \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion (Pet. 24), there is \nalso no conflict between the decision below and City of \nEast St. Louis v. Circuit Court for Twentieth Judicial \nCircuit, 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993), which indi-\ncated that municipalities lack due process rights.  As \nLivnat observed, City of East St. Louis rested on the \n\u201cprinciple that municipalities are creatures of a State \nand therefore lack any constitutional rights against the \nState.\u201d  851 F.3d at 53 (citing City of East St. Louis, 986 \nF.2d at 1144, and discussing cases cited therein, includ-\ning City of Newark v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 192, 196 \n16a\n\n11 \n \n(1923)).  That rationale does not extend to foreign enti-\nties like respondents.  The court of appeals\u2019 treatment \nof respondents as subject to due process protections \ntherefore does not implicate any conflict.2 \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 21) that this Court should \ndecide whether respondents are entitled to due process \nprotections in the absence of a conflict because the de-\ncision below may \u201cinterfere with the Executive\u2019s  \nforeign-affairs prerogatives.\u201d  In the view of the United \nStates, petitioners\u2019 approach poses a greater threat of \nsuch interference.  The power to recognize foreign gov-\nernments is exclusively vested in the President.  Zivo-\ntofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2086 (2015); see ibid. \n(\u201cRecognition is a topic on which the Nation must speak  \n. . .  with one voice.\u201d) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The President\u2019s recognition of a for-\neign state \u201cis a \u2018formal acknowledgement\u2019 that a partic-\nular \u2018entity possesses the qualifications for statehood\u2019 \n                                                     \n2  Petitioners overread the United States\u2019 1988 brief in a case in \nwhich the Palestine Information Office (PIO) challenged an order \nissued by the State Department under the Foreign Missions Act,  \n22 U.S.C. 4301 et seq., and Article II directing the PIO\u2014an agent of \nthe PLO\u2014to cease operations.  See Pet. Reply Br. 7.  The govern-\nment\u2019s brief argued that the court of appeals should reject the \nPLO\u2019s claims of a First Amendment violation because sovereign en-\ntities lack constitutional rights and the PLO was asserting that it \nwas a sovereign entity.  See Pet. Reply App. 41a (\u201cForeign political \nentities such as the PLO, which purport to be sovereign entities, \nhave no constitutional rights.\u201d); id. at 45a (\u201cBecause the PLO pur-\nports to be an independent foreign entity, it has no constitutional \nrights.\u201d); see also id. at 57a (similarly rejecting procedural due pro-\ncess claim).  The government\u2019s argument rested on the incompati-\nbility of the PLO\u2019s assertion of sovereign status with its claim of \nFirst Amendment rights, not on an independent determination that \nthe PLO\u2019s governmental attributes rendered it the equivalent of a \nsovereign.   \n17a\n\n12 \n \nor \u2018that a particular regime is the effective government \nof a state,\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2084 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) \nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 203 \ncmt. a (1987))\u2014not merely a determination that the \nUnited States will \u201caccord [a government] certain ben-\nefits,\u201d Pet. 26.  An approach under which courts would \nassess the extent to which foreign entities operate as \n\u201cthe effective government of a state\u201d or \u201cpossess[] the \nqualifications for statehood,\u201d Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at \n2084 (citation omitted), risks judicial determinations at \nodds with Presidential determinations underlying rec-\nognition. \nc. The Court has not seen any need to revisit the \nscope of the term \u201cperson\u201d under the Due Process \nClauses since Katzenbach, and in any event this case \nwould not be an appropriate vehicle for doing so for two \nreasons.  First, petitioners\u2019 argument relies (Pet. 23-24) \non analogizing respondents to foreign sovereigns and \nmunicipalities, but this Court has not yet passed upon \nthe status of those entities for due process purposes.  \nSecond, because respondents are sui generis entities \nwith a unique relationship to the United States govern-\nment, a ruling on whether respondents have due pro-\ncess protections is unlikely to have broad utility in re-\nsolving future cases concerning other entities.  See Pet. \n8-9 (stating that respondents are not recognized as sov-\nereign by the United States but \u201cinteract with the \nUnited States as a foreign government,\u201d \u201cemploy \u2018for-\neign agents\u2019\u200a\u201d that are registered \u201cas agents of the \u2018Gov-\nernment of a foreign country\u2019\u200a\u201d under the Foreign \nAgents Registration Act of 1938, 22 U.S.C. 611, and \n\u201chave received over a billion dollars\u201d from the United \nStates in \u201cgovernment-to-government assistance\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted). \n18a\n\n13 \n \n2. Certiorari is also not warranted to consider peti-\ntioners\u2019 novel argument that federal courts may exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment \nwhenever \u201ca defendant\u2019s conduct interfered with U.S. \nsovereign interests as set out in a federal statute, and \nthe defendant was validly served with process in the \nUnited States pursuant to a nationwide-service-of- \nprocess provision.\u201d  Pet. Reply Br. 11 (emphasis omit-\nted). \na. The court of appeals\u2019 rejection of petitioners\u2019 \nFifth Amendment theory does not conflict with any de-\ncision of this Court.  This Court has explained that due \nprocess requires \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d with the \nforum \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not \noffend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting \nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  In cases \narising under the Fourteenth Amendment, principles of \ngeneral jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued for \nany conduct in a forum where their contacts are \u201cso \n\u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render them essen-\ntially at home.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919.  Principles \nof specific jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued in \na forum where they are not essentially at home if there \nis \u201can affiliation between the forum and the underlying \ncontroversy, principally [an] activity or an occurrence \nthat takes place in the forum State.\u201d  Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Superior Court, 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017) \n(brackets in original) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).  \nIn the context of an intentional tort, a court may exer-\ncise specific jurisdiction over a defendant who has \u201cex-\npressly aimed\u201d tortious actions at the forum\u2014including \nby committing a tortious act with \u201ckn[owledge] that the \nbrunt of th[e] injury would be felt\u201d there.  Calder v. \n19a\n\n14 \n \nJones, 465 U.S. 783, 789-790 (1984); see Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1123 (2014).  But a court may not \nexercise specific jurisdiction merely because a defend-\nant could foresee that his conduct would have some ef-\nfect in the forum.  Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-790. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s reliance on these principles de-\nveloped in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nassess the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 contacts under \nthe Fifth Amendment does not conflict with any deci-\nsion of this Court.  This Court has repeatedly reserved \nthe question whether the limitations on personal juris-\ndiction under the Fifth Amendment differ from the lim-\nitations under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bristol- \nMyers, 137 S. Ct. at 1783-1784; Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. \nv. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 (1987); see \nalso J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n885 (2011) (plurality opinion); Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 n.* (1987) (opinion of \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Recent personal jurisdiction cases aris-\ning in federal district courts have not presented that \nquestion because \u201c[f]ederal courts ordinarily follow \nstate law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction \nover persons.\u201d  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 753; see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(k)(1)(A) (authorizing service of process on a \ndefendant \u201cwho is subject to the jurisdiction of a court \nof general jurisdiction in the state where the district \ncourt is located\u201d). \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s approach to jurisdiction un-\nder the Fifth Amendment also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Statutes such as \nthe ATA present questions concerning Fifth Amend-\nment jurisdictional limitations because they contain na-\ntionwide service-of-process and venue provisions that \n20a\n\n15 \n \npermit a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over de-\nfendants who would not be subject to suit in the courts \nof the State in which the federal court is located.   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A) and (C) (authorizing service of \nprocess on a defendant who is not \u201csubject to the juris-\ndiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state \nwhere the district court is located\u201d if service is \u201cauthor-\nized by a federal statute\u201d); 18 U.S.C. 2334(a) (providing \nthat an ATA defendant \u201cmay be served in any district \nwhere the defendant resides, is found, or has an agent\u201d).   \nIn analyzing such statutes, courts of appeals gener-\nally have adapted Fourteenth Amendment jurisdic-\ntional principles to the Fifth Amendment context in the \nmanner that the court below did: by considering a de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the Nation as a whole, rather \nthan only contacts with a particular State, in deciding \nwhether the defendant had the contacts needed for per-\nsonal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Application to En-\nforce Admin. Subpoenas Duces Tecum of SEC, 87 F.3d \n413, 417 (10th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhen the personal jurisdic-\ntion of a federal court is invoked based upon a federal \nstatute providing for nationwide or worldwide service, \nthe relevant inquiry is whether the respondent has had \nsufficient minimum contacts with the United States.\u201d); \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55.3  The decision below is consistent \n                                                     \n3  See also Pet.

Pet. App. 23a-50a.  \nPetitioners point to no decision adopting their far \nbroader \u201csovereign interests\u201d theory, under which the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process limitations are satisfied \nso long as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct interfered with U.S. \nsovereign interests as set out in a federal statute, and \nthe defendant was validly served with process in the \nUnited States pursuant to a nationwide-service-of- \nprocess provision.\u201d  Pet.

And the \ncontours and implications of petitioners\u2019 jurisdictional \ntheory\u2014which turns on whether a defendant\u2019s conduct \n\u201cinterfered with U.S. sovereign interests as set out in a \nfederal statute,\u201d Pet. Reply Br. 11\u2014are not themselves \nwell developed.  Under these circumstances, further de-\nvelopment in the lower courts is likely to be useful be-\nfore this Court addresses arguments that the federal \ncourts may, in particular circumstances, exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over civil cases without regard to the \nprinciples of specific and general jurisdiction developed \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \nd. Review of petitioners\u2019 theory is not currently war-\nranted on the ground that application of Fourteenth \nAmendment-derived jurisdictional principles \u201cleaves \nthe [ATA] a practical nullity\u201d and \u201cwould bar most suits \nunder the Act based on overseas attacks.\u201d  Pet. 17.  It is \nfar from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 approach will \nforeclose many claims that would otherwise go forward \nin federal courts.  As the court of appeals explained, its \napproach permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants accused of targeting U.S. citizens in an \n                                                     \n657 F.2d 816, 820, 823-824 (6th Cir. 1981) (rejecting Alabama de-\nfendants\u2019 challenge to jurisdiction of federal court in Tennessee in \nreceivership proceeding), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 949 (1982).  The re-\nmaining decision similarly stated that aggregation of nationwide \ncontacts under the Fifth Amendment might be permissible when a \nstatute authorizes nationwide service of process, but it found no per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant because there was no ap-\nplicable statute of that kind.  Max Daetwyler Corp. v. R. Meyer, 762 \nF.2d 290, 294 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980 (1985).  None of \nthe decisions adopted a standard similar to petitioners\u2019 \u201csovereign \ninterests\u201d theory. \n23a\n\n18 \n \nact of international terrorism.  Pet. App. 45a; see Mor-\nris v. Khadr, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1335-1336 (D. Utah \n2006).  It permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction if \nthe United States was the focal point of the harm caused \nby the defendant\u2019s participation in or support for over-\nseas terrorism.  See Pet. App. 40a (discussing Mwani v. \nBin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (attack on U.S. \nembassy)); id. at 41a-43a (discussing In re Terrorist At-\ntacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. 2013) \n(overseas provision of material support expressly aimed \nat the United States when terrorist organization was \nknown to be targeting the United States), cert. denied, \n134 S. Ct. 2870 (2014)).  And the court of appeals stated \nthat it would permit U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants alleged to have purposefully availed \nthemselves of the privilege of conducting activity in the \nUnited States, by, for example, making use of U.S. fi-\nnancial institutions to support international terrorism.  \nSee id. at 46a-47a (discussing Licci v. Lebanese Cana-\ndian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161 (2d Cir. 2013)).  In addi-\ntion, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants un-\nder the broader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or inter-\nests.  See id. at 44a; accord Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  Un-\nder these circumstances, in the absence of any conflict \nor even a developed body of law addressing petitioners\u2019 \nrelatively novel theory, this Court\u2019s intervention is not \nwarranted. \n3. Finally, certiorari is not warranted to address the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 factbound application of established \nspecific-jurisdiction principles.  See Pet. 30-34.  As a \n24a\n\n19 \n \nthreshold matter, the court of appeals correctly identi-\nfied those principles.  The court analyzed whether \u201cthe \ndefendant\u2019s suit-related conduct  * * *  create[d] a sub-\nstantial connection with the forum State.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a \n(quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121); see id. at 33a \n(framing the inquiry as \u201cwhether the defendants\u2019 suit-\nrelated conduct\u2014their role in the six terror attacks at \nissue\u2014creates a substantial connection with the forum \nState pursuant to the ATA\u201d).  Petitioners misread the \ndecision below as holding that petitioners could estab-\nlish specific jurisdiction only if respondents \u201c\u200a\u2018specifi-\ncally targeted\u2019 U.S. citizens or territory.\u201d  Pet. Reply \nBr. 11 (quoting Pet. App. 45a).  The court of appeals \nstated that respondents had not \u201cspecifically targeted \nUnited States citizens,\u201d Pet. App. 45a, in distinguishing \ntwo cases invoked by petitioners, in which the defend-\nants were accused of providing material support or fi-\nnancing to terrorist organizations whose \u201cspecific aim\u201d \nwas to \u201ctarget[] the United States,\u201d or to \u201ckill Ameri-\ncans and destroy U.S. property,\u201d id. at 42a, 45a (cita-\ntions omitted); see id. at 42a-45a (discussing In re Ter-\nrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. \n2013); United States v. al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. \n2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 986 (2012)).  But the court \nof appeals recognized that specific jurisdiction may ex-\nist when \u201cthe brunt\u201d or \u201cthe focal point\u201d of the harm \nfrom an intentional tort is felt in the forum State.  Id. at \n43a (quoting Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  The court found \npetitioners\u2019 claims did not meet that standard because \nIsrael, not the United States, was \u201cthe focal point of the \ntorts alleged in this litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining disagreements with the deci-\nsion below amount to disagreements about what peti-\ntioners\u2019 evidence established.  Petitioners argue (Pet. \n25a\n\n20 \n \n31-32) that the court erred in applying principles of spe-\ncific jurisdiction because, in petitioners\u2019 view, respond-\nents expressly aimed their conduct at the United States.  \nBut the court of appeals found that the record did not \nestablish that proposition.  Rather, the court concluded, \npetitioners\u2019 \u201cown evidence establishe[d] the random \nand fortuitous nature of the terror attacks.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a.  And it observed that it is \u201cinsufficient to rely on a \ndefendant\u2019s \u2018random, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201cwith the forum to establish specific jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 37a (quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1123).   \nPetitioners similarly argue that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict \nestablishes that respondents intended\u201d to influence \nUnited States policy, because the ATA reaches only \u201cvi-\nolent acts that \u2018appear intended\u2019 either \u2018to influence the \npolicy of a government by intimidation or coercion,\u2019 \u2018to \naffect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, \nassassination, or kidnapping,\u2019 or \u2018to intimidate or coerce \na civilian population.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 31-32 (citation omitted).  \nBut the ATA covers attacks intended to influence for-\neign governments, such as Israel, as well as attacks that \nare intended (or appear intended) to influence the \nUnited States.  As a result, the jury\u2019s verdict does not \ndemonstrate that the court of appeals erred in applying \nprinciples of specific jurisdiction to the record in this case. \nIn any event, a fact-intensive dispute regarding the rec-\nord in this case does not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n26a\n\n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nJENNIFER G.

The observation contained no new facts, legal arguments, or signals regarding the Supreme Court's potential ruling. It did, however, serve to confirm and reinforce the current state of my knowledge and the critical nature of my existing uncertainties.\n\nMy current understanding of the case remains as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioners' Strong Position:** The case for the petitioners is built on a robust, three-pronged foundation, giving the Court multiple independent paths to reverse the Second Circuit.\n    1.  **The Constitutional Threshold Path:** The Chamber of Commerce's amicus brief introduced a potentially dispositive argument that the PLO and PA, as foreign political entities, are not \"persons\" entitled to Fifth Amendment due process protections. This argument, grounded in constitutional text, executive branch history, and judicial precedent (*Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya*), offers the Court a narrow \"off-ramp\" to decide the case without unsettling broader personal jurisdiction doctrine.\n    2.  **The Foreign Policy Deference Path:** The argument, originating with the Pompeo amicus brief, that the judiciary should defer to the political branches' judgment in matters of foreign policy and counterterrorism remains a powerful alternative. This allows the Court to uphold the statute as a valid exercise of Congress's and the President's authority.\n    3.  **The Jurisdictional Path:** The petitioners' core argument that the statute is a valid exercise of congressional power over jurisdiction persists. This path is now more nuanced. While *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* supports a consent-by-conduct theory, the Chamber of Commerce's brief has cautioned against an overly broad reading, making this path potentially less attractive to the Court than the others. The alternative framing\u2014that the Fifth Amendment only requires \"minimum contacts with the United States as a whole\" for foreign entities\u2014provides another specific test the Court could adopt.\n\n*   **Confirmed and Critical Uncertainty:** The recent observation explicitly confirms that my knowledge base is overwhelmingly weighted toward the petitioners and their amici. It highlights that the most significant gaps in my understanding are the counterarguments from the respondents (the PLO and PA) and the official position of the United States government. My ability to predict the outcome is severely hampered without knowing how the respondents will attempt to dismantle the petitioners' three-pronged strategy. The position of the Solicitor General is equally crucial, as their endorsement of one of the petitioners' arguments would be a powerful signal to the Court. The observation underscores that my next analytical step must be to acquire and process these missing briefs.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO) to the petitions for certiorari is a significant development, filling the primary gap in my knowledge I had previously identified. My beliefs are now substantially updated with the counterarguments from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). While my understanding of the petitioners' arguments remains stable, I now have a much more balanced and adversarial view of the legal landscape.\n\nMy updated understanding is as follows:\n\n*   **The Petitioners' Three Paths to Victory Now Face Direct Rebuttals:** The respondents' brief systematically attacks each of the three potential avenues for reversal I had previously identified.\n    1.  **The Jurisdictional Path (Consent-by-Conduct):** This path is now significantly weakened. The respondents argue that the Second Circuit's decision was a \"straightforward application\" of Supreme Court precedent, particularly *Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee* and *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* They contend that consent must be knowing and voluntary, reflecting a submission to the court's jurisdiction. They frame the PSJVTA's \"deemed consent\" as a \"legal fiction\" because the predicate conduct (e.g., payments made entirely in Palestine) has no connection to the United States forum and has already been held by courts to be insufficient for jurisdiction. Crucially, they distinguish *Mallory* by arguing that unlike a corporation that receives the benefit of doing business in a state in exchange for consent, the PLO and PA are legally prohibited from most activities in the U.S. and receive no such benefit. This reframes *Mallory* from a tool for the petitioners to a precedent that actually supports the respondents' position.\n    2.  **The Constitutional Threshold Path (\"Not a Person\"):** The respondents counter this potentially dispositive argument on purely procedural grounds. They assert that the petitioners *forfeited* this argument by not raising it in the lower courts, and thus it was not addressed by the Second Circuit and is not properly before the Supreme Court. By labeling this an \"ever-changing theory\" creating \"waiver problems,\" they are providing the Court with a strong procedural reason to ignore this \"off-ramp\" entirely, complicating what previously appeared to be a clean exit for the justices.\n    3.  **The Foreign Policy Deference Path:** The respondents reframe this not as a matter of deference, but as a violation of the separation of powers. They argue that Congress, through the PSJVTA, is attempting to dictate a rule of decision to the courts and redefine the substance of a constitutional right (due process). Citing precedents like *United States v. Klein* and *City of Boerne v. Flores*, they position the statute as a congressional encroachment on the judiciary's exclusive power to interpret the Constitution. This argument pits deference to the political branches directly against the Court's own institutional authority.\n\n*   **New \"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments Introduced:** The BIO introduces a new category of arguments designed to persuade the Court not to hear the case at all, regardless of the merits. These arguments suggest the case is a poor vessel for deciding these major constitutional questions.\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** The respondents claim there is no disagreement among the circuit courts on this issue, as every court to consider the PSJVTA has found it unconstitutional, removing a primary reason for the Supreme Court to grant review.\n    *   **Messy Factual Record:** They highlight case-specific issues that complicate a clean ruling. This includes the *Fuld* plaintiffs obtaining a separate $191 million judgment against Hamas for the same attack on the theory that Hamas was trying to *undermine* the PA, an inconsistent position. They also point to the age of the *Sokolow* case (final judgment was eight years ago), raising finality concerns.\n    *   **Better Cases in the Pipeline:** The brief notes that similar cases are currently pending in the D.C. and Tenth Circuits, suggesting the Court should wait for the law to develop further in the lower courts.\n\n*   **The US Government's Position is Now More Nuanced:** The respondents have strategically highlighted the government's shifting stance by attaching the Solicitor General's 2018 brief from a prior stage of this litigation. In that brief, the U.S. recommended *against* certiorari, stating the petitioners' Fifth Amendment theory was \"not [] well developed.\" This casts the government's current petition for certiorari in a new light, framing it as a change of position that the Court might view with skepticism.\n\n*   **Confirmed and Refined Uncertainty:** While the massive uncertainty regarding the respondents' arguments has been resolved, my uncertainty has now shifted. The critical questions are now: 1) How will the petitioners and the U.S. government, in their merits briefs, rebut the respondents' specific arguments regarding the *Mallory* distinction and the separation of powers? 2) Will the Court be willing to overlook the procedural forfeiture issue to address the \"not a person\" argument? 3) Will the \"poor vehicle\" arguments be persuasive enough for the Court to dismiss the case or affirm the Second Circuit on narrow, case-specific grounds, avoiding the major constitutional questions altogether? The respondents have successfully laid out multiple, non-ideological, procedural paths for the Court to rule in their favor.",

          "task_beliefs": "The new observation is an internal thought process, a meta-reflection on the state of my knowledge after analyzing the Respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO). It does not introduce new external evidence or arguments about the case itself. Instead, it confirms the significance of the BIO analysis and solidifies my current understanding. Therefore, my task beliefs remain stable, as they accurately reflect the most current and comprehensive view of the legal landscape following the introduction of the respondents' arguments.\n\nMy current, confirmed beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Petitioners' Arguments Face Strong, Specific Rebuttals:** The respondents have established direct counterarguments for each of the petitioners' likely paths to victory.\n    1.  **Consent-by-Conduct (Jurisdiction):** The respondents have weakened this path by framing the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act's (PSJVTA) \"deemed consent\" as a \"legal fiction\" that violates due process precedents like *Insurance Corp. of Ireland*. They argue the predicate conduct (payments in Palestine) has no nexus to the U.S. forum. Critically, they distinguish *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* by arguing that unlike a corporation registering to do business, the PLO and PA are prohibited from most U.S. activities and receive no reciprocal benefit, making the consent involuntary and baseless.\n    2.  **\"Not a Person\" (Constitutional Threshold):** The respondents have erected a significant procedural barrier to this argument. They contend the petitioners *forfeited* this theory by not raising it in the lower courts, providing the Supreme Court with a strong procedural basis to avoid ruling on its merits.\n    3.  **Foreign Policy Deference:** The respondents have reframed this as a separation of powers violation. Citing *United States v. Klein*, they argue Congress is unconstitutionally dictating a rule of decision to the judiciary and attempting to redefine the substance of the Due Process Clause, an encroachment on the Court's institutional role.\n\n*   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments Present Procedural Off-Ramps:** The respondents have introduced several case-specific arguments suggesting the Court should not decide the major constitutional questions presented:\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** They assert that all courts of appeals to consider the PSJVTA have found it unconstitutional, removing a primary impetus for Supreme Court review.\n    *   **Factual Complications:** They highlight inconsistencies in the record, such as a separate judgment against Hamas based on the theory that Hamas was *undermining* the PA, and the age of the related *Sokolow* judgment, which raises finality concerns.\n    *   **Alternative Pending Cases:** They suggest the Court could wait for a cleaner case to emerge from other circuits where similar litigation is pending.\n\n*   **The U.S. Government's Position is Complicated:** The respondents have successfully cast doubt on the government's current stance by highlighting a 2018 Solicitor General brief that recommended *against* certiorari and described the petitioners' Fifth Amendment theory as underdeveloped. This frames the government's current support for the PSJVTA as a potentially opportunistic shift.\n\n*   **Uncertainty is Now Focused and Refined:** My uncertainty has shifted from \"what will the respondents argue?\" to \"how will the petitioners rebut these specific arguments?\" The key unresolved questions are:\n    1.  How will the petitioners and the U.S. government, in their merits briefs, counter the respondents' distinction of *Mallory* and the *Klein*-based separation of powers argument?\n    2.  Will the Court be willing to overlook the procedural forfeiture of the \"not a person\" argument to decide a potentially dispositive constitutional question?\n    3.  How persuasive will the \"poor vehicle\" arguments be in providing the justices with non-ideological, procedural paths to affirm the Second Circuit or dismiss the case?\n\nThe observation confirms that the next critical piece of evidence is the merits briefs from the petitioners (both the private citizens and the U.S. Government), which will reveal their strategies for overcoming the robust defense mounted by the respondents.",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \nAmericans, and incentivizing the PLO and PA to end their \nofficial program of financially rewarding terrorism. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless facially invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, based on several errors.  \nFirst, the court began by asserting the \u201cdue process \nanalysis in the personal jurisdiction context is basically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quotation marks omitted). That is \nincorrect. The Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cacting as an in-\nstrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to \ndivest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, \n294 (1980) (emphasis added). The Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not and never has been an instrument of in-\nternational federalism\u2014for there is no such thing. \nSecond, the court of appeals invented a novel test for \njudging consent-to-jurisdiction statutes, requiring such \nstatutes to be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d between the \nforum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant. Pet.\u2009App.\u200924a. Yet \nthis Court recently upheld a state consent-to-jurisdiction \nlaw in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. \n122 (2023), without suggesting that due process requires \nany reciprocal bargain. Instead, the Court emphasized \nthat \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional conse-\nquences to what some might dismiss as mere formalities,\u201d \nand it rejected the defendant\u2019s request to look behind \nthose formalities to determine whether it had \u201creally sub-\nmitted\u201d to jurisdiction. Id. at 144-145 (plurality opinion). \nThird, the court of appeals misapplied its own test by \nholding that that the PLO and PA received no meaningful \n\u201cbenefit\u201d from engaging in conduct while present in the \nUnited States because their conduct was unlawful. As \nJudge Menashi explained in dissenting from denial of  \nrehearing, that conclusion was \u201cperverse\u201d: A visitor who  \nunlawfully \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from the United States \nshould not be rewarded by heightened due process  \nprotection that is unavailable to law-abiding guests. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a-232a. \nIn enacting the PSJVTA, Congress gave the PLO and \nthe PA a choice: Either refrain from paying terrorists for \nmurdering and maiming Americans, and cease all but a \nhandful of U.S. activities, or else submit to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts in ATA actions. They may not have relished \nthat choice, but they made it freely and with full \nknowledge of the consequences. Striking down the statute \nwill significantly curtail the political branches\u2019 ability to \ncombat terrorism and will restrict the power of Congress \n\n6 \n \nin other contexts\u2014a step that would be a sharp departure \nfrom this Court\u2019s traditional deference to the decisions of \nthe political branches in matters of jurisdiction over for-\neign governments, foreign affairs, and national security. \nA. Legal Background \n1. The Anti-Terrorism Act provides a private right of \naction to U.S. nationals and their families to recover for \ndeath and injuries sustained by reason of acts of interna-\ntional terrorism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired \nby a civil suit brought against the PLO for the 1985 mur-\nder of Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American \ncruise-ship passenger who was shot in the face and \nthrown into the open sea by PLO hijackers. \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family was able to hold the PLO ac-\ncountable for the murder only because federal admiralty \njurisdiction happened to be available. H.R. Rep. No. 102-\n1040, at 5 (1992). In advancing the ATA, the Senate Judi-\nciary Committee explained that it would \u201copen[] the \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep.

Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nThe ATA provides for nationwide service of process \nand exclusive federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u20092334(a), \n2338. The Attorney General may intervene in such ac-\ntions, id. \u00a7\u20092336(c), and may obtain a civil forfeiture of \n\u201c[a]ll assets, foreign or domestic, of any individual, entity, \nor organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any \nFederal crime of terrorism against the United States, \n\n7 \n \ncitizens or residents of the United States, or their prop-\nerty,\u201d id. \u00a7\u2009981(a)(1)(G)(i) (cleaned up). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil ATA \ncases based on the organizations\u2019 systematic and continu-\nous presence in the United States. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009193a\u2009n.10 \n(collecting cases). In 2016, however, the court of appeals \nin this case held that U.S. courts could no longer do so be-\ncause this Court had \u201cnarrowed the test for general juris-\ndiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009140-141a. It also held that specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and PA was absent because the \u201cconduct \nthat could have subjected them to liability under the \nATA\u201d occurred \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Id. at 166a. \n2. Congress responded to that decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked another traditional basis for the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any de-\nfendant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates \nfrom maintaining an office or spending money in the \nUnited States\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant \nmaintains \u201cany office \u2026 within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States\u201d after January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the \ndate of the occurrence of the act of international terror-\nism.\u201d Pub.

The House Judiciary \nCommittee explained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to con-\ndition\u201d the PLO and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the \nUnited States on [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Con-\ngress has repeatedly tied their continued receipt of these \nprivileges to their adherence to their commitment to re-\nnounce terrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018). \nThe court of appeals in this case then held that the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates had not been met. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009\n\n8 \n \n10a-11a. In response, Congress again amended the ATA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 308, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e). \nThe PSJVTA has two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the \nlaw\u2019s enactment, the defendant makes any payment \nto a designee of an individual imprisoned for, or \nkilled while, committing a terror attack that killed \nor injured a national of the United States, if the pay-\nment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d such death or impris-\nonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d prong. \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after en-\nactment, the defendant \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization or the Pales-\ntinian Authority.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to \nsix exceptions, including maintaining an office or \nconducting an activity \u201cexclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Na-\ntions.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), (B). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cU.S.-activities\u201d prong. \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \n1. These cases arose out of a series of terror attacks \nin Israel that killed and injured dozens of U.S. nationals. \nAlan Bauer and his seven-year-old son were walking down \na crowded street when a suicide bomber directed by a \nlieutenant in the PA intelligence service blew himself up, \nsending shrapnel through the boy\u2019s brain. The damage \nwas permanent. A bomb tore through Scott Goldberg\u2019s \n\n9 \n \nbody on a city bus while he was on his way to work; he left \na widow and seven children. The suicide bomber was a PA \npolice officer\u2014recruited and directed by a team of other \nPA officers. The PA gave him a hero\u2019s funeral. Four plain-\ntiffs were killed by a massive bomb detonated in a univer-\nsity cafeteria at lunchtime. Their parents learned about \nthe attack while at home in the United States\u2014some by \nrecognizing the bodies or personal effects of their children \non the television news. See Sokolow\u2009C.A.\u2009App.\u20094072-4076, \n4084-4086, 4948-4994, 5288, 5543-5574, 6450, 6454, 6487-\n6489, 6697, 6700, 6852, 7014-7015. \nA terrorist stabbed Ari Fuld, an American citizen and \nfather of four, just hours after Mahmoud Abbas, the \nChairman of the PLO and President of the PA, falsely \nclaimed that the Israeli Government was planning to es-\ntablish Jewish prayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, \none of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. J.A.\u2009420. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial with testimony \nfrom 50 witnesses, the jury found that the PLO and PA, \nacting through their employees, perpetrated the six at-\ntacks at issue and that the PLO and PA knowingly pro-\nvided material support to organizations designated by the \nState Department as foreign terrorist organizations. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009141a. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million \nin damages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA to $655.5 million. Ibid. \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. Ibid. The court rejected \nplaintiffs\u2019 argument that governmental entities like the \nPLO and PA were not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process \nClause, holding that the PLO and PA enjoy due process \nrights precisely because \u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state.\u201d Id. \nat 153a. It also held that the test for personal jurisdiction \n\n10 \n \nis \u201cthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Id. at 156a. Applying Fourteenth Amendment \nstandards, the court of appeals held that U.S. courts could \nnot exercise general jurisdiction because the PLO and PA \nwere \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d id. at 160a, and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States,\u201d id. at 167a. This Court \ndenied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nBipartisan sponsors introduced the ATCA in Con-\ngress a few weeks later. 164 Cong. Rec. S2926 (May 24, \n2018). They explained that \u201crecent Federal court deci-\nsions\u201d had \u201cseverely undermined the ability of American \nvictims to bring terrorists to justice.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. \nS5103-01 (July 19, 2018) (Sen. Grassley); see 164 Cong. \nRec. H6617-18 (July 23, 2018) (Rep. Nadler). The House \nJudiciary Committee explained that the bill\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d \nwas \u201cto better ensure that victims of international terror-\nism can obtain justice in United States courts.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 2 (2018). President Trump signed the bill \ninto law. Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs then moved to recall the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s mandate in light of the ATCA. The court de-\nnied the motion, finding that the ATCA\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009133a. The Sokolow \nplaintiffs again sought this Court\u2019s review. While their pe-\ntition was pending, Congress enacted the PSJVTA. This \nCourt granted the petition, vacated the judgment below, \nand remanded in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020). The Second Circuit in turn remanded to the dis-\ntrict court. \n3. On remand in Sokolow, and on a Rule 12(b)(2) mo-\ntion in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged the PSJVTA on \nthe ground that it facially violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause. The United States intervened in \nboth cases. \n\n11 \n \na. In Sokolow, the district court determined that the \nPLO and PA engaged in conduct meeting the pay-for-slay \nprong, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A), finding that they \u201cmade \npayments after April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals \nkilled while committing acts of terrorism, that the pay-\nments were made because the individuals engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200985a. Ample evidence supported the findings: \nConsistent with their long history of supporting and glo-\nrifying terrorism, the PLO and PA have an official policy \nof rewarding terrorists (or their next of kin) for attacking \nJews. J.A.\u2009156-157. These payments \u201care not social wel-\nfare or charity to the needy.\u201d Ibid. They are provided to \n\u201crich and poor alike,\u201d without regard to financial condi-\ntion. Ibid. They are unavailable to those who commit \u201cor-\ndinary\u201d crimes. Id. at 159. The PLO and PA made pay-\nments for at least 175 Palestinian individuals killed while \nor imprisoned for committing terror attacks that killed or \ninjured Americans. J.A.\u200969-135; Sokolow D. Ct. Doc. 1015-\n1. The payees included perpetrators of the attacks at issue \nin Sokolow. See Sokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc. 1015, at 11. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs asked the district court to \nmake factual findings that the PLO and PA engaged in \nconduct meeting the U.S.-activities prong, by engaging in \n\u201cactivit[ies] while physically present in the United States\u201d \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Plaintiffs offered evidence that, after \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, PLO and PA officials dissem-\ninated public-relations material in the United States urg-\ning supporters to lobby the U.S. Government and public \nin support of their political agenda; gave speeches at U.S. \nuniversities and local venues; and authorized PA-depu-\ntized notaries in the United States to certify documents \nfor use in territories administered by the PA. See J.A.\u2009\n149-152, 275, 282-285, 616-913. The district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \n\n12 \n \nin these types of activities,\u201d but declined to determine \nwhether they fell within any statutory exemption. Pet.\u2009\nApp.\u200973a-75a. \nThe Fuld district court assumed without deciding \nthat both prongs had been satisfied. Id. at 101a-102a & \nn.3. \nb. Both district courts held the law facially unconsti-\ntutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Id. at 74a-77a, 87a-92a, 108a-125a. In their \nview, this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \u201cob-\nsolete\u201d consent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-\nInternational Shoe precedents. Id. at 76a, 112a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Id. at 1a-70a. \na. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in consent-man-\nifesting conduct by paying terrorists who had murdered \nAmericans, and it assumed that they had conducted non-\nexempt activities within the United States. Id. at 38a, 68a \nn.7. The Second Circuit also did not dispute that the \nPSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due process requirements,\u201d by \nproviding fair warning to the defendants and by reasona-\nbly advancing legitimate governmental interests. Id. at \n29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, under the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to jurisdiction must be based on a \u201creciprocal bar-\ngain\u201d with the government or else must derive from \u201cliti-\ngation-related conduct.\u201d Id. at 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as a constitutionally cognizable \u201cbenefit\u201d because \ntheir consent-manifesting conduct was \u201cprohibited\u201d by \nlaw. Id. at 28a. \n\n13 \n \nb. Plaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing \nen banc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. Id. at \n208a. Judge Menashi dissented, joined in full or part by \nChief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and Park. Id. \nat\u2009229a-267a. In Judge Menashi\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he panel\u2019s de-\ncision lacks a basis in the Constitution and cannot be rec-\nonciled with Supreme Court precedent on personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d Id. at 230a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The PSJVTA satisfies Fifth Amendment stand-\nards. \nA. As the Fifth Amendment was understood when \nratified, the guarantee of \u201cdue process of law\u201d did not pro-\nhibit the adjudication of conduct arising outside U.S. ter-\nritory. Cases arising outside the United States were com-\nmon in the Revolutionary Era, and Article III was framed \nby lawyers and judges who had been deeply involved in \nmany such cases. The Constitution expressly permits the \nadjudication of extraterritorial cases, and the Framers \nexplained that congruence between the reach of the legis-\nlative and judicial powers was intentional. The First Con-\ngress authorized extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Judi-\nciary Act of 1789 and the Crimes Act of 1790. \nWhen the Due Process Clause was ratified, no one un-\nderstood it to disturb prior practice. Although scholars \nhave adopted different views about its original meaning, \nno evidence suggests that anyone in 1791 thought the \nClause would limit adjudication of extraterritorial con-\nduct.  \nB.  The PSJVTA also satisfies Fifth Amendment due \nprocess standards under this Court\u2019s precedents. In the \nyears following ratification, the Court repeatedly con-\nfirmed that the judicial power of the United States ex-\ntends to cases involving conduct occurring outside the Na-\ntion\u2019s borders. Jurisdictional limits did exist, but they \n\n14 \n \nwere supplied by the law of nations, which Congress could \noverride by a clear command. \nOver time, this Court came to impose territorial limits \non the States under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. But even as it did so, the Court con-\ntinued to approve adjudication of federal cases arising ex-\ntraterritorially. Because the PSJVTA reflects express \ncongressional authorization to adjudicate disputes under \nU.S. law based on extraterritorial conduct, and because it \nis not arbitrary or fundamentally unfair, it does not run \nafoul of this Court\u2019s precedents applying the Fifth \nAmendment. \nC.  The Second Circuit held that personal jurisdiction \nin civil cases under the Fifth Amendment is governed by \nrules developed under the Fourteenth Amendment. But \nthose rules serve interstate federalism, preventing a \nState from infringing other States\u2019 sovereignty by adjudi-\ncating disputes with little connection to the forum. Such \nconcerns do not apply to the Federal Government. \nThe Second Circuit also erred by imposing a stricter \nstandard for civil cases than for criminal ones. Federal \ncases\u2014whether civil or criminal\u2014should be governed by \na single Fifth Amendment standard. It makes no sense to \nallow federal courts to impose criminal penalties (impris-\nonment or death) but not civil penalties (money damages) \nfor the same extraterritorial conduct. \nII.  Even if Fourteenth Amendment standards ap-\nplied, the PSJVTA would satisfy them. \nA.  In Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023), this Court upheld Pennsylvania\u2019s con-\nsent-to-jurisdiction statute against a Fourteenth Amend-\nment challenge. The Second Circuit attempted to distin-\nguish Mallory on the theory that the defendant there re-\nceived a \u201creciprocal bargain\u201d from Pennsylvania, but the \ndecision did not rest on that ground. Rather, the Court \n\n15 \n \nexplained that accepting an in-state benefit with jurisdic-\ntional strings attached was merely one means of construc-\ntively consenting to personal jurisdiction; another is by \nengaging in conduct specified by law as constituting sub-\nmission to jurisdiction, as happened here. This case fol-\nlows a fortiori from Mallory, because the Federal Gov-\nernment has a vital interest in the adjudication of anti-ter-\nrorism cases involving American victims. In contrast, as \nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court observed, the statute in \nMallory advanced no legitimate state interest. \nB.  The PLO and PA\u2019s consent was knowing and vol-\nuntary, because they had fair warning of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction, which they engaged in \nvolitionally. The PSJVTA also meets the traditional due \nprocess standard of reasonableness within the context of \nour federal system. \nC.  Even if the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d \ntest were valid, it would be satisfied here. The PLO and \nPA have received a \u201cbenefit\u201d from the United States by \nexercising \u201cthe privilege of residing and conducting busi-\nness in the United States\u2014not to mention furthering \ntheir political goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a (Menashi, J., dissenting). Their U.S. activ-\nities include notarizing documents for official use in their \nhome territories, posting on U.S.-based social media plat-\nforms to raise public awareness and bring attention to \ntheir cause, and meeting with local groups to encourage \nthem to lobby Congress to support that cause. \nThe Second Circuit denied the relevance of those U.S. \nactivities on the ground that they were all unlawful. That \nassertion is legally incorrect: The PLO and PA are not le-\ngally barred from conducting any activities in the United \nStates. The court\u2019s reasoning is also illogical: Someone \nwho conducts illegal activities in the forum obviously ex-\ntracts a benefit from the forum. A contrary rule would \n\n16 \n \nperversely give law-breakers due process protections un-\navailable to law-abiding persons. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE PSJVTA SATISFIES FIFTH AMENDMENT STANDARDS \nAt the Founding, the federal Judiciary\u2019s power to ad-\njudicate disputes was understood to be coextensive with \nCongress\u2019s power to legislate\u2014which included matters \narising abroad. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause was not seen as a constraint on congressional \npower over personal jurisdiction at all: \u201cIf Congress \nwanted to exercise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a \nfederal court \u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and \nproceed upon the law.\u2019\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, \n1706 (2020) (quoting Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 615) (Sachs). \nThe decision below, by subjecting Congress to the \nsame jurisdictional limitations that apply to the States, \nimproperly \u201ctakes the Fourteenth Amendment as given, \nand remakes the Fifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at \n1705. Such \u201creverse incorporation\u201d of Fourteenth Amend-\nment standards into the Fifth Amendment is contrary to \nthis Court\u2019s precedents. Although the Court has long re-\nstricted the States\u2019 jurisdiction over disputes arising out-\nside their boundaries, it has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial cases to go forward in the federal courts, ex-\nplaining that such cases lie within Congress\u2019s power to au-\nthorize. Accepting the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning would \nresult in an upside-down regime in which unrecognized \nforeign governments enjoy due process protection una-\nvailable to States of the Union, and defendants in civil \ncases enjoy greater due process protections than defend-\nants in criminal cases arising out of the exact same con-\nduct. \n\n17 \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning \nImposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction \nThe Constitution expressly authorizes adjudication of \ncases arising from extraterritorial conduct. This power \nwas an intentional feature of the constitutional plan, re-\nflecting common practice during the Revolutionary Era, \nincluding in cases tried and adjudicated by the Framers \nthemselves. Ratification of the Due Process Clause did \nnot alter that feature. To the contrary, the most authori-\ntative interpreters of the Bill of Rights\u2014the First Con-\ngress and this Court\u2014continued the pre-constitutional \npractice of permitting adjudication of claims against for-\neign defendants arising from conduct abroad. \n1. Before The Fifth Amendment, Extraterritorial \nCases Were Permitted \nThe Constitution\u2019s text expressly vests Congress and \nthe Judiciary with extraterritorial powers. Most obvi-\nously, Congress may \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Fel-\nonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against \nthe Law of Nations\u201d and \u201cmake Rules concerning Cap-\ntures on Land and Water.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u20098, Cls. 10, \n11. And what Congress can legislate, the Judiciary can ad-\njudicate: \u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in \nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the \nLaws of the United States, and Treaties made \u2026 under \ntheir Authority.\u201d Id. Art. III, \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 1 (emphasis added). \nThe Constitution empowers the Judiciary to adjudicate \ncases arising extraterritorially in other respects, too, in-\ncluding \u201call Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,\u201d \nibid., and \u201call Crimes \u2026 not committed within any State,\u201d \nid. \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 3. \nJudicial power commensurate with extraterritorial \nlegislative power was a deliberate feature of the constitu-\ntional plan. At the Philadelphia Convention, leading dele-\ngates explained that judicial power should be coextensive \n\n18 \n \nwith legislative power. For example, James Madison ex-\nplained that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establishment com-\nmensurate to the legislative authority, was essential.\u201d 1 \nRecords of the Federal Convention 124 (Max Farrand ed., \n1911) (Farrand). James Wilson agreed: \u201cthe Judicial \nshould be commensurate to the legislative and Executive \nAuthority.\u201d Id. at 237 n.18. In The Federalist, Hamilton \nobserved that \u201c[i]f there are such things as political axi-\noms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \namong the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80, at 588 (Ham-\nilton ed. 1864). Madison, Wilson, and other Founders also \nexpressed this view at the ratifying conventions. In Penn-\nsylvania, for instance, Wilson explained that without such \nparity, the Federal Government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Elliott); see 3 Elliot at 532 (Madison); id. at \n517 (Pendelton in Virginia); 4 Elliot at 156-158 (Davie in \nNorth Carolina). \nPermitting adjudication of cases arising from extra-\nterritorial conduct had a strong antecedent in practice. \nCourts in the newly independent United States adjudi-\ncated thousands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases. See \nHenry J. Bourguignon, The First Federal Court: The \nFederal Appellate Prize Court of the American Revolu-\ntion 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977) (Bourguignon). Such cases \ngenerally arose from extraterritorial events. E.g., \nDarby v. Brig Erstern, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 34, 35 (Fed. Ct. \nApp. 1782); Miller v. The Resolution, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 19, \n20-21 (Fed. Ct. App. 1781). Leading delegates arrived at \nthe Philadelphia Convention with extensive experience as \nlawyers and judges in those very cases. See Deirdre Mask \n& Paul MacMahon, The Revolutionary War Prize Cases \nand the Origins of Diversity Jurisdiction, 63 Buff. L. \nRev. 477 (2015); Bourguignon at 328-329; see also Letter \n\n19 \n \nfrom E. Randolph to J. Madison (Apr. 19, 1782), \nbit.ly/40i7aUC; Letter from J. Madison to E. Randolph \n(May 1, 1782), bit.ly/3DWIY2F. \nAfter ratification, the First Congress exercised its au-\nthority to prescribe extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Ju-\ndiciary Act of 1789 granted the federal courts jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. The Crimes \nAct of 1790 similarly authorized prosecution of crimes \ncommitted \u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 9, \u00a7\u00a7\u20098-13, 1 Stat. \n113-115. This Court has \u201coften looked to laws enacted by \n[the First] Congress as evidence of the original under-\nstanding of the meaning of [the Bill of Rights].\u201d Collins v. \nVirginia, 584 U.S. 586, 613 n.3 (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(collecting cases). \nLeading Framers confirmed that extraterritorial ju-\nrisdiction was intended. During deliberations on the Judi-\nciary Act, Madison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted \nand introduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view \nthat the judicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with \nthe other branches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. \n843 (Aug. 29, 1789). And the following year, Edmund Ran-\ndolph prepared a report in which he concluded that the \nfederal courts had the exclusive power \u201cto decide all \ncauses arising wholly on the sea, and not within the pre-\ncincts of any county.\u201d Edmund Randolph, Report from the \nAttorney General on the Judiciary System of the United \nStates (Dec. 31, 1790), reprinted in 1 American State Pa-\npers, Miscellaneous 22 (1834).2 \n \n2 Before serving as the first Attorney General, Randolph was a \nmember of the Committee on Detail at the Philadelphia Convention, \nand the \u201cfirst draft\u201d of the Constitution is in his handwriting. See \nWilliam Ewald, The Committee of Detail, 28 Const. Commentary \n197, 220 (2012). \n\n20 \n \n2. The Fifth Amendment Did Not Change The \nJurisdictional Baseline \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s text and history provide no \nindication that it was understood to change the pre-ratifi-\ncation baseline. Indeed, scholarship confirms that no one \nin 1791 understood the Due Process Clause to restrict the \njudicial power of the United States at all, much less to \nlimit federal jurisdiction to the adjudication of cases aris-\ning within the Nation\u2019s borders. Rather, three principal \nschools of thought have emerged about the meaning of the \nwords \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014and none of them involves \npersonal jurisdiction. \nOne view of the phrase\u2019s original public meaning was \nthat a deprivation of rights had to be judicial, that is, \n\u201cpreceded by certain procedural protections characteris-\ntic of judicial process.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman & Michael W. \nMcConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 \nYale L.J. 1672, 1679 (2012) (Chapman & McConnell); see \nUnited States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U.S. 159, 168 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., concurring); United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1, 36 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This view \ndraws support from early state practice, most promi-\nnently New York\u2019s 1787 statutory bill of rights and an oft-\ncited speech by Alexander Hamilton, both of which refer-\nence \u201cdue process of law.\u201d See Ryan C. Williams, The One \nand Only Substantive Due Process Clause, 120 Yale L.J. \n408, 441-443 (2010) (Williams); see also id. at 437-445; \nChapman & McConnell at 1703-1717. Consistent with this \nview, this Court in Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & \nImprovement Co., 59 U.S. (18. How.) 272 (1856), held that \nCongress may not deprive a person of property except un-\nder \u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding,\u201d which give \nthe defendant the benefit of a judge (\u201cjudex\u201d), as well as \n\u201cregular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial ac-\ncording to some settled course of judicial proceedings.\u201d \nId. at 277, 280. \n\n21 \n \nAn alternative originalist view emphasizes a nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess,\u201d as \u201cwrits or precepts \nduly issued (usually by a court) or arising by operation of \nlaw.\u201d Max Crema & Lawrence B. Solum, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 462 (2022). Proponents of this \nview note that, in Founding-era legal documents, the nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess\u201d was much more com-\nmonly used than the broader (though still procedural) \n\u201ccourse of proceedings\u201d sense, which was more often ex-\npressed as \u201cdue course of law.\u201d Id. at 488-508. They also \nsuggest that the records of the ratifying convention of \nNew York\u2014the only State to include the  phrase \u201cdue pro-\ncess\u201d in its proposed amendments\u2014show an evolution of \nthe proposal from \u201cLaw of the Land\u201d to \u201cDue Course of \nLaw\u201d and then to \u201cDue Process of Law.\u201d Id. at 508 & n.257 \n(citation omitted). \nThis Court\u2019s traditional view of the Due Process \nClause has been that it embodies a \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect \n\u201cintended to secure the individual from the arbitrary ex-\nercise of the powers of government.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, \n510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) (plurality opinion) (quotation \nmarks omitted). This Court has scrutinized federal stat-\nutes under that standard to ensure that they are \u201csup-\nported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by ra-\ntional means.\u201d United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30-\n31 (1994); see Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, \n465 (1991). Under this view, \u201c[t]he party asserting a Fifth \nAmendment due process violation must overcome a pre-\nsumption of constitutionality and establish that the legis-\nlature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d Nat\u2019l \nR.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. \nCo., 470 U.S. 451, 472 (1985) (quotation marks omitted). \nScholars debate whether this view took root in American \nlaw before or after ratification of the Fifth Amendment. \nCompare Crema & Solum at 513-518; Williams at 428-454; \n\n22 \n \nChapman & McConnell at 1676 n.5; with Chapman & \nMcConnell at 1676-1677 n.6. \n3. The PSJVTA Does Not Deprive The PLO And \nPA Of Any Due Process Right Recognized At \nThe Founding \nMeasuring the PSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality against \nthe original public meaning of the Fifth Amendment, this \nis an easy case regardless of which view one accepts. \nNothing in the statute interferes with the PLO and PA\u2019s \nability to defend themselves before a court of law applying \n\u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding.\u201d Denezpi v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 591, 617 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., dis-\nsenting) (quoting Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. (18 How.) at \n277). The statute does not deprive them of the benefit of \nan independent judge, or of \u201cregular allegations, oppor-\ntunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled \ncourse of judicial proceedings.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. \n(18 How.) at 280. And in both Fuld and Sokolow, the PLO \nand PA were served with a writ (i.e., a summons) in the \nUnited States, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(a). See \nSokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20092; Fuld\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20098, 9. \nThis Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents re-\nquire no more. Nothing about the PSJVTA is \u201carbitrary \nand irrational.\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger, 470 U.S. at 472 \n(quotation marks omitted). It reasonably advances vital \ninterests of the United States. It disrupts and deters sup-\nport for terrorism, which is \u201can urgent objective of the \nhighest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 28 (2010). It advances the protection of U.S. citi-\nzens abroad. See Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, \n687 (2019) (\u201cspecial protection [abroad] for U.S. nationals \nserves key national interests\u201d). It promotes the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring \u201cfair compensation for \nAmerican victims of terrorism from those responsible for \ntheir losses.\u201d J.A.\u200968. And it furthers U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives, because the PLO and PA\u2019s pay-for-slay \n\n23 \n \npolicies \u201cthreaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance \nfor a Palestinian state further and further out of reach.\u201d \n163 Cong. Rec. H9650 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. En-\ngel). \nB. This Court Has Never Blocked Congress From \nAuthorizing Personal Jurisdiction Over Conduct \nArising Abroad \nIn the years immediately following ratification of the \nFifth Amendment, this Court confirmed that the judicial \npower of the United States extends to cases involving con-\nduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. Later, even \nas this Court imposed territorial limits on the States un-\nder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment, it repeatedly rejected the imposition of such limita-\ntions on the Federal Government. \n1. Before The Lochner Era, This Court Never \nStruck Down Any Jurisdictional Statute On \nDue Process Grounds \n\u201cFor the first 150 years of the Republic, today\u2019s con-\nventional view of personal jurisdiction wasn\u2019t so conven-\ntional\u2026. Jurisdictional limits have always been with us, \nbut Fifth Amendment limits are a recent innovation.\u201d \nSachs at 1706, 1708. \nOriginally, extraterritorial jurisdiction was governed \nby the law of nations, which included rules for determin-\ning the circumstances under which \u201cone state\u2019s judgments \n[should] be received or rejected in another\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. \nat 1718. In some cases, the law of nations permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction. In Penhallow v. Doane\u2019s Admin-\nistrators, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54 (1795), this Court enforced \nresolutions adopted by the Continental Congress provid-\ning for trials and appeals in cases of the capture of enemy \nships on the high seas. Id. at 80-81 (opinion of Patterson, \nJ.). The power to provide for adjudication in such cases, \nthe Court explained, was an incident of the Nation\u2019s \n\n24 \n \ninherent \u201cexternal sovereignty.\u201d Id. at 91 (opinion of Ire-\ndell, J.). And in Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 133 \n(1795), the Court unanimously affirmed the exercise of ju-\nrisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of an \nincident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.3 Thus, the availability \nof extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinarily followed back-\nground legal principles established under the law of na-\ntions. \nHowever, Congress could override the law of nations \nby a clear command. See Murray v. Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804). Thus Justice \nWashington explained that federal courts had no \u201cgen-\neral\u201d authority \u201cto issue process into another district, ex-\ncept in cases where such authority has been specially be-\nstowed, by some law of the United States.\u201d Ex parte Gra-\nham, 10 F. Cas. at 912 (emphasis added). If it was \u201cthe will \nof congress to vest in the courts of the United States an \nextra-territorial jurisdiction in prize causes, over persons \nand things found in a district other than that from which \nthe process issued,\u201d then the courts would be bound to fol-\nlow Congress\u2019s instruction. Id. at 913; see ibid. (\u201cthe ex-\nercise of jurisdiction over persons not inhabitants of, or \nfound within the district where the suit is brought\u201d pre-\nsents \u201cdifficulties, which, in the opinion of the court, noth-\ning but an act of congress can remove\u201d). \n \n3 Of the seven members of the Court who participated in one or \nboth of these cases, four (Rutledge, Wilson, Blair, and Patterson) \nserved as delegates at the Philadelphia Convention. 1 Farrand 1-2. \nThe other three served in their respective States\u2019 ratifying conven-\ntions. 2 Elliott 178 (Cushing); id.at 206 (Jay); 4 Elliott 1 (Iredell). \n\n25 \n \nUnder federal legislation, exercising jurisdiction in \ncases arising outside of U.S. territory became established \npractice. \u201cThe prosecution and punishment of extraterri-\ntorial crimes, including crimes committed by aliens, was \none of the federal government\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the dec-\nades following ratification, and \u201cthe federal government \nprincipally used two enforcement mechanisms\u2014punish-\nment after criminal trial, and civil forfeiture after a con-\ndemnation by a federal court sitting in admiralty.\u201d Na-\nthan S. Chapman, Due Process Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. \nRev. 377, 409 (2017) (Chapman). \u201cAmericans appeared to \nbelieve that both enforcement mechanisms were con-\nsistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. at 410. Treatises of \nthe era similarly confirm that the federal courts could \nproperly exercise jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on Ameri-\ncan Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, for the \npurpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where a pirat-\nical offence has been committed.\u201d). \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s power \nto create jurisdiction over foreign conduct\u2014even in the \nface of general principles of the law of nations to the con-\ntrary\u2014is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story explained \nthat Congress could enact a law providing that \u201ca subject \nof England, or France, or Russia, having a controversy \nwith one of our own citizens, may be summoned from the \nother end of the globe to obey our process, and submit to \nthe judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F.\u2009Cas. at 613. And though \nsuch a law might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights and \nsovereignty of other nations,\u201d yet \u201c[i]f congress had pre-\nscribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613, 615.  \nThis Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning in Toland v. \nSprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explaining that \u201cpos-\nitive legislation\u201d would be necessary to authorize federal \ncourts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in a foreign \n\n26 \n \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330. And in The Marianna Flora, 24 \nU.S. (11 Wheat.) 1 (1826) (Story, J.), the Court held that \neven though, as a general matter, \u201cforeign ships are not \nto be governed by our municipal regulations,\u201d still Con-\ngress could direct that a ship captured on the high seas be \nbrought to the United States for adjudication \u201cin our \nCourts.\u201d Id. at 18. \u201c[W]hatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthere can be no doubt \nthat Courts of justice are bound to obey and administer \nthem.\u201d Ibid.; see ibid. (\u201c[T]he act of Congress is decisive \non this subject.\u201d).4 \nCongress also had the power to override the law of \nnations with respect to a State\u2019s recognition of \u201cforeign\u201d \n(i.e., out-of-state) judgments. In D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) 165 (1851), this Court noted Congress\u2019s \nauthority to \u201calter[] the rule\u201d regarding when the judg-\nments of one State\u2019s courts must be recognized by those \nof another. Id. at 174-175. There, a 1790 law required the \nStates to afford \u201cfaith and credit\u201d to the judicial proceed-\nings of other States. Ibid.; see Act of May 26, 1790, ch. 11, \n1 Stat. 122, codified as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091738 (2012). \nThe question was whether that law required recognition \nof a judgment even \u201cwhen the defendant had not been \nserved with process or voluntarily made defence,\u201d despite \nthe fact that such a proceeding would violate \u201cthe interna-\ntional law as it existed among the States in 1790.\u201d D\u2019Arcy, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) at 176. The Court ultimately concluded \n \n4 See also United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610, 631 \n(1818) (\u201cThe constitution having conferred on congress the power of \ndefining and punishing piracy, there can be no doubt of the right of \nthe legislature to enact laws punishing pirates, although they may \nbe foreigners, and may have committed no particular offence \nagainst the United States.\u201d); United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 \nWheat.) 153, 158-160 (1820) (broadly construing the constitutional \ngrant to Congress). \n\n27 \n \nthat \u201cCongress did not intend to overthrow the old rule by \nthe enactment,\u201d but the Court did not question\u2014indeed, \nit presumed\u2014that Congress had authority \u201cto declare a \nnew rule.\u201d Ibid. \nIn sum, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwas understood to be proper if it comported with the law \nof nations or if Congress so provided. No case went the \nother way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil War did a single court, \nstate or federal, hold a personal-jurisdiction statute inva-\nlid on due process grounds.\u201d Sachs at 1712; accord Chap-\nman at 442. \n2. After This Court Began Restricting State Power \nUnder The Fourteenth Amendment, It Rejected \nAnalogous Restrictions Under The Fifth \nTerritorial restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction emerged during the Lochner era, when this \nCourt began invoking due process to restrict state author-\nity to adjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in \nother States. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 \nU.S. 394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills \nv. Menefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); see generally \nStephen E. Sachs, Pennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. \n1249, 1252 (2017); Patrick J. Borchers, The Death of the \nConstitutional Law of Personal Jurisdiction: From Pen-\nnoyer to Burnham and Back Again, 24 U.C. Davis L. Rev. \n19, 43-51 (1990). These decisions were grounded in con-\ncerns about the division of power among the States, and \nin particular the impermissibility of \u201cattempt[ing] to ex-\ntend the authority and control of a state beyond its own \nterritory.\u201d Baker, 242 U.S. at 403. \nDuring the same era, however, this Court repeatedly \nreaffirmed that the Fifth Amendment affords \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n28 \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933) (same); Cook v. Tait, \n265 U.S. 47, 55-56 (1924) (same). \u201c[T]he limitations of the \nConstitution are barriers bordering the states and pre-\nventing them from transcending the limits of their author-\nity, and thus destroying the rights of other states,\u201d the \nCourt explained, but such interstate-federalism concerns \nhave no application to the national sovereign. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. at 306.5 \nFollowing its pathmarking decision in International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), this Court \nhas continued to restrict state-court personal jurisdiction \nas \u201ca consequence of territorial limitations on the power \nof the respective States.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 251 (1958). Yet the Court has been careful to make \nclear it was not holding that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment im-\nposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction by a federal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017). Moreover, \nthe Court has consistently expressed an expansive view \nabout the territorial competence of the national govern-\nment: \u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims al-\nleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed,\u201d Abitron \nAustria GmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 \n \n5 In admiralty cases, which raise no interstate-federalism con-\ncerns, the Court continued to apply the longstanding rule that \u201cthe \nbare circumstance of where the cause of action arose [has not] been \ntreated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise dis-\ncretion whether to take jurisdiction.\u201d Canada Malting Co. v. Pat-\nterson S.S., 285 U.S. 413, 422 (1932); Charter Shipping Co. v. \nBowring, Jones & Tidy, 281 U.S. 515, 517 (1930); Panama R.R. Co. \nv. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897); The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355, 358-359 (1885). \n\n29 \n \n(2023), a principle that remains true \u201cregardless of \nwhether the particular statute regulates conduct, affords \nrelief, or merely confers jurisdiction,\u201d RJR Nabisco, Inc. \nv. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nIn sum, this Court has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction where Congress so provides and \nhas consistently declined to extend Fourteenth Amend-\nment limits to the Federal Government. The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within its precedents. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Reasoning Was Unsound \nThe Second Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018due process analy-\nsis\u2019 in the personal jurisdiction context \u2018is basically the \nsame under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments,\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quoting Pet.\u2009App.\u2009156a), and that \n\u201cthe [Fifth Amendment] due process test for asserting ju-\nrisdiction over extraterritorial criminal conduct \u2026 differs \nfrom the test applicable in this civil case,\u201d id. at 175a (em-\nphasis added; citation omitted). The court accordingly re-\nfused to apply to the PSJVTA \u201cthe broader [i.e., less-re-\nstrictive] Fifth Amendment standard used for personal \njurisdiction in criminal cases.\u201d Id. at 49a. \nThat reasoning was doubly unsound. Federal cases \nare not governed by the Fourteenth Amendment stand-\nard, which protects interstate federalism. Instead, federal \ncases\u2014not only criminal cases but also civil cases\u2014are \ngoverned by a single Fifth Amendment standard. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And \nFourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards \nInterstate Federalism \nPrinciples of interstate federalism limit a State\u2019s as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction \u201cto ensure that States with \n\u2018little legitimate interest\u2019 in a suit do not encroach on \nStates more affected by the controversy.\u201d Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 (2021) \n(quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263). Thus, in \n\n30 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, the Court explained that such \nrestrictions \u201censure that the States, through their courts, \ndo not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by \ntheir status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system\u201d and \nheld that \u201cthe Due Process Clause, acting as an instru-\nment of interstate federalism, may \u2026 divest the State of \nits power to render a valid judgment.\u201d 444 U.S. at 292, 294. \nThe Court has emphasized that allowing a State to assert \njurisdiction \u201cin an inappropriate case \u2026 would upset the \nfederal balance, which posits that each State has a sover-\neignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other \nStates.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). And the Court has re-\niterated that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State implies a \nlimitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d and \ninsofar as personal jurisdiction is concerned, \u201cthis feder-\nalism interest may be decisive.\u201d Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. \nat 263 (cleaned up). \nThis case is different. It concerns federal claims re-\ngarding attacks on American nationals that must be adju-\ndicated in federal court under federal law. Congress cre-\nated these claims to further federal interests in national \nsecurity and foreign affairs. The Constitution allocates \npower over such matters exclusively to the national gov-\nernment. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 \n(2012). \u201cPower over external affairs is not shared by the \nStates,\u201d but instead \u201cis vested in the national government \nexclusively.\u201d United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 233 \n(1942); see Wendy Perdue, Aliens, the Internet, and \n\u201cPurposeful Availment,\u201d: A Reassessment of Fifth \nAmendment Limits On Personal Jurisdiction, 98 Nw. U. \nL. Rev. 455, 461 (2004) (\u201cStates are situated within the \nUnited States quite differently than is the United States \nwithin the international community.\u201d). \nWhereas federalism limitations on the individual \nStates inhere in the \u201cconstitutional plan,\u201d a \u201cforeign State \n\n31 \n \nlies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d Principality of \nMonaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934). The Con-\nstitution limits each State\u2019s extraterritorial regulatory \npowers because they necessarily conflict with the regula-\ntory interests of other States. See Healy v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989). In contrast, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991); see Gamble, 587 U.S. at \n687 (\u201c[M]urder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred.\u201d). \nThe foreign-relations context here highlights the im-\nprudence of imposing interstate-federalism limitations on \nCongress. Congress\u2019s judgments in the foreign-relations \ncontext merit \u201cspecial respect\u201d because they involve \u201ca \nbalance that it is the prerogative of the political branches \nto make.\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 273 \n(2018). \u201cCongress has the undisputed power to decide, as \na matter of federal law, whether and under what circum-\nstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States,\u201d Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U.S. 480, 493 (1983), and the Court should be re-\nluctant to strip Congress of that power when it comes to \nnon-sovereign governments. The PLO and PA are foreign \npolitical entities that aspire to international statehood; as \nsuch, their amenability to suit in federal court should lie \nsolely in the hands of the political branches, not the Judi-\nciary. As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the \nPLO purports to be an independent sovereign entity, we \nhave little difficulty concluding that it falls into [the] cate-\ngory\u201d of entities that \u201cexist outside the constitutional \ncompact and have no rights or responsibilities under it.\u201d \nConstitutionality of Closing the Palestine Information \nOffice, an Affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 105 (1987). \n\n32 \n \nThe Second Circuit got this backwards, holding that \nthe PLO and PA have due process rights because they are \nnot \u201crecognized by the United States as a sovereign \nstate.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200994a, 153a. According to the court, allow-\ning the political branches to subject the PLO and PA to \nsuit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d Id. at 30a \nn.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was wrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nId. at 238a (citation omitted). \n2. The Second Circuit Incorrectly Applied A \nStricter Standard To Civil Cases Than To \nCriminal Cases \nThe Second Circuit acknowledged that the PSJVTA \nsatisfies \u201cbasic principles of due process.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200930a. \nIt also acknowledged that, in the context of criminal pros-\necutions against foreign defendants, the Fifth Amend-\nment permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant \nwho harms American nationals or interests abroad. See \nUnited States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. \n2016).6 The court nevertheless held that, in the context of \na civil dispute, Congress must do more than merely sat-\nisfy these \u201cminimum due process requirements.\u201d \n \n6 Every Circuit to have considered the issue agrees. See United \nStates v. Murillo, 826 F.3d 152, 156-157 (4th Cir. 2016); United \nStates v. Rafoi, 60 F.4th 982, 995 (5th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nIossifov, 45 F.4th 899, 914 (6th Cir. 2022); United States v. Perlaza, \n439 F.3d 1149, 1162 (9th Cir. 2006). \n\n33 \n \nPet.\u2009App.\u200930a. The Second Circuit\u2019s position is thus that \nthe United States may imprison or impose the death pen-\nalty on a foreign person for extraterritorial conduct, but it \ncrosses a red line for the United States to allow a civil \nclaim for money damages against the same person for the \nsame conduct. \nThat makes no sense. As Judge Elrod put it in a case \nconcerning the same issue: \u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold \nthat allowing a civil lawsuit against a foreign defendant \nfor foreign conduct violates due process but that a crimi-\nnal prosecution against the same defendant for the same \nforeign conduct does not.\u201d Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Ka-\nbushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 270 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(dissenting). \nOutside the context of personal jurisdiction, this \nCourt has sometimes required a stricter due process \nstandard in criminal cases than in civil cases. See, e.g., \nTurner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Addington v. \nTexas, 441 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has never sug-\ngested that the inverse should be true: that a stricter \nstandard applies in civil cases than in criminal cases. It \nwould be incongruous to make it harder to deprive a de-\nfendant of property in a civil case than to deprive a de-\nfendant of liberty (or even life) in a criminal case arising \nout of the same facts. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment\u2014\nwhich contains only a single Due Process Clause, applica-\nble to civil and criminal cases alike\u2014supports such a rule. \nII. THE \nPSJVTA \nWOULD \nSATISFY \nFOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT STANDARDS \nEven if the Court were to import Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases into the Fifth Amendment, the \nPSJVTA easily satisfies those standards. That conclusion \nfollows a fortiori from Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Rail-\nway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), which upheld a State\u2019s \n\n34 \n \nauthority to deem registration to do business in the state \nas signifying consent to be sued there. The United States \nmay likewise deem the PLO and PA\u2019s payments to terror-\nists who murdered or maimed U.S. nationals and U.S. ac-\ntivities as signifying their consent to suit in federal anti-\nterrorism cases involving U.S. victims. \nLike the statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA provided \nthe PLO and PA with advance notice of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction in United States courts. \nMoreover, the PSJVTA unquestionably serves legitimate \ngovernmental interests\u2014which the statute in Mallory did \nnot.  \nEven if this Court were to adopt the Second Circuit\u2019s \nnew rule that consent to suit must be part of a \u201creciprocal \nbargain\u201d in order to be valid, the PSJVTA would pass that \ntest too: The PLO and PA obtain valuable benefits from \nengaging in activities within the United States. \nA. This Is A Stronger Case For Jurisdiction Than \nMallory \nFor more than a century and a half\u2014and as recently \nas two Terms ago\u2014this Court has consistently held that \na State has the right to deem specified conduct as consti-\ntuting consent to personal jurisdiction, including by treat-\ning presence as consent to be sued there. The United \nStates, as the national sovereign, is at least equally enti-\ntled to treat specified conduct, including entry into its ter-\nritory, as consent to suit on federal claims in federal \ncourts. \n1. \u201cBoth at the time of the founding and the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the Anglo-American legal \ntradition recognized that a tribunal\u2019s competence was \ngenerally constrained only by the \u2018territorial limits\u2019 of the \nsovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plu-\nrality opinion) (quoting Joseph Story, Commentaries on \nthe Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u2009539, pp. 450-451 (1834)). As a result, \n\n35 \n \n\u201can in personam suit \u2026 could be maintained by anyone on \nany claim in any place \u2026 \u2018wherever the [defendant] may \nbe found.\u2019\u201d Id. at 128-129 (quoting Massie v. Watts, 10 \nU.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 158 (1810)). Even a defendant\u2019s tran-\nsitory presence within the jurisdiction sufficed upon ser-\nvice of process there. See Burnham v. Superior Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990). \n\u201cAs the use of the corporate form proliferated in the \n19th century, the question arose how to adapt the tradi-\ntional rule about transitory actions for individuals to arti-\nficial persons created by law.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 129. \nIn many States, the answer was to treat an artificial en-\ntity\u2019s presence within the State as constructive consent to \nbe sued there. Id. at 129-130. While many of those statutes \nlimited such consent to suits \u201cby in-state plaintiffs,\u201d oth-\ners required foreign entities \u201cto defend themselves there \nagainst any manner of suit.\u201d Id. at 130. \nThis Court consistently upheld such statutes against \ndue process challenges. In St. Clair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350 \n(1882), for instance, the Court upheld a Michigan statute \nthat implied consent to service of process\u2014and thus to \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014\u201cas a condition upon which a for-\neign corporation shall be permitted to do business within \nher limits.\u201d Id. at 356. So long as the state\u2019s jurisdictional \ninterest was \u201creasonable\u201d and the defendant had actual \n\u201cnotice of [the] suit,\u201d due process imposed no barrier. \nIbid. And in Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Is-\nsue Mining Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), the Court held that \nMissouri, by construing its consent-to-jurisdiction statute \nas permitting general jurisdiction upon the (required) ap-\npointment of the superintendent of insurance to receive \nprocess, \u201cdid not deprive the defendant of due process of \nlaw even if it took the defendant by surprise.\u201d Id. at 95. \n2. This Court recently confirmed the continuing vital-\nity of consent-to-jurisdiction statutes in Mallory. There, a \nVirginia-headquartered railroad corporation registered \n\n36 \n \nwith the Pennsylvania Department of State as a condition \nof doing business within the State. See 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. \n\u00a7\u2009411(a). Under a separate statute, such \u201cqualification as \na foreign corporation\u201d was deemed consent to appear in \nthe courts of the State on \u201cany cause of action.\u201d \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i), (b). Based on such \ndeemed consent, a former employee sued the railroad in \nPennsylvania for injuries stemming from activities in Vir-\nginia and Ohio. \nThis Court held that the railroad\u2019s consent was a valid \nbasis for suit under the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing \nfor a four-Justice plurality, Justice Gorsuch explained \nthat the railroad had \u201cagreed to be found in Pennsylvania \nand answer any suit there,\u201d even if its contacts with the \nState did not support general or specific jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 135. Such consent was sufficient, he explained, be-\ncause \u201cpersonal jurisdiction is a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.\u201d Id. at 144. And waiver may \noccur by operation of law, just as readily as by any express \nstatement: Business-registration statutes are among the \n\u201c\u2018variety of legal arrangements [that] have been taken to \nrepresent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process.\u201d Id. at 136 n.5 (quoting \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-704 (1982)) (cleaned up). \nJustice Alito agreed on this point to form a majority. \n\u201cConsent is a separate basis for personal jurisdiction,\u201d he \nexplained, and the railroad \u201chad clear notice that Penn-\nsylvania considered its registration as consent to general \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 153. Justice Alito nevertheless ex-\npressed doubt that \u201cthe Constitution permits a State to \nimpose such a submission-to-jurisdiction requirement.\u201d \nId. at 150. That kind of state law, he explained, creates \nserious tensions with \u201cthe very nature of the federal sys-\ntem that the Constitution created and in numerous provi-\nsions that bear on States\u2019 interactions with one another.\u201d \n\n37 \n \nId. at 154. However, Justice Alito concluded that limits \nimposed by interstate federalism would be better seated \nsomewhere other than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause. Id. at 150. \nMallory controls here. Like the Pennsylvania statute \nat issue there, the PSJVTA clearly specifies in advance, \nand gives fair warning of, the conduct by which \u201ca defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1).  \nIndeed, in important respects, this is a far easier case \nthan Mallory. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \nheld that the State had \u201cno legitimate interest in a contro-\nversy with no connection to the Commonwealth that was \nfiled by a non-resident against a foreign corporation that \nis not at home here.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 266 \nA.3d 542, 567 (Pa. 2021). Here, by contrast, the PSJVTA \napplies only to cases involving terrorism against Ameri-\ncan victims and their families, a topic of preeminent fed-\neral concern. Moreover, unlike Pennsylvania\u2019s business-\nregistration statute, which required a foreign corporation \nto submit to general jurisdiction\u2014including in suits under \nnon-Pennsylvania causes of action\u2014the PSJVTA applies \nonly to a single category of federal cases. And whereas \nPennsylvania\u2019s practical and legal right to exclude from \nthe State a railroad engaged in interstate commerce was \nsuspect, the United States undoubtedly has authority to \nexclude the PLO and PA from its territory. \n3. The Second Circuit read Mallory as being limited \nto circumstances where the defendant \u201caccepted a gov-\nernment benefit from the forum, in return for which the \ndefendant [was] required to submit itself to suit in the fo-\nrum.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200923a-24a. According to the court, consent-\n\n38 \n \nto-jurisdiction statutes must be based on \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d to pass constitutional muster. Id. at 24a.7 \nThis reciprocal-bargains theory was novel. As Judge \nMenashi explained, the Second Circuit simply \u201cinvented a \nnew requirement that applies when Congress or a state \nlegislature attempts to extend personal jurisdiction \nthrough a deemed-consent statute.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009240a-241a \nn.11. \u201cAlthough there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s \nreceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent,\u201d there \ndoes not appear to be \u201cany case holding that such receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Id. at 123a n.10 \n(Furman, J.) (citations omitted; emphasis added). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 reciprocal-bargain test reflects \na basic logic error. While \u201caccepting an in-state benefit \nwith jurisdictional strings attached\u201d is one way for a state \nto provide for consent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion), it is not the only way. \nTo the contrary, even a \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone \nstep\u201d across an \u201cinvisible state line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional consequences [that] are immediate and serious.\u201d \nIbid. Or as Justice Jackson explained, a defendant may \nconsent to jurisdiction \u201cmore than one way,\u201d including: \n(1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly consenting,\u201d by engaging in \nconduct deemed consent under law; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to fol-\nlow specific procedural rules\u201d; or (3) by \u201cvoluntarily in-\nvoking certain benefits from a State that are conditioned \non submitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. \nThe Second Circuit simply erased the first category. As \nJustice Jackson summarized: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction \nrights \nexpressly \nor \n \n7 The court carved out an exception from its government-benefit \nrule for \u201clitigation-related activities,\u201d id. at 22a-24a, but did not ex-\nplain why such activities are sufficient without \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains.\u201d \n\n39 \n \nconstructively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. \nof Ireland is the same: When a defendant chooses to \nengage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-705) (brack-\nets in original). \nThe Second Circuit rested its holding on the rationale \nthat the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d deemed to manifest consent \nto jurisdiction under the PSJVTA is not a sufficiently \nclose \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200938a (emphasis \nadded). That echoes the railroad\u2019s argument in Mallory: \nIt asserted that the statue was a \u201ccoercive assertion of ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d such that its consent was not \u201ctrue consent.\u201d \nResp.\u2009Br. at 3, 7, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 600 U.S. 122 (2023) (No. 21-1168). The railroad thus \nargued it had \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 144 (plurality opinion). \nThis Court rejected the argument. \u201c[A] legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n704-705) (citation omitted). Justice Alito agreed: There \nwas no due process violation because the defendant \u201cacted \nwith knowledge of state law when it registered,\u201d such that \nthe Court may \u201cpresume that by registering, it consented \nto all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 \n(cleaned up). \n\n40 \n \nB. The PSJVTA Also Satisfies Traditional Due \nProcess Standards \nThis Court\u2019s rules for personal jurisdiction require \nthat the defendant receive \u201cfair warning\u201d and that \nmaintenance of the suit must be \u201creasonable, in the con-\ntext of our federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, \n592 U.S. at 358 (citations omitted). The PSJVTA easily \nsatisfies both requirements. \n1. The requirement of \u201cfair warning\u201d ensures that \n\u201c[a] defendant can \u2026 structure its primary conduct to \nlessen or avoid exposure to a given State\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at \n360 (cleaned up). In the context of implied consent, that \nmeans the conduct that will subject the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685 \n(2015). Here, the PLO and PA knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to federal jurisdiction under the PSJVTA. \nTheir consent was knowing because the PSJVTA de-\nscribes, in advance, exactly what actions would be deemed \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in civil cases under the \nATA. Indeed, the PLO and PA received actual notice of \nthe PSJVTA: Before the law took effect, they represented \nto the D.C. Circuit that they \u201cmight never make covered \npayments.\u201d Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., 955 \nF.3d 1016, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2020). Thus, when they later \nmade pay-for-slay payments, they did so knowing that it \nwould vest U.S. courts with jurisdiction over them. \nTheir conduct was also voluntary. Actions are \u201cvol-\nuntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\u201d if \nthey are the product of \u201ca free and unconstrained will.\u201d \nOregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304 (1985) (citation omit-\nted). Conduct is \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d by contrast, only if it arises \nfrom \u201ccoercive activity of the State.\u201d Colorado v. Con-\nnelly, 479 U.S. 157, 165 (1986). \n\n41 \n \nThe PSJVTA gave the PLO and PA a clear and vol-\nuntary choice: either cease engaging in the conduct spec-\nified in the law, or submit to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. That was not coercion. In North Carolina v. Al-\nford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), a criminal defendant argued that \nhis guilty plea to a murder charge was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in \nthe sense required by the Due Process Clause, because \nthe evidence against him presented a serious risk that the \nState would put him to death if he went to trial. Id. at 27-\n28. This Court rejected his claim, holding that even the \nhigh risk of a death sentence did not make the defendant\u2019s \nplea a product of \u201cfear and coercion.\u201d Id. at 29, 37. If \nHenry Alford\u2019s plea was voluntary, so were the PLO and \nPA\u2019s decisions to pay terrorists and their families for mur-\ndering Americans and to engage in non-U.N. activities \nwithin the United States. Cf. Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 \nU.S. 212, 219 n.8 (1978) (\u201cthe legal system is replete with \nsituations requiring the making of difficult judgments as \nto which course to follow,\u201d but that does not make those \nchoices involuntary) (cleaned up). \nThe Second Circuit questioned whether constructive \nwaivers of constitutional rights are ever truly \u201cvoluntary.\u201d \nSee Pet.\u2009App.\u200939a-43a. Relying on dicta from College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999), the court stated that \nconstitutional rights cannot be waived by constructive \nconsent, and that a person\u2019s \u201cability to \u2018abandon\u2019 the rele-\nvant predicate conduct \u2018has no bearing upon the voluntar-\niness of the asserted waiver.\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200940a (quoting 527 \nU.S. at 684) (brackets omitted). That reading of College \nSavings is mistaken. \nIn College Savings, the question was whether a State, \nby engaging in trademark-related activities regulated by \nthe Lanham Act, could be deemed as having implicitly \nwaived its immunity from suit under that Act. 527 U.S. at \n669. The Court held that it could not, and that Congress \n\n42 \n \ndid not have authority \u201cto exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners.\u201d Id. at 683. The Court stated in dicta that constructive \nwaivers are \u201csimply unheard of in the context of other con-\nstitutionally protected privileges,\u201d id. at 681, and that \nCongress\u2019s clear notice of the conduct giving rise to con-\nstructive consent could \u201chave no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver\u201d of State sovereign immunity, id. at \n684. \nThe dicta in College Savings is uninstructive here. \nSovereign immunity and personal jurisdiction differ in \nrelevant ways. A State\u2019s immunity is a fundamental as-\npect of the sovereignty that the States enjoyed before the \nratification of the Constitution; as such, it goes to the very \nheart of our federal system. Personal jurisdiction, by con-\ntrast, is a matter of \u201cindividual liberty\u201d that can \u201cbe \nwaived\u201d through \u201cexpress or implied consent.\u201d Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 702-703. And this Court has specifically re-\njected the argument that \u201cthere is something unique \nabout the requirement of personal jurisdiction, which pre-\nvents it from being established or waived like other \nrights.\u201d Id. at 706; accord Mallory, 600 U.S. at 149 (Jack-\nson, J., concurring).8 \n2. The PSJVTA is also \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. \nat 358 (citation omitted). Making this assessment requires \n\u201ca forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion).  \n \n8 This Court has upheld constructive waivers of constitutional \nrights by statute in other contexts as well. See, e.g., Birchfield v. \nNorth Dakota, 579 U.S. 438 (2016) (Fourth Amendment); South Da-\nkota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) (Fifth Amendment); Bank of Co-\nlumbia v. Okely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235 (1819) (Seventh Amend-\nment). \n\n43 \n \nIn Ford Motor, this Court found that \u201cprinciples of \n\u2018interstate federalism\u2019 support[ed jurisdiction\u201d in the \nplaintiffs\u2019 home states, which had \u201csignificant interests at \nstake\u201d in \u201cproviding their residents with a convenient fo-\nrum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state ac-\ntors, as well as enforcing their own safety regulations.\u201d \n592 U.S. at 368 (cleaned up). Here, the \u201cinterests at stake\u201d \nare those of the national sovereign. As discussed above, \nthe PSJVTA advances national security and foreign policy \ninterests distinct to the United States. See pp. 22-23, 30-\n31, supra. The United States is the only forum where \nAmerican victims of international terrorism (and their \nfamilies) can obtain redress under the ATA. And adjudi-\ncation of such suits does not encroach on the sovereignty \nof another body in our constitutional system. \nC. \nEven If A Reciprocal Benefit Was Required, The \nPLO and PA Received One \nEven if receipt of some \u201cbenefit\u201d was required, the \nPLO and PA have received one: They have obtained \u201cthe \nprivilege of residing and conducting business in the \nUnited States\u2014not to mention furthering their political \ngoals at the expense of American lives.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009231a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting). \nAs an initial matter, the United States has the abso-\nlute power to exclude the PLO and PA from its territory\u2014\nas it did for many years. J.A.\u2009276-279.9 The power to ex-\nclude includes the lesser power to admit on condition of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction. See Washington ex rel. \nBond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Ct. of Wash., 289 \nU.S. 361, 364-365 (1933) (\u201cqualification of a foreign corpo-\nration in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry \n \n9 The United States could exclude the PLO and PA even if doing \nso would violate our treaty obligations to the United Nations. \nUnited States v. Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. Supp. 1456, 1463-\n1465, 1468-1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \n\n44 \n \ninto the state constitutes an assent on its part to all the \nreasonable conditions imposed,\u201d including consent to ju-\nrisdiction); Hess v. Pawlowski, 274 U.S. 352, 356 (1927) \n(similar); St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356 (similar); Baltimore & \nOhio R.R. Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65, 81 (1871) \n(similar). \nThe PLO and PA have benefitted from their presence \nin the United States, including by engaging in activities \nother than those \u201cundertaken exclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations.\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(B). It is uncontested that after the \nstatutory trigger date, their U.S.-based officers, employ-\nees, and agents met with U.S.-based groups to encourage \nthem to \u201clobby[] the government, lobby[] Congress\u201d to \nsupport \u201cjustice for the Palestinian people\u201d; used U.S.-\nbased social media platforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d \nand \u201cbring attention\u201d to their cause; and notarized docu-\nments in the United States for use in Palestinian territo-\nries. J.A.\u2009282-288. In Sokolow, the district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \nin these types of activities.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200973a.10 Their ability \nto engage in these activities while physically present in \nthe United States was a meaningful benefit. Cf. Burnham, \n495 U.S. at 637 (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant re-\nceived \u201csignificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for \nthree days). \nThe Second Circuit dismissed all of these U.S. activi-\nties as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfederal law has \nlong prohibited [the PLO and PA] from engaging in any \n \n10 Opposing certiorari, the PLO and PA contended that petitioners \nforfeited the argument that their U.S. activities meet the PSJVTA\u2019s \nterms. Br.\u2009in\u2009Opp.\u200917-18. That is false. Petitioners told the court of \nappeals that \u201cremands would be required [to consider the U.S.-ac-\ntivities prong] if this Court adopts Defendants\u2019 unprecedented \u2018ben-\nefit\u2019 theory.\u201d Fuld\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A.\u2009Br.\u20096; Sokolow\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A. \nBr.\u20096. \n\n45 \n \nactivities or maintaining any offices in the United States.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200928a. As a result, the court concluded, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d Id. at 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was incorrect that all the \nPLO and PA\u2019s activities in the United States were prohib-\nited by federal law. The relevant statute merely forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates (other than their U.N. mission). 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; \nsee Application of Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 to Diplo-\nmatic Visit of Palestinian Delegation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __, \nat 2 (slip op. Oct. 28, 2022). Their non-expenditure activi-\nties\u2014including notarizing documents, holding meetings \nwith community groups, public speaking, publishing, and \nissuing political statements on social-media\u2014are not for-\nbidden by \u00a7\u20095202.11 \nAs a logical matter, the court was incorrect that if all \ntheir activities had been unlawful, the PLO and PA would \nhave received no benefit from conducting activities within \nthe United States. The legality or illegality of their activi-\nties has no bearing on the question whether they benefited \nfrom the society, economy, and governmental protection \nof the United States. Indeed, if Congress were to prohibit \nthem from engaging in any U.S. activities, and if they \nwere to flout that law, that would only make the PSJVTA \nmore reasonable, not less. As Judge Menashi explained, \n\u201ca foreign actor that conducts unauthorized business in \nthe United States has obtained an even greater benefit \nfrom the forum than the foreign actor that complies with \nAmerican law,\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009250a, and it would be \u201cperverse\u201d \n \n11 The court also cited (Pet.\u2009App.\u200928a\u2009n.9) Section 7(b) of the Pales-\ntinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446. But that \nstatute is inapplicable at this time, because no ministry, agency, or \ninstrumentality of the PA is controlled by Hamas. See ibid. (incor-\nporating 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378b). \n\n46 \n \nto give the law-breaker protection that a law-abiding for-\neigner lacks, id. at 231a. \nTo see this point, consider an analogous consent stat-\nute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent laws \nthat require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor \nvehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol con-\ntent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on \nsuspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d test, these implied-consent \nstatues would be constitutional only as applied to validly \nlicensed drivers who exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege \nof driving on state roads.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200937a\u2009n.14 (citation \nomitted). They would be unconstitutional as applied to \nmotorists whose licenses have been suspended or revoked \nbecause such persons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driv-\ning under existing law. No principle of due process im-\nposes such irrational limits on the political branches. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed. \n\n47 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW  \nFIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \nBRIAN M.

Findings; determinations \n(a) Findings \nThe Congress finds that\u2014 \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter \nin this chapter referred to as the \u201cPLO\u201d) was directly re-\nsponsible for the murder of an American citizen on the \nAchille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the \nPLO\u2019s Executive Committee is under indictment in the \nUnited States for the murder of that American citizen; \n(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the \nmurder of a United States Ambassador overseas; \n(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken \ncredit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens \nof American citizens abroad; *\u2009*\u2009* \n(b) Determinations \nTherefore, the Congress determines that the PLO \nand its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat \nto the interests of the United States, its allies, and to in-\nternational law and should not benefit from operating in \nthe United States. \n\u00a7\u20091003.

Definitions \nAs used in this chapter\u2014 \n(1) the term \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d means activi-\nties that\u2014 \n(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human \nlife that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \nStates or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation \nif committed within the jurisdiction of the United States \nor of any State; \n\n3a \n \n \n(B) appear to be intended\u2014 \n(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; \n(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimi-\ndation or coercion; or \n(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass de-\nstruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and \n(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction \nof the United States, or transcend national boundaries in \nterms of the means by which they are accomplished, the \npersons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or \nthe locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asy-\nlum; *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092333. Civil Remedies \n(a) ACTION AND JURISDICTION.\u2014Any national of the \nUnited States injured in his or her person, property, or \nbusiness by reason of an act of international terrorism, or \nhis or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in \nany appropriate district court of the United States and \nshall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and \nthe cost of the suit, including attorney\u2019s fees. *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092334. Jurisdiction and Venue  \n(a) GENERAL VENUE.\u2014Any civil action under section \n2333 of this title against any person may be instituted in \nthe district court of the United States for any district \nwhere any plaintiff resides or where any defendant re-\nsides or is served, or has an agent.

          "task_beliefs": "The new observation is an internal thought process, a meta-reflection on the state of my knowledge after analyzing the Respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO). It does not introduce new external evidence or arguments about the case itself. Instead, it confirms the significance of the BIO analysis and solidifies my current understanding. Therefore, my task beliefs remain stable, as they accurately reflect the most current and comprehensive view of the legal landscape following the introduction of the respondents' arguments.\n\nMy current, confirmed beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Petitioners' Arguments Face Strong, Specific Rebuttals:** The respondents have established direct counterarguments for each of the petitioners' likely paths to victory.\n    1.  **Consent-by-Conduct (Jurisdiction):** The respondents have weakened this path by framing the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act's (PSJVTA) \"deemed consent\" as a \"legal fiction\" that violates due process precedents like *Insurance Corp. of Ireland*. They argue the predicate conduct (payments in Palestine) has no nexus to the U.S. forum. Critically, they distinguish *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* by arguing that unlike a corporation registering to do business, the PLO and PA are prohibited from most U.S. activities and receive no reciprocal benefit, making the consent involuntary and baseless.\n    2.  **\"Not a Person\" (Constitutional Threshold):** The respondents have erected a significant procedural barrier to this argument. They contend the petitioners *forfeited* this theory by not raising it in the lower courts, providing the Supreme Court with a strong procedural basis to avoid ruling on its merits.\n    3.  **Foreign Policy Deference:** The respondents have reframed this as a separation of powers violation. Citing *United States v. Klein*, they argue Congress is unconstitutionally dictating a rule of decision to the judiciary and attempting to redefine the substance of the Due Process Clause, an encroachment on the Court's institutional role.\n\n*   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments Present Procedural Off-Ramps:** The respondents have introduced several case-specific arguments suggesting the Court should not decide the major constitutional questions presented:\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** They assert that all courts of appeals to consider the PSJVTA have found it unconstitutional, removing a primary impetus for Supreme Court review.\n    *   **Factual Complications:** They highlight inconsistencies in the record, such as a separate judgment against Hamas based on the theory that Hamas was *undermining* the PA, and the age of the related *Sokolow* judgment, which raises finality concerns.\n    *   **Alternative Pending Cases:** They suggest the Court could wait for a cleaner case to emerge from other circuits where similar litigation is pending.\n\n*   **The U.S. Government's Position is Complicated:** The respondents have successfully cast doubt on the government's current stance by highlighting a 2018 Solicitor General brief that recommended *against* certiorari and described the petitioners' Fifth Amendment theory as underdeveloped. This frames the government's current support for the PSJVTA as a potentially opportunistic shift.\n\n*   **Uncertainty is Now Focused and Refined:** My uncertainty has shifted from \"what will the respondents argue?\" to \"how will the petitioners rebut these specific arguments?\" The key unresolved questions are:\n    1.  How will the petitioners and the U.S. government, in their merits briefs, counter the respondents' distinction of *Mallory* and the *Klein*-based separation of powers argument?\n    2.  Will the Court be willing to overlook the procedural forfeiture of the \"not a person\" argument to decide a potentially dispositive constitutional question?\n    3.  How persuasive will the \"poor vehicle\" arguments be in providing the justices with non-ideological, procedural paths to affirm the Second Circuit or dismiss the case?\n\nThe observation confirms that the next critical piece of evidence is the merits briefs from the petitioners (both the private citizens and the U.S. Government), which will reveal their strategies for overcoming the robust defense mounted by the respondents.",

Observing this will cause a maximal update to my belief model for this specific case, making the Task EIG extremely high. The Design EIG is also very high because understanding the strategic choices of the Solicitor General in a high-stakes separation-of-powers case provides crucial, generalizable data for modeling the Court's interaction with the Executive Branch.

This \nCourt can decide this case by applying that Fourteenth \nAmendment standard to the Act of Congress at issue \nhere.  But in addition, the Constitution, including the \nFifth Amendment, at a minimum affords Congress \nbroader power and greater flexibility to provide for the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts, par-\n\n2 \n \nticularly in contexts implicating foreign affairs and na-\ntional security.   \nCongress passed and the President signed the Pro-\nmoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (Act), Pub. L. No. 116-94, Div. J, Tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, in accordance with those constitu-\ntional principles, to further the Nation\u2019s foreign policy, \nprotect national security, and provide a means to seek \ncompensation for U.S. victims of terrorism in which re-\nspondents played a role.  The Act provides that respond-\nents, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and \nthe Palestinian Authority (PA), can continue to avoid \nvictims\u2019 lawsuits under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990 \n(ATA), Pub. L. No. 101-519, \u00a7 132, 104 Stat. 2250 (18 \nU.S.C. 2331 et seq.), if they (a) cease making so-called \n\u201cmartyr payments\u201d for Palestinian terrorists who in-\njured or killed Americans, and (b) forgo any operations \non U.S. soil, except for those necessary for their role at \nthe United Nations or for specific interactions, such as \nwith U.S. officials.  See 18 U.S.C. 2334(e).*  Otherwise, \nrespondents would be deemed to consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in ATA suits. \nRespondents did not conform their actions to those \nconditions, despite having promptly done so in response \nto conditions in a predecessor statute, the Anti-Terror-\nism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, 132 Stat. 3183.  See U.S. Br. 10-11.  Respondents \nindisputably continued to make the covered payments, \nand they allegedly continued to engage in nonexempt \nactivities in the United States.  So the plaintiffs in these \n \n*  As in our opening brief, all citations of 18 U.S.C. 2334(e) in this \nbrief refer to the statute as set forth in Supplement IV (2022) of the \nUnited States Code, and all references to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the pe-\ntition appendix in No. 24-20. \n\n3 \n \ncases, terrorism victims and their families, properly in-\nvoked the Act as a basis for personal jurisdiction over \nrespondents.   \nRespondents are wrong in contending that the Act is \nunconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause, which they mistakenly view as impos-\ning schematic and rigid restrictions on personal juris-\ndiction they purport to find in Fourteenth Amendment \ncase law.  The Act provides a fair and reasonable basis \nfor establishing personal jurisdiction by deeming spec-\nified actions having a U.S. nexus as submission to the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts.  The Act\u2019s constitutionality \nis especially clear in light of respondents\u2019 unique status \nas non-sovereign foreign entities that exercise govern-\nmental functions and have been the subject of a distinc-\ntive and multifaceted U.S. policy for decades.  If due \nprocess permits a State to deem any registered busi-\nness to consent to suit on any claim, see Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), then surely this far \nmore narrowly focused Act of Congress is constitu-\ntional.   \nRespondents\u2019 approach to personal jurisdiction es-\nsentially ignores the foregoing features and principles \nsupporting the Act.  Instead, respondents offer differ-\ning accounts of when a party may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.  But in the end, their due process claim reduces \nto the mere assertion (Resp. Br. 2, 41) that their actions \ndid not signify actual \u201csubmission to personal jurisdic-\ntion in the United States\u201d or \u201csupport a presumption\u201d \nof actual submission.  They seemingly contend that a \nparty cannot be deemed to consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion based on conduct that is insufficient to establish \n\u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction\u2014a thesis this Court \n\n4 \n \nhas rejected in a long line of precedents accepting con-\nstructive consent as a separate basis for personal juris-\ndiction, most recently in Mallory.  Most fundamentally, \nhowever, respondents wrongly treat the Act like an ab-\nerrant state law, rather than an Act of Congress that is \nsubject to distinct constitutional analysis under the \nFifth Amendment and rests on sensitive determinations \nof foreign policy and national security by the political \nBranches, to which the courts owe great deference.  The \njudgments of the court of appeals should be reversed. \nA. The Act Fairly And Reasonably Deems Respondents To \nConsent To Personal Jurisdiction  \nFirst and foremost, this Court could reverse the \njudgments below on narrow grounds.  Even assuming \narguendo that the same general due process standards \ngovern personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amend-\nment as under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Act \npasses muster.  By any measure, the Act comports with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted).  Respondents make no \nmeaningful argument that the Act is unfair, and for \ngood reason:  any such assertion would fail. \n1. Respondents misunderstand this Court\u2019s construc-\ntive-consent precedents \na. Respondents accept that a \u201cvariety of legal ar-\nrangements\u201d can support actual or constructive consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insurance Corp. of Ir., \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. \n694, 703 (1982); see Resp. Br. 27.  As we have explained \n(U.S. Br. 24-26), constructive consent is consistent with \ndue process if it is based on a voluntary act and is not \n\n5 \n \nunfair or exorbitant\u2014for example, where the voluntary \nact relates to the forum and implicates its interests.  \nWhile actual consent is not required, a State may not \ndeem any action whatsoever to constitute submission to \nthe jurisdiction of the forum.  Ibid.  Respondents thus \nattack a strawman in arguing (Br. 3, 27, 41-42) that con-\nstructive consent cannot be decreed at the lawmaker\u2019s \nwhim. \nRespondents object that the constitutional standard \nwe submit is applicable in this case\u2014that constructive \nconsent is consistent with due process if based on a vol-\nuntary act and is not unfair or exorbitant\u2014is \u201cad hoc\u201d \nand \u201c\u200a\u2018flexible.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. 39 (citation omitted).  But due pro-\ncess, both in general and as applied to personal jurisdic-\ntion, resists \u201cmechanical or quantitative\u201d analysis.  In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 319; see Jennings v. Ro-\ndriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 314 (2018).  No inflexible stand-\nard would encompass all the various bases for personal \njurisdiction, and the different forms of constructive con-\nsent in particular, that this Court has upheld under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  It is the basic requirements \nof fairness and absence of exorbitance in the particular \ncontext that undergirds them all. \nAccordingly, the same sorts of fairness factors that \nthis Court has considered in non-consent \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d cases also inform the due process inquiry in \nconsent cases, contra Resp. Br. 40.  Whether a party \nmay be deemed to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by \nnot complying with jurisdictional discovery orders, for \nexample, can depend on considerations like the extent \nto which the party was warned of the jurisdictional con-\nsequence and the reasonableness of that consequence.  \nSee Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 707-708; cf. Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409, 444 (1897) (entering judgment as \n\n6 \n \n\u201cpunish[ment]\u201d for contempt violated due process).  \nWhether a visiting motorist may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction in the courts of a State by driv-\ning on its public highways can depend on whether the \nconsent statute ensures adequate notice of any suit.  See \nWuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13, 18-19 (1928) (distin-\nguishing Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), on that \nbasis).  The question is whether, under the circum-\nstances, a finding of constructive consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in the forum is \u201cso deeply unfair that it vio-\nlates the [defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to due pro-\ncess.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in the judgment); see id. at 146 n.11 \n(plurality opinion). \nb. Respondents offer no plausible alternative stand-\nard for distinguishing valid constructive consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction from an unconstitutional \u201cmere asser-\ntion\u201d of judicial power over a foreign defendant.  Chi-\ncago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U.S. 25, 29 (1917); see \nid. at 29-30 (\u201cwhat acts of the defendant shall be deemed \na submission to [a court\u2019s] power is a matter upon which \nStates may differ\u201d). \nRather, respondents repeatedly imply that construc-\ntive consent is not a viable basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion at all, despite the \u201clegion of precedents\u201d to the con-\ntrary.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion).  They \nrecurringly posit (Resp. Br. 1, 29, 33-35, 38-39, 68-69) \nthat consent cannot be premised on conduct that has \nbeen found insufficient for general or specific personal \njurisdiction under a minimum-contacts theory (see U.S. \nBr. 22).  That is clearly wrong.  This Court has recog-\nnized consent as an independent basis for personal ju-\nrisdiction from the start.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 138, \n\n7 \n \n145 (plurality opinion) (citing, e.g., York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15, 19-21 (1890)); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting). \nNor, contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, may a de-\nfendant be deemed to submit to the jurisdiction of the \nforum\u2019s courts only if it harbors an actual \u201cintention to \nsubmit.\u201d  Br. 29 (citation omitted).  Constructive con-\nsent does not require the defendant to have \u201creally sub-\nmitted to proceedings\u201d in the forum State\u2014that is what \nmakes the consent constructive.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n144 (plurality opinion).  In suggesting otherwise, respond-\nents rely on an inapplicable decision addressing state \nsovereign immunity, College Savings Bank v. Florida \nPrepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 \nU.S. 666 (1999).  Resp. Br. 10, 12, 21-23 & n.7, 41; cf. \nU.S. Br. 39-40.  But while constructive consent may not \nbe \u201ccommonly associated\u201d with many other constitu-\ntional protections, such as state sovereign immunity, \nResp. Br. 23 n.7 (quoting College Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681), it has been associated with the one at issue here\u2014\ndue process constraints on personal jurisdiction\u2014for \nmore than a century.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93 \n(1917). \nWhen respondents do acknowledge the possibility of \nconstructive consent to personal jurisdiction, they ini-\ntially gesture toward the categories that the Second \nCircuit recognized below.  They thus suggest that con-\nsent can be grounded only in the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in \nthe litigation itself\u200a\u201d or its \u201cacceptance of a government \nbenefit or privilege.\u201d  Resp. Br. 19, 22-23; cf. Pet. App. \n24a (\u201clitigation-related activities or reciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d).  But, like the court of appeals, they never ex-\nplain what unites those categories to the exclusion of \nothers.  See U.S. Br. 39.   \n\n8 \n \nAny such effort would be unavailing.  The reason why \ncertain litigation conduct and reciprocal bargains can be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction is because the \nconsent is based on voluntary action and it is fundamen-\ntally fair in the circumstances to establish personal ju-\nrisdiction as a consequence.  For instance, consent based \non a defendant\u2019s voluntary litigation conduct can be ef-\nfective when the conduct itself suggests the defendant \nlacks a sound defense to personal jurisdiction.  See \nResp. Br. 20-21 (discussing Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 705).  But other forms of litigation activity can suffice \ntoo, despite the absence of any similar inference, be-\ncause consent is grounded in voluntary action that is \nfairly regarded as submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.  \nSee Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68 (1938) (filing \nsuit in state court was validly deemed consent to juris-\ndiction on a counterclaim). \nIn the end, however, respondents appear to agree \nthat \u201cother conduct\u201d besides litigation activity and ex-\nchanges of benefits may \u201c\u200a\u2018amount[] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u2019\u200a\u201d consistent with \ndue process.  Br. 27 (quoting Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 704-705).  The Fourteenth Amendment requires only \nthat such conduct be voluntary and the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction not be unfair or exorbitant. \n2. The Act is consistent with Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process principles \na. The Act comfortably satisfies that standard.  No \none disputes that the conduct giving rise to consent un-\nder the statute\u2019s \u201cpayments\u201d and \u201cactivities\u201d prongs is \nvoluntary.  18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A) and (B); see U.S. Br. \n27.  And the Act is eminently fair and reasonable.  Re-\nspondents are sophisticated entities that exercise gov-\nernmental functions and operate on the international \n\n9 \n \nplane, and they have had a long, distinctive, and multi-\nfaceted relationship with the United States.  U.S. Br. \n28-30.  That course of dealing has entailed reciprocal \nundertakings and substantial benefits conferred and \nconditions imposed by the United States on respond-\nents, and engagement on respondents\u2019 relation to acts \nof terrorism affecting U.S. nationals has been a central \nconcern of the United States for many years.  Respond-\nents have also long had a presence in the United States, \nand they have litigated numerous ATA cases here.  Im-\nportantly, the actions triggering consent and the nar-\nrow set of cases covered by the Act involve U.S. terri-\ntory or nationals, and the Act serves vital U.S. interests.  \nCf. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 164 (Barrett, J., dissenting) \n(consent statute extended to cases \u201cwith no connection \nwhatsoever to the forum\u201d).  Respondents were made \nfully aware of the conduct that would be deemed con-\nsent under the Act, concededly engaged in covered con-\nduct, and thereby submitted to federal-court jurisdic-\ntion under the Act\u2019s tailored terms. \nTellingly, respondents do not complain of any lack of \nnotice or contend that litigating these cases in the \nUnited States would force them to bear an unfair or un-\nmanageable burden.  And respondents recognize that if \nthey were natural persons, mere service of process in \nthis country would establish \u201ctag\u201d jurisdiction over \nthem; their only response (Br. 50) is that they are not \nnatural persons, but rather entities that act through \n\u201cambassador[s]\u201d and other agents.  Respondents do not \nexplain why that distinction should be dispositive, or \nwhy this consequence of their rigid and restrictive due \nprocess theory does not seriously undermine that the-\nory.  See Pet. App. 239a, 247a-248a (Menashi, J., dis-\nsenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n\n10 \n \nRespondents also do not dispute (Br. 43) that if the \nUnited States recognized them as sovereigns, they \nwould not have constitutional due process rights at all.  \nRespondents just note that they would then possess \nsovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Im-\nmunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1330, 1441(d), 1602 et \nseq.  But the scope of that immunity is defined by the \nFSIA, with due regard for the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions to the community of nations.  See Republic of Iraq \nv. Beaty, 556 U.S. 848, 856-857 (2009).  Respondents\u2019 re-\njoinder does not support their claim to a constitutional \nright to avoid jurisdiction in these cases.  It would be \nbizarre to afford such a right to respondents based on \ntheir natural-person and non-sovereign status, but not \nto other parties that are similarly situated in relevant \nrespects. \nb. Respondents nevertheless maintain (Br. 28) that \nneither of the two forms of \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d trigger-\ning constructive consent under the Act \u201cprovides a valid \nbasis for \u2018deeming\u2019 that Respondents have \u2018consented\u2019 \nto jurisdiction.\u201d  Respondents are wrong. \ni. Consider the Act\u2019s payments prong, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A).  Besides insisting that the payments for \nterrorists do not suffice for specific jurisdiction\u2014which \nis beside the point, see pp. 6-7, supra\u2014respondents em-\nphasize (Br. 28-30) that those payments do not require \nthe United States\u2019 authorization.  That is beside the point \nas well.  The defendant in Hess v. Pawloski, for exam-\nple, did not need Massachusetts\u2019 permission to drive on \nits highways.  274 U.S. at 353; see United States v. Guest, \n383 U.S. 745, 757 (1966) (describing \u201c[t]he constitutional \nright to travel from one State to another, and neces-\nsarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities \nof interstate commerce in doing so\u201d).  That did not mean \n\n11 \n \nthe Commonwealth violated due process by enacting a \nlaw deeming visiting motorists to consent to personal \njurisdiction.  See Hess, 274 U.S. at 356-357.  Moreover, \nrespondents seem to concede (Br. 30) that Congress \ncould enact legislation penalizing the covered pay-\nments by respondents.  It would be a strange constitu-\ntional rule that nonetheless barred Congress from at-\ntaching consequences to those payments in the manner \nit chose here. \nRespondents also claim (Br. 31) to have \u201cformally re-\nvoked\u201d the payments program last month.  Whether the \nrevocation is a matter of form or substance remains to \nbe seen.  See Adam Rasgon & Aaron Boxerman, Pales-\ntinian Leader Ends Payments to Prisoners Jailed by \nIsrael, N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2025, at A8 (\u201cBoth U.S. and \nIsraeli officials will closely monitor the implementation \nof the new policy to see whether it leads to a genuine \nshift.\u201d).  More to the point, respondents concede that \nthey persisted in making covered payments after the \npayments prong\u2019s effective date.  Pet. App. 16a n.5.  The \nprogram\u2019s purported revocation could only matter if re-\nspondents sustained it for five years.  See 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A) and (2).  For present purposes, then, this \ndevelopment is relevant only insofar as it reinforces the \nvoluntariness of the payments and supports the political \nBranches\u2019 judgment that the Act is an effective means \nof discouraging payments that incentivize terrorism\u2014a \nlongstanding foreign-policy and national-security prior-\nity of the United States.  See U.S. Br. 29, 35-37. \nii. Respondents take much the same flawed ap-\nproach to the activities prong, 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(B).  \nThey note that the covered activities do not render re-\nspondents \u201cat home\u201d and subject to general jurisdiction \n\n12 \n \nin the United States for any claim, Br. 33, 35, 38-39, \neven though no one at this point suggests otherwise.   \nThen, following the Second Circuit\u2019s lead, respond-\nents contend that the Act does not embody a valid ex-\nchange of benefits\u2014which is not required in any event, \nsee pp. 7-8, supra\u2014because the Act itself \u201cdoes not au-\nthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or to \nconduct any activities here.\u201d  Br. 36; see Pet. App. 28a-\n29a.  But they concede (Br. 38) that the Act\u2019s predeces-\nsor, the ATCA, was constitutional, even though that law \nlikewise did not itself a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n83: 20250321114720259_certficate.2024-2020and2024-151.json (score: 0.516)\nNo. 24-20 and 24-151 \n \n   \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES    \n    \n  _________________    \n    \n                                                     MIRIAM FULD, ET AL., PETITIONERS \n                                                                                  v.    \n                                          PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n_______________________________   \n    \n    \n                                              UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER \n                   \nv.    \n                                           PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n                                                          _______________________________            \n \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE    \n    \nIt is hereby certified that all parties required to be served have been served with copies of the  \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE FEDERAL PETITIONER via email and by first-class mail, postage prepaid, \nthis 21ST day of March, 2025.    \n    \n[See Attached Service List]    \n \n As required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document 5973 words, excluding the parts \nof the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

This \nCourt can decide this case by applying that Fourteenth \nAmendment standard to the Act of Congress at issue \nhere.  But in addition, the Constitution, including the \nFifth Amendment, at a minimum affords Congress \nbroader power and greater flexibility to provide for the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts, par-\n\n2 \n \nticularly in contexts implicating foreign affairs and na-\ntional security.   \nCongress passed and the President signed the Pro-\nmoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (Act), Pub. L. No. 116-94, Div. J, Tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, in accordance with those constitu-\ntional principles, to further the Nation\u2019s foreign policy, \nprotect national security, and provide a means to seek \ncompensation for U.S. victims of terrorism in which re-\nspondents played a role.  The Act provides that respond-\nents, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and \nthe Palestinian Authority (PA), can continue to avoid \nvictims\u2019 lawsuits under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990 \n(ATA), Pub. L. No. 101-519, \u00a7 132, 104 Stat. 2250 (18 \nU.S.C. 2331 et seq.), if they (a) cease making so-called \n\u201cmartyr payments\u201d for Palestinian terrorists who in-\njured or killed Americans, and (b) forgo any operations \non U.S. soil, except for those necessary for their role at \nthe United Nations or for specific interactions, such as \nwith U.S. officials.  See 18 U.S.C. 2334(e).*  Otherwise, \nrespondents would be deemed to consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in ATA suits. \nRespondents did not conform their actions to those \nconditions, despite having promptly done so in response \nto conditions in a predecessor statute, the Anti-Terror-\nism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, 132 Stat. 3183.  See U.S. Br. 10-11.  Respondents \nindisputably continued to make the covered payments, \nand they allegedly continued to engage in nonexempt \nactivities in the United States.  So the plaintiffs in these \n \n*  As in our opening brief, all citations of 18 U.S.C. 2334(e) in this \nbrief refer to the statute as set forth in Supplement IV (2022) of the \nUnited States Code, and all references to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the pe-\ntition appendix in No. 24-20. \n\n3 \n \ncases, terrorism victims and their families, properly in-\nvoked the Act as a basis for personal jurisdiction over \nrespondents.   \nRespondents are wrong in contending that the Act is \nunconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause, which they mistakenly view as impos-\ning schematic and rigid restrictions on personal juris-\ndiction they purport to find in Fourteenth Amendment \ncase law.  The Act provides a fair and reasonable basis \nfor establishing personal jurisdiction by deeming spec-\nified actions having a U.S. nexus as submission to the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts.  The Act\u2019s constitutionality \nis especially clear in light of respondents\u2019 unique status \nas non-sovereign foreign entities that exercise govern-\nmental functions and have been the subject of a distinc-\ntive and multifaceted U.S. policy for decades.  If due \nprocess permits a State to deem any registered busi-\nness to consent to suit on any claim, see Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), then surely this far \nmore narrowly focused Act of Congress is constitu-\ntional.   \nRespondents\u2019 approach to personal jurisdiction es-\nsentially ignores the foregoing features and principles \nsupporting the Act.  Instead, respondents offer differ-\ning accounts of when a party may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.  But in the end, their due process claim reduces \nto the mere assertion (Resp. Br. 2, 41) that their actions \ndid not signify actual \u201csubmission to personal jurisdic-\ntion in the United States\u201d or \u201csupport a presumption\u201d \nof actual submission.  They seemingly contend that a \nparty cannot be deemed to consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion based on conduct that is insufficient to establish \n\u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction\u2014a thesis this Court \n\n4 \n \nhas rejected in a long line of precedents accepting con-\nstructive consent as a separate basis for personal juris-\ndiction, most recently in Mallory.  Most fundamentally, \nhowever, respondents wrongly treat the Act like an ab-\nerrant state law, rather than an Act of Congress that is \nsubject to distinct constitutional analysis under the \nFifth Amendment and rests on sensitive determinations \nof foreign policy and national security by the political \nBranches, to which the courts owe great deference.  The \njudgments of the court of appeals should be reversed. \nA. The Act Fairly And Reasonably Deems Respondents To \nConsent To Personal Jurisdiction  \nFirst and foremost, this Court could reverse the \njudgments below on narrow grounds.  Even assuming \narguendo that the same general due process standards \ngovern personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amend-\nment as under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Act \npasses muster.  By any measure, the Act comports with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted).  Respondents make no \nmeaningful argument that the Act is unfair, and for \ngood reason:  any such assertion would fail. \n1. Respondents misunderstand this Court\u2019s construc-\ntive-consent precedents \na. Respondents accept that a \u201cvariety of legal ar-\nrangements\u201d can support actual or constructive consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insurance Corp. of Ir., \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. \n694, 703 (1982); see Resp. Br. 27.  As we have explained \n(U.S. Br. 24-26), constructive consent is consistent with \ndue process if it is based on a voluntary act and is not \n\n5 \n \nunfair or exorbitant\u2014for example, where the voluntary \nact relates to the forum and implicates its interests.  \nWhile actual consent is not required, a State may not \ndeem any action whatsoever to constitute submission to \nthe jurisdiction of the forum.  Ibid.  Respondents thus \nattack a strawman in arguing (Br. 3, 27, 41-42) that con-\nstructive consent cannot be decreed at the lawmaker\u2019s \nwhim. \nRespondents object that the constitutional standard \nwe submit is applicable in this case\u2014that constructive \nconsent is consistent with due process if based on a vol-\nuntary act and is not unfair or exorbitant\u2014is \u201cad hoc\u201d \nand \u201c\u200a\u2018flexible.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. 39 (citation omitted).  But due pro-\ncess, both in general and as applied to personal jurisdic-\ntion, resists \u201cmechanical or quantitative\u201d analysis.  In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 319; see Jennings v. Ro-\ndriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 314 (2018).  No inflexible stand-\nard would encompass all the various bases for personal \njurisdiction, and the different forms of constructive con-\nsent in particular, that this Court has upheld under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  It is the basic requirements \nof fairness and absence of exorbitance in the particular \ncontext that undergirds them all. \nAccordingly, the same sorts of fairness factors that \nthis Court has considered in non-consent \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d cases also inform the due process inquiry in \nconsent cases, contra Resp. Br. 40.  Whether a party \nmay be deemed to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by \nnot complying with jurisdictional discovery orders, for \nexample, can depend on considerations like the extent \nto which the party was warned of the jurisdictional con-\nsequence and the reasonableness of that consequence.  \nSee Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 707-708; cf. Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409, 444 (1897) (entering judgment as \n\n6 \n \n\u201cpunish[ment]\u201d for contempt violated due process).  \nWhether a visiting motorist may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction in the courts of a State by driv-\ning on its public highways can depend on whether the \nconsent statute ensures adequate notice of any suit.  See \nWuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13, 18-19 (1928) (distin-\nguishing Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), on that \nbasis).  The question is whether, under the circum-\nstances, a finding of constructive consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in the forum is \u201cso deeply unfair that it vio-\nlates the [defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to due pro-\ncess.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in the judgment); see id. at 146 n.11 \n(plurality opinion). \nb. Respondents offer no plausible alternative stand-\nard for distinguishing valid constructive consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction from an unconstitutional \u201cmere asser-\ntion\u201d of judicial power over a foreign defendant.  Chi-\ncago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U.S. 25, 29 (1917); see \nid. at 29-30 (\u201cwhat acts of the defendant shall be deemed \na submission to [a court\u2019s] power is a matter upon which \nStates may differ\u201d). \nRather, respondents repeatedly imply that construc-\ntive consent is not a viable basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion at all, despite the \u201clegion of precedents\u201d to the con-\ntrary.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion).  They \nrecurringly posit (Resp. Br. 1, 29, 33-35, 38-39, 68-69) \nthat consent cannot be premised on conduct that has \nbeen found insufficient for general or specific personal \njurisdiction under a minimum-contacts theory (see U.S. \nBr. 22).  That is clearly wrong.  This Court has recog-\nnized consent as an independent basis for personal ju-\nrisdiction from the start.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 138, \n\n7 \n \n145 (plurality opinion) (citing, e.g., York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15, 19-21 (1890)); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting). \nNor, contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, may a de-\nfendant be deemed to submit to the jurisdiction of the \nforum\u2019s courts only if it harbors an actual \u201cintention to \nsubmit.\u201d  Br. 29 (citation omitted).  Constructive con-\nsent does not require the defendant to have \u201creally sub-\nmitted to proceedings\u201d in the forum State\u2014that is what \nmakes the consent constructive.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n144 (plurality opinion).  In suggesting otherwise, respond-\nents rely on an inapplicable decision addressing state \nsovereign immunity, College Savings Bank v. Florida \nPrepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 \nU.S. 666 (1999).  Resp. Br. 10, 12, 21-23 & n.7, 41; cf. \nU.S. Br. 39-40.  But while constructive consent may not \nbe \u201ccommonly associated\u201d with many other constitu-\ntional protections, such as state sovereign immunity, \nResp. Br. 23 n.7 (quoting College Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681), it has been associated with the one at issue here\u2014\ndue process constraints on personal jurisdiction\u2014for \nmore than a century.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93 \n(1917). \nWhen respondents do acknowledge the possibility of \nconstructive consent to personal jurisdiction, they ini-\ntially gesture toward the categories that the Second \nCircuit recognized below.  They thus suggest that con-\nsent can be grounded only in the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in \nthe litigation itself\u200a\u201d or its \u201cacceptance of a government \nbenefit or privilege.\u201d  Resp. Br. 19, 22-23; cf. Pet. App. \n24a (\u201clitigation-related activities or reciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d).  But, like the court of appeals, they never ex-\nplain what unites those categories to the exclusion of \nothers.  See U.S. Br. 39.   \n\n8 \n \nAny such effort would be unavailing.  The reason why \ncertain litigation conduct and reciprocal bargains can be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction is because the \nconsent is based on voluntary action and it is fundamen-\ntally fair in the circumstances to establish personal ju-\nrisdiction as a consequence.  For instance, consent based \non a defendant\u2019s voluntary litigation conduct can be ef-\nfective when the conduct itself suggests the defendant \nlacks a sound defense to personal jurisdiction.  See \nResp. Br. 20-21 (discussing Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 705).  But other forms of litigation activity can suffice \ntoo, despite the absence of any similar inference, be-\ncause consent is grounded in voluntary action that is \nfairly regarded as submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.  \nSee Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68 (1938) (filing \nsuit in state court was validly deemed consent to juris-\ndiction on a counterclaim). \nIn the end, however, respondents appear to agree \nthat \u201cother conduct\u201d besides litigation activity and ex-\nchanges of benefits may \u201c\u200a\u2018amount[] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u2019\u200a\u201d consistent with \ndue process.  Br. 27 (quoting Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 704-705).  The Fourteenth Amendment requires only \nthat such conduct be voluntary and the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction not be unfair or exorbitant. \n2. The Act is consistent with Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process principles \na. The Act comfortably satisfies that standard.  No \none disputes that the conduct giving rise to consent un-\nder the statute\u2019s \u201cpayments\u201d and \u201cactivities\u201d prongs is \nvoluntary.  18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A) and (B); see U.S. Br. \n27.  And the Act is eminently fair and reasonable.  Re-\nspondents are sophisticated entities that exercise gov-\nernmental functions and operate on the international \n\n9 \n \nplane, and they have had a long, distinctive, and multi-\nfaceted relationship with the United States.  U.S. Br. \n28-30.  That course of dealing has entailed reciprocal \nundertakings and substantial benefits conferred and \nconditions imposed by the United States on respond-\nents, and engagement on respondents\u2019 relation to acts \nof terrorism affecting U.S. nationals has been a central \nconcern of the United States for many years.  Respond-\nents have also long had a presence in the United States, \nand they have litigated numerous ATA cases here.  Im-\nportantly, the actions triggering consent and the nar-\nrow set of cases covered by the Act involve U.S. terri-\ntory or nationals, and the Act serves vital U.S. interests.  \nCf. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 164 (Barrett, J., dissenting) \n(consent statute extended to cases \u201cwith no connection \nwhatsoever to the forum\u201d).  Respondents were made \nfully aware of the conduct that would be deemed con-\nsent under the Act, concededly engaged in covered con-\nduct, and thereby submitted to federal-court jurisdic-\ntion under the Act\u2019s tailored terms. \nTellingly, respondents do not complain of any lack of \nnotice or contend that litigating these cases in the \nUnited States would force them to bear an unfair or un-\nmanageable burden.  And respondents recognize that if \nthey were natural persons, mere service of process in \nthis country would establish \u201ctag\u201d jurisdiction over \nthem; their only response (Br. 50) is that they are not \nnatural persons, but rather entities that act through \n\u201cambassador[s]\u201d and other agents.  Respondents do not \nexplain why that distinction should be dispositive, or \nwhy this consequence of their rigid and restrictive due \nprocess theory does not seriously undermine that the-\nory.  See Pet. App. 239a, 247a-248a (Menashi, J., dis-\nsenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n\n10 \n \nRespondents also do not dispute (Br. 43) that if the \nUnited States recognized them as sovereigns, they \nwould not have constitutional due process rights at all.  \nRespondents just note that they would then possess \nsovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Im-\nmunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1330, 1441(d), 1602 et \nseq.  But the scope of that immunity is defined by the \nFSIA, with due regard for the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions to the community of nations.  See Republic of Iraq \nv. Beaty, 556 U.S. 848, 856-857 (2009).  Respondents\u2019 re-\njoinder does not support their claim to a constitutional \nright to avoid jurisdiction in these cases.  It would be \nbizarre to afford such a right to respondents based on \ntheir natural-person and non-sovereign status, but not \nto other parties that are similarly situated in relevant \nrespects. \nb. Respondents nevertheless maintain (Br. 28) that \nneither of the two forms of \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d trigger-\ning constructive consent under the Act \u201cprovides a valid \nbasis for \u2018deeming\u2019 that Respondents have \u2018consented\u2019 \nto jurisdiction.\u201d  Respondents are wrong. \ni. Consider the Act\u2019s payments prong, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A).  Besides insisting that the payments for \nterrorists do not suffice for specific jurisdiction\u2014which \nis beside the point, see pp. 6-7, supra\u2014respondents em-\nphasize (Br. 28-30) that those payments do not require \nthe United States\u2019 authorization.  That is beside the point \nas well.  The defendant in Hess v. Pawloski, for exam-\nple, did not need Massachusetts\u2019 permission to drive on \nits highways.  274 U.S. at 353; see United States v. Guest, \n383 U.S. 745, 757 (1966) (describing \u201c[t]he constitutional \nright to travel from one State to another, and neces-\nsarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities \nof interstate commerce in doing so\u201d).  That did not mean \n\n11 \n \nthe Commonwealth violated due process by enacting a \nlaw deeming visiting motorists to consent to personal \njurisdiction.  See Hess, 274 U.S. at 356-357.  Moreover, \nrespondents seem to concede (Br. 30) that Congress \ncould enact legislation penalizing the covered pay-\nments by respondents.  It would be a strange constitu-\ntional rule that nonetheless barred Congress from at-\ntaching consequences to those payments in the manner \nit chose here. \nRespondents also claim (Br. 31) to have \u201cformally re-\nvoked\u201d the payments program last month.  Whether the \nrevocation is a matter of form or substance remains to \nbe seen.  See Adam Rasgon & Aaron Boxerman, Pales-\ntinian Leader Ends Payments to Prisoners Jailed by \nIsrael, N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2025, at A8 (\u201cBoth U.S. and \nIsraeli officials will closely monitor the implementation \nof the new policy to see whether it leads to a genuine \nshift.\u201d).  More to the point, respondents concede that \nthey persisted in making covered payments after the \npayments prong\u2019s effective date.  Pet. App. 16a n.5.  The \nprogram\u2019s purported revocation could only matter if re-\nspondents sustained it for five years.  See 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A) and (2).  For present purposes, then, this \ndevelopment is relevant only insofar as it reinforces the \nvoluntariness of the payments and supports the political \nBranches\u2019 judgment that the Act is an effective means \nof discouraging payments that incentivize terrorism\u2014a \nlongstanding foreign-policy and national-security prior-\nity of the United States.  See U.S. Br. 29, 35-37. \nii. Respondents take much the same flawed ap-\nproach to the activities prong, 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(B).  \nThey note that the covered activities do not render re-\nspondents \u201cat home\u201d and subject to general jurisdiction \n\n12 \n \nin the United States for any claim, Br. 33, 35, 38-39, \neven though no one at this point suggests otherwise.   \nThen, following the Second Circuit\u2019s lead, respond-\nents contend that the Act does not embody a valid ex-\nchange of benefits\u2014which is not required in any event, \nsee pp. 7-8, supra\u2014because the Act itself \u201cdoes not au-\nthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or to \nconduct any activities here.\u201d  Br. 36; see Pet. App. 28a-\n29a.  But they concede (Br. 38) that the Act\u2019s predeces-\nsor, the ATCA, was constitutional, even though that law \nlikewise did not itself authorize any activities in the \nUnited States.  The ATCA referred to possible authori-\nzation through other legal means:  it deemed respond-\nents to consent to personal jurisdiction if they engaged \nin certain U.S. activities while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver \nor suspension of section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act \nof 1987,\u201d \u00a7 4(a), 132 Stat. 3184, which largely prohibits \nthe PLO from operating in the United States.  Respond-\nents do not explain why it matters under the Due Pro-\ncess Clause whether the covered activities are permit-\nted in the United States via a formal \u201cwaiver or suspen-\nsion,\u201d ibid.; lawful by virtue of limits on statutory re-\nstrictions governing respondents\u2019 U.S. activities, see \nU.S. Br. 42 (discussing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7, 120 Stat. 3324 (22 \nU.S.C. 2378b note)); allowed as a matter of enforcement \ndiscretion, id. at 42-43; or are not authorized at all, Pet. \nApp. 249a-250a (Menashi, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).  Even if an exchange were required \nin this context, the Act contemplates one. \nRespondents dispute at length (Br. 34, 70-77) the \nplaintiffs\u2019 allegations that respondents triggered the ac-\ntivities prong.  That issue is not properly before this \nCourt because the court of appeals held the Act facially \n\n13 \n \nunconstitutional, without determining whether the ac-\ntivities prong was satisfied.  U.S. Br. 14-15; see Cutter \nv. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (this Court is \none \u201cof review, not of first view\u201d).  But respondents\u2019 ef-\nfort to minimize the extent of their U.S. activities does \nhighlight a basic flaw in the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning.  \nUnder the court\u2019s logic, respondents would be constitu-\ntionally entitled to avoid ATA suits\u2014and potential ac-\ncountability for involvement in acts of terror that in-\njured or killed Americans\u2014even if respondents en-\ngaged in extensive activities on U.S. soil.  Due process \ndoes not demand such a bizarre and inequitable result. \nB. Congress In Any Event Has Broader Authority Than A \nState To Provide For Personal Jurisdiction  \nThe Act would be constitutional even if it did not sat-\nisfy due process limits on personal jurisdiction as artic-\nulated under the Fourteenth Amendment in cases in-\nvolving state courts\u2019 exercises of personal jurisdiction.  \nThis case arises in a starkly different context:  It in-\nvolves an Act of Congress providing for personal juris-\ndiction over sui generis foreign entities in federal cases \naffecting U.S. nationals and involving vital interests of \nthe Nation as a whole.  The political Branches have \nbroad constitutional power in the realms of foreign re-\nlations and national security, and their judgment con-\ncerning appropriate measures to be taken in those \nrealms and the interests of foreign parties affected are \nentitled to great weight.  Hernandez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. \n93, 103-104 (2020).  Congress also has unquestioned au-\nthority to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \nincluding personal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Sealed \nCase, 932 F.3d 915, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (collecting fed-\neral statutes authorizing nationwide service of process).  \nParticularly in the context presented here, but more \n\n14 \n \ngenerally too, the Fifth Amendment affords Congress \ngreater flexibility to provide for personal jurisdiction \nthan the Fourteenth Amendment affords the States.  \nThe court of appeals erred in holding otherwise. \n1. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments do not  \nrestrict personal jurisdiction in parallel \na. As we have noted (U.S. Br. 21-22), this Court has \nrepeatedly reserved the question whether the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments impose the same limits on \nfederal and state courts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion.  But it is hard to see how they could.  A central \npurpose of Fourteenth Amendment \u201cjurisdictional due \nprocess\u201d is safeguarding federalism, by ensuring that \nStates do not exceed territorial limits on their sover-\neignty and adjudicate disputes that, in our federal sys-\ntem, are not properly their business.  See Ford Motor \nCo. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 \n(2021); Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct., 582 \nU.S. 255, 263 (2017).  The personal rights of litigants as \nagainst a particular State\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction \nmust be understood in light of our constitutional struc-\nture of separate States functioning under reciprocal \nterritorial limitations.  Thus, like the court of appeals, \nsee Pet. App. 48a, respondents overread (Br. 15) state-\nments in Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 702 & n.10, that \ndownplay\u2014contrary to many other precedents, like \nFord Motor and Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2014the role that \nfederalism plays in the due process inquiry under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See 4 Charles Alan Wright et \nal., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1067.1, at 381 (4th \ned. 2015) (Wright) (noting that \u201cit does not seem plausi-\nble\u201d to read federalism out of the analysis). \nFederalism concerns, of course, are inapplicable \nwhen Congress provides for the exercise of personal ju-\n\n15 \n \nrisdiction over foreign defendants in federal court.  See \nU.S. Br. 31-34.  The Second Circuit nevertheless held \nthat \u201cthe due process analyses under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments parallel one another in civil \ncases.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a.   \nRespondents\u2019 defense of that holding is unpersua-\nsive.  Indeed, they initially defend it (Br. 47-48) only for \n\u201cconsent statute[s],\u201d principally citing Justice Alito\u2019s \nopinion in Mallory for the notion that federalism con-\ncerns \u201cplay no role\u201d in the consent context.  But Justice \nAlito\u2019s opinion did not endorse that proposition.  He \nmerely concluded that \u201cthe most appropriate home\u201d for \nfederalism concerns in consent cases is the \u201cdormant \nCommerce Clause.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 150 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment); see \nid. at 154-163.   \nNor is respondents\u2019 proposition tenable.  To be sure, \nan individual defendant\u2019s actual consent to suit may \npose little threat to the integrity of the Union\u2019s federal \nstructure, just as an individual defendant\u2019s waiver of his \nright to counsel does not threaten the vitality of the \nSixth Amendment.  But some state laws deeming par-\nties to constructively consent to personal jurisdiction \ncould pose an obvious risk of \u201csubvert[ing] interstate \nfederalism.\u201d  U.S. Amicus Br. at 4, Mallory, supra (No. \n21-1168).  Federal statutes like the Act in this case pre-\nsent no such danger, and Congress thus enjoys broader \nauthority than a State to provide for constructive con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction by foreign defendants.  \nWhich \u201cparticular constitutional provision\u201d embodies \nthese principles is not of paramount importance, Attor-\nney Gen. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 902-903 (1986) \n(plurality opinion), as respondents elsewhere agree, Br. \n63. \n\n16 \n \nIn the alternative, respondents endorse (Br. 48-50) \nthe more categorical view, held by the Second Circuit in \nthis case and several of its sister circuits, that the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendment rules for personal jurisdic-\ntion are the same across the board.  But neither the tex-\ntual parallels between the Due Process Clauses nor in-\ndividual-liberty interests support that simplistic under-\nstanding.  See U.S. Br. 31-32, 45-46.  This Court\u2019s re-\npeated indications that Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process may differ foreshadowed cases like \nthis.  As the Court noted in French v. Barber Asphalt \nPaving Co., 181 U.S. 324 (1901), the two Due Process \nClauses \u201cwere ingrafted upon the Constitution at differ-\nent times and in widely different circumstances of our \nnational life,\u201d so \u201cit may be that questions may arise in \nwhich different constructions and applications of their \nprovisions may be proper.\u201d  Id. at 328. \nb. Respondents\u2019 concerns (Br. 42-43) about poten-\ntially limitless congressional power to provide for per-\nsonal jurisdiction over foreign defendants are un-\nfounded.  Congress has always enjoyed broad authority \n\u201cto impose jurisdiction over domestic defendants\u201d in \n\u201cfederal question case[s]\u201d because, as the courts of ap-\npeals agree, the Fifth Amendment at most requires the \ndefendant to have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole, which domestic defendants have by \ndefinition.  Resp. Br. 42 (emphasis added); see 4 Wright \n\u00a7 1068.1, at 691-692, 734-737 & n.92.   \nRespondents\u2019 concerns are overstated as to foreign de-\nfendants too.  Because the Act here is narrowly drawn, \nthis case can be decided without any need to identify the \nouter limits of the Fifth Amendment regarding other \nclasses of foreign defendants.  U.S. Br. 34, 47; contra \nResp. Br. 42.  At the same time and for similar reasons, \n\n17 \n \nthe Court also need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 contrary \nassertion (24-20 Pet. Br. 16-29) that the Fifth Amend-\nment, as a matter of original meaning, has nothing to \nsay on the subject of personal jurisdiction.  The main \nacademic proponent of that theory agrees.  See Sachs \nAmicus Br. 6 (\u201cThe Court may uphold [the Act] while \nleaving open the outer limits of what the Fifth Amend-\nment might permit, just as it has for the last two hun-\ndred years.\u201d). \nThis Court should certainly not accept respondents\u2019 \nhistorical arguments, which theorize (Br. 58-64, 66-68) \nthat due process originally confined courts to exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over parties within their territo-\nrial jurisdiction and barred personal-jurisdiction stat-\nutes that were not generally applicable.  As the plain-\ntiffs explain (24-20 Pet. Br. 20-23), however, there is \nscant Founding-era evidence regarding due process \nlimits on personal jurisdiction.  And respondents\u2019 con-\ntention would perversely subject the federal government \nto greater constitutional constraints than the States, \nwhich\u2014as shown by Mallory and other precedents\u2014may \nprovide for personal jurisdiction over defendants lo-\ncated beyond their borders in some circumstances.  See \nBurnham v. Superior Ct., 495 U.S. 604, 618 (1990) (plu-\nrality opinion) (\u201cDue process does not necessarily re-\nquire the States to adhere to the unbending territorial \nlimits on jurisdiction set forth in Pennoyer [v. Neff, 95 \nU.S. 714 (1878)].\u201d).  No authority supports respondents\u2019 \nrestrictive theory of due process under the Fifth \nAmendment, and this Court should reject it. \n2. The political Branches\u2019 foreign-policy and national-\nsecurity judgments carry great weight  \na. Respondents\u2019 contention would also deprive the \npolitical Branches of an important means of exercising \n\n18 \n \ntheir constitutional authorities in the realms of foreign \naffairs and national security.  U.S. Br. 36-37.  Respond-\nents are sui generis foreign non-sovereign entities that \nexercise governmental functions and engage officially \nwith countries around the world.  Resp. Br. 46.  The Act \nis an important component of a decades-long, multifac-\neted effort by the United States, through numerous leg-\nislative and executive actions, to induce respondents to \ncease supporting terrorism\u2014\u201can urgent objective of \nthe highest order,\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian Law Pro-\nject, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010).  See U.S. Br. 34-38; see also \nid. at 6-13 (canvassing history of U.S. relations with re-\nspondents).  Under the Act, respondents must either \nstop making payments for terrorists who harm Ameri-\ncans and refrain from U.S.-based activities, or else be \ndeemed to submit to federal-court jurisdiction in ATA \nsuits.  Both routes offer important benefits to U.S. na-\ntional security and foreign policy, and due process does \nnot place either one off-limits. \nThe Act\u2019s importance is unaffected by the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s observation at an earlier stage of the Sokolow \nlitigation that the United States also has other means of \npursuing its antiterrorism objectives, such as bringing \ncriminal prosecutions for acts of terrorism.  See Resp. \nBr. 6.  ATA suits are an important complement to those \ntools, as Congress recognized in enacting and strength-\nening the ATA.  See, e.g., Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act, Pub. L. No. 114-222, \u00a7 4, 130 Stat. 854 \n(2016).  The United States thus has always maintained \nthat \u201c[p]rivate actions under the Anti-Terrorism Act \nare an important means of fighting terrorism and \nproviding redress for victims of terrorist attacks and \ntheir families.\u201d  U.S. Amicus Br. at 7, Sokolow v. Pales-\ntine Liberation Org., No. 16-1071 (Feb. 22, 2018).   \n\n19 \n \nSince 2018, Congress, with the President\u2019s approval, \nhas strongly reinforced that position by enacting the \nATCA and then replacing it with the law at issue here.  \nAnd in statutes like the Taylor Force Act, Pub. L. No. \n115-141, Div. S, Tit. X, 132 Stat. 1143 (22 U.S.C. 2378c-\n1 note), the political Branches have likewise reaffirmed \nthe United States\u2019 strong interest in using all appropri-\nate means to address respondents\u2019 support for terror-\nism.  U.S. Br. 8. \nBy contrast, given the territorial limits on state au-\nthority, a State could not enact an extraterritorial stat-\nute like the ATA.  U.S. Br. 33.  And by virtue of the fed-\neral government\u2019s \u201cbroad authority over foreign af-\nfairs,\u201d Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10 (1982), no State \ncould engage with foreign actors like respondents in the \nway that the United States has done.  Those critical dif-\nferences necessitate a different due process analysis of \nthis Act of Congress as compared to a state personal-\njurisdiction law.   \nb. Respondents essentially concede (Br. 45-46, 51) \nthat they have a unique status and relationship with the \nUnited States involving a long-running exchange of un-\ndertakings, restrictions, concessions, and other commit-\nments.  But they deny the significance of that context.  \nAt the threshold, respondents claim (Br. 52) that the \ngovernment \u201cwaived\u201d this point, even though it plainly \nmade the argument below.  See, e.g., Fuld Gov\u2019t C.A. \nBr. 24 (emphasizing that \u201c[t]he PA and PLO are sui \ngeneris foreign entities that exercise governmental \npower but have not been recognized as a sovereign gov-\nernment by the Executive Branch, and that have a \nunique relationship with the United States\u201d); Sokolow \nGov\u2019t C.A. Br. 22 (same). \n\n20 \n \nOn the merits, respondents contend (Br. 43-44, 69-\n70) that the Act\u2019s careful tailoring to cover only re-\nspondents and their successors and affiliates, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(5), is not a virtue, but a due process flaw.  That \ncontention is without merit.  \u201cWhile legislatures usually \nact through laws of general applicability, that is by no \nmeans their only legitimate mode of action.\u201d  Plaut v. \nSpendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 239 n.9 (1995).  \nThis Court has regularly \u201cupheld as a valid exercise of \nCongress\u2019 legislative power diverse laws that governed \none or a very small number of specific subjects.\u201d  Bank \nMarkazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 234 (2016); see ibid. \n(collecting cases); see also, e.g., TikTok Inc. v. Garland, \n145 S. Ct. 57 (2025).  Respondents\u2019 position is also im-\npossible to square with their acceptance (Br. 37-38) of \nthe constitutionality of the ATCA, which was also nar-\nrowly scoped. \nAlthough narrow laws may raise constitutional con-\ncerns \u201cif arbitrary or inadequately justified,\u201d Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 234 n.27, respondents do not at-\ntempt such a showing with respect to this Act.  Nor \ncould they.  Respondents\u2019 history of relations with and \nactivities in the United States, their frequent litigation \nunder the ATA (the enactment of which was prompted \nby PLO terrorist activities, see U.S. Br. 8), their pres-\nence at the United Nations and prominence in the inter-\nnational arena, and other distinctive factors made it rea-\nsonable for Congress to limit the Act\u2019s scope to respond-\nents.  Other foreign entities involved in terrorism\u2014such \nas Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State\u2014are not \nvalid comparators in these respects, contra Resp. Br. \n46.  That Congress has chosen different methods to ad-\ndress their threats to U.S. interests, see, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \n9402(b)(5) (requiring an Executive Branch assessment \n\n21 \n \nof Iran\u2019s support for Hezbollah, Hamas, et al.), does not \npose any constitutional issue, much less one fit for judi-\ncial resolution. \nc. The Second Circuit nevertheless engaged in the \nsame kind of second-guessing of the political Branches \nurged by respondents, ignoring that \u201c[t]he political \nbranches, not the Judiciary, have the responsibility and \ninstitutional capacity to weigh foreign-policy concerns.\u201d  \nHernandez, 589 U.S. at 103-104.  The court of appeals \ndeprecated the Act\u2019s payments prong, for instance, by \nnoting that \u201cCongress has a variety of other tools at its \ndisposal for discouraging the payments in question.\u201d  \nPet. App. 27a.  And it backhandedly acknowledged the \nsensitive questions of foreign and national-security pol-\nicy that underlie the Act only after already deeming the \nstatute invalid\u2014having assessed its constitutionality \nunder precedents predominantly involving state courts\u2019 \nassertion of personal jurisdiction over garden-variety \ndomestic entities (or cases not involving personal juris-\ndiction at all, like College Savings Bank).  Id. at 45a-\n46a; see id. at 16a-24a.   \nAs \u201can exercise of congressional authority regarding \nforeign affairs, a domain in which the controlling role of \nthe political branches is both necessary and proper,\u201d the \nAct \u201cwarrants respectful review by courts.\u201d  Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 215, 234; accord TikTok, 145 S. Ct. \nat 70 (affording \u201csubstantial respect\u201d to \u201cthe Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018informed judgment\u2019\u200a\u201d in matters of national se-\ncurity and foreign policy) (citation omitted).  That does \nnot mean \u201cabdication of the judicial role.\u201d  See Human-\nitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. at 34.  But it does mean \nthe Second Circuit erred by treating the Act as equiva-\nlent to a state personal-jurisdiction law and by assign-\ning no discernible weight to the political Branches\u2019 \n\n22 \n \njudgments in their proper constitutional domain.  The \nAct satisfies the Fifth Amendment. \nC. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support Reversal \nRespondents also contend (Br. 68-70), principally re-\nlying on Bank Markazi, supra, that the Act offends the \nseparation of powers by directing courts to find consent \nbased on actions that do not independently establish \npersonal jurisdiction.  As we have noted, however, see \npp. 6-7, supra, constructive consent is a long-recognized \nand independent basis for personal jurisdiction.  Any \nconstructive-consent statute will provide for courts to \ndeem certain conduct, if they find it occurred, as sub-\nmission to the jurisdiction of the courts. \nThe Act comports with the separation of powers for \nmuch the same reason as did the statute the Court up-\nheld in Bank Markazi (which likewise involved civil ter-\nrorism suits against foreign actors):  it creates \u201ca new \nlegal standard\u201d for courts to apply, rather than usurp-\ning the judicial function by simply directing a result un-\nder existing law.  578 U.S. at 230.  Indeed, the law in \nBank Markazi rendered specific assets available to sat-\nisfy judgments in specific proceedings identified by dis-\ntrict-court docket number.  Id. at 215; see 22 U.S.C. 8772.  \nBy contrast, the Act here covers ATA suits against re-\nspondents as a class; sets a prospective legal standard \nthat would or would not be triggered; and provides a \nbasis for exercising jurisdiction with full notice to re-\nspondents of the actions that would trigger it.  18 U.S.C. \n2334(e).  That is a quintessentially legislative provision, \nnot an adjudicative measure falling outside of Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional remit. \nIt is respondents\u2019 and the court of appeals\u2019 position \nthat raises separation-of-powers concerns.  The Consti-\ntution vests Congress with authority to establish infe-\n\n23 \n \nrior federal courts and to regulate their jurisdiction.  \nSee U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 9; Art. III, \u00a7 1; Lockerty \nv. Phillips, 319 U.S. 182, 187-188 (1943).  Congress\u2019s ex-\nercises of that authority, like its other enactments, are \nentitled to a presumption of constitutionality.  United \nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000).  And that \npresumption carries particular weight when the politi-\ncal Branches act, as here, in the realm of foreign affairs, \nwhere their \u201ccontrolling role  * * *  is both necessary \nand proper\u201d under our constitutional structure.  Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 234.  In holding the Act unconsti-\ntutional, the court of appeals disregarded those funda-\nmental principles. \n* * * * * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in our \nopening brief, the judgments of the court of appeals \nshould be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted.   \n \n \nSARAH M. HARRIS \nActing Solicitor General \n \nMARCH 2025",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal dynamics has been substantially advanced by the petitioners' merits brief. This observation directly answers the key questions I had after analyzing the respondents' brief in opposition, revealing the petitioners' core legal strategy and refining my prediction model. My beliefs now incorporate the petitioners' offensive strategy alongside the respondents' previously understood defensive posture.\n\nMy updated beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Petitioners' Primary Strategy is a Fundamental Challenge to Modern Jurisdictional Doctrine:** The petitioners are not merely arguing within the confines of the *International Shoe* framework. Their lead argument is that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, based on its original public meaning in 1791, imposes **no constitutional limit on Congress's power to authorize personal jurisdiction** over defendants for conduct occurring abroad.\n    *   **Originalist Argument:** They contend that at the Founding, jurisdictional limits were a matter of the law of nations and comity, which Congress had the sovereign power to override, not a constitutional command. They cite Founding-era statutes (Crimes Act of 1790, Judiciary Act of 1789) and judicial opinions (Justice Story in *Picquet v. Swan*) to support this.\n    *   **Fifth vs. Fourteenth Amendment Distinction:** This argument hinges on a crucial distinction: the Fourteenth Amendment's jurisdictional limits (*International Shoe*, *Bristol-Myers Squibb*) are rooted in \"interstate federalism\" to protect states from overreach by other states. They argue these federalism-based constraints do not apply to the federal government, which possesses national sovereign authority in matters of foreign policy and national security. They cite cases like *United States v. Bennett* to show the Court has historically refused to import 14th Amendment limits onto the 5th.\n\n*   **The Petitioners' Fallback Strategy is to Win Under the Modern Framework via *Mallory*:** Should the Court decline their primary originalist argument, petitioners have a robust secondary argument that the PSJVTA is constitutional even under the modern Fourteenth Amendment framework.\n    *   **Direct Rebuttal on *Mallory*:** They directly counter the respondents' attempt to distinguish *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* They argue the PSJVTA operates on the same principle of \"consent-by-conduct.\" Just as Norfolk Southern consented to jurisdiction by registering to do business, the PLO and PA consented by engaging in conduct (making payments to terrorists' families) that Congress had explicitly and prospectively warned would trigger jurisdiction.\n    *   **Direct Rebuttal on \"Reciprocal Benefit\":** They preemptively counter the respondents' argument that consent requires a \"reciprocal bargain.\" They argue that *Mallory* did not require a specific benefit, only consent based on a pre-declared statutory condition. Furthermore, they argue that even if a benefit were required, the PLO and PA receive one: the ability to conduct any activities within the United States, a privilege granted and conditioned by Congress (e.g., via exceptions for UN-related work in the PSJVTA itself).\n\n*   **Strategic Choices Have Narrowed the Case's Focus:** The petitioners' brief clarifies the legal battleground.\n    *   **\"Not a Person\" Argument Abandoned:** The brief does not advance the theory that the PLO and PA are not \"persons\" entitled to due process. This confirms my prior belief that the respondents' forfeiture argument was potent, and it removes a potential procedural off-ramp, forcing a decision on the core jurisdictional question.\n    *   **Focus on Congressional Power:** The case is now squarely framed as a contest between congressional power to legislate on foreign affairs and terrorism versus judicially created due process limits on personal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **Uncertainty is Now Highly Refined and Focused on Judicial Reception:** My uncertainty has shifted from the parties' arguments to the Justices' likely reactions.\n    1.  **The Originalism Question:** The primary uncertainty is whether the Court's originalist/textualist majority will be receptive to the petitioners' bold argument to fundamentally separate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment jurisdictional analyses. This would be a landmark ruling with implications far beyond this case.\n    2.  **The *Mallory* Extension Question:** If the Court avoids the broader originalist question, how will it view extending *Mallory*'s consent theory from corporate registration (a traditional commercial context) to conduct related to terrorism and foreign affairs? This is a significant legal leap.\n    3.  **The Government's Position:** The brief of the United States, as a co-petitioner, is now the most critical missing piece of evidence. Will the Solicitor General endorse the sweeping originalist argument, or will they offer a more restrained defense of congressional power focused on the *Mallory* analogy? The government's choice will significantly signal the executive branch's view on the separation of powers and could heavily influence the Court.\n    4.  **The Respondents' Counter-Merits Brief:** How will the respondents now pivot to rebut this two-pronged attack, particularly the powerful originalist argument for which their BIO may not have been fully prepared? Their response to the claim that 14th Amendment doctrine is simply inapplicable will be crucial.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape has been critically refined by the Reply Brief for the Federal Petitioner (the United States). This observation directly resolves my most significant prior uncertainty: the strategic position of the Solicitor General (SG). The SG's brief does not merely echo the private petitioners' arguments; its structure and emphasis provide a strong signal about the most likely path the government wants the Court to take, substantially altering my predictive model.\n\nMy updated beliefs, which build upon my prior understanding of the petitioners' two-pronged strategy, are as follows:\n\n*   **The U.S. Government is Advocating for a Narrow Ruling as the Primary Path to Reversal:** The SG's brief is structured to offer the Court a jurisprudentially conservative \"off-ramp.\" It leads with the argument that the PSJVTA is constitutional even under the modern Fourteenth Amendment framework, urging the Court to decide the case on this narrower ground.\n    *   **Primacy of the *Mallory* Argument:** The brief's first section (Part A) is dedicated to arguing that the PSJVTA's consent-by-conduct mechanism is a valid and \"fair and reasonable\" application of the constructive-consent precedents, most notably *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* The SG argues that if a state can compel consent from a corporation for any lawsuit merely by registering to do business, then Congress can surely compel consent for a narrow category of terrorism-related lawsuits based on specific, forewarned conduct (making \"martyr payments\" or operating in the U.S.).\n    *   **Strategic Phrasing:** The SG explicitly states, \"This Court can decide this case by applying that Fourteenth Amendment standard...\" This is a clear invitation to the Court, particularly institutionalist members like the Chief Justice, to reverse the Second Circuit without issuing a landmark, disruptive ruling on the fundamental nature of personal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **The Broader Originalist Argument is Framed as a Secondary, \"Belt-and-Suspenders\" Rationale:** While the SG fully endorses the argument that the Fifth Amendment provides Congress with broader authority than states have under the Fourteenth, this is presented as a secondary, alternative ground for reversal.\n    *   **\"In Any Event...\" Framing:** The brief presents this argument in Part B under the heading, \"Congress *in any event* has broader authority...\" This framing positions the argument as a backstop: even if the Court is unpersuaded by the *Mallory* analogy, the PSJVTA is *still* constitutional because the federalism-based limits of the Fourteenth Amendment do not constrain Congress in matters of foreign policy and national security.\n    *   **Emphasis on Deference:** This section heavily leans on the idea that the political branches' judgments on foreign policy and national security deserve \"great weight,\" citing cases like *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project* and *Bank Markazi v. Peterson*. This reinforces the separation-of-powers dimension of the case, arguing for judicial restraint.\n\n*   **The Overall Probability of Reversal Has Increased:** By providing two distinct and powerful, government-backed paths to victory, the petitioners' position is significantly strengthened. The respondents cannot simply distinguish *Mallory*; they must now also defeat the powerful argument that the judiciary should defer to Congress's legislative choices in this unique foreign affairs context.\n\n*   **My Predictive Model is Now More Granular:** My uncertainty has shifted from *what* the government would argue to *how* the Court will receive this carefully layered strategy.\n    1.  **The *Mallory* Extension is the Focal Point:** The central question is no longer *if* the *Mallory* argument will be key, but *how* the Court will apply it. The SG's framing makes it the most likely basis for a majority opinion. The key uncertainty is whether the *Mallory* dissenters and concurrer (Justices Barrett, Kagan, Sotomayor, Roberts, and Alito) will find the SG's argument\u2014that the PSJVTA is a *narrower* and thus more permissible use of consent than the statute in *Mallory*\u2014to be persuasive.\n    2.  **The Originalist Argument's Role:** The probability of a sweeping ruling that decouples Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction has decreased as a basis for the *majority opinion*. However, the SG's endorsement makes it a very strong candidate for a concurring opinion from the Court's originalist wing, providing an alternative rationale.\n    3.  **The Next Critical Observation:** The most important missing piece of evidence is now the respondents' merits brief. Their task is now more complex. They must craft a response that not only distinguishes *Mallory* but also provides a compelling reason for the Court to strike down an Act of Congress in an area of foreign policy and national security, directly countering the SG's deference argument.",

For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.  Latching onto the broad provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners in case No. 24-20, who were plaintiffs-\nappellants below, are: Mark I.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents did not accept \u201csome in-forum benefit in \nreturn for an agreement to be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit then denied en banc review.  In \na concurrence to that denial, Judge Bianco (a member \nof the Panel) explained that nothing in the Panel\u2019s \nopinion requires an \u201cexchange of benefits\u201d as the sole \nbasis to infer consent, and that the PSJVTA in any \nevent falls outside the Mallory line of \u201cexchange of \nbenefits\u201d cases.  Id. at 212-15a.  Adopting the new \n\u201cnexus\u201d tests proposed by Petitioners, he explained, \n\u201cwould allow Congress to subject any foreign entity to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, even in the \nabsence of any contacts with the United States, if that \nentity knowingly and voluntary engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute \nconsent.\u201d  Id. at 216a.  This \u201cwould allow the \ngovernment to declare conduct to be consent, even if \n\n8 \n \n \nthat conduct could not reasonably be considered to be \nconsent.\u201d  Id.  \nREASONS TO DENY THE PETITIONS \nI. \nThe decisions below are faithful to Bauxites \nand Mallory.    \nThe Second Circuit scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Bauxites and Mallory.  Applying \nthat precedent, it held that the PSJVTA\u2019s deemed \nconsent provisions fail to create personal jurisdiction \nbecause the activities they specify do not \u201csupport a \nfair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nId. at 26a.  This also followed a unanimous line of \ndecisions holding that Respondents\u2019 actions lack \nsufficient connection to the United States to justify \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction.  Id. at 8-9a; e.g., \nShatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, 1036-37.  The court of \nappeals thus explained that \u201cCongress cannot take \nconduct otherwise insufficient to support an inference \nof consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.  \nThis result flows naturally from established precedent.   \nA. \nConsent to personal jurisdiction must be \nbased \non \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nconduct reflecting legal submission to \njurisdiction. \n \u201cBecause the requirement of personal jurisdiction \nrepresents first of all an individual right, it can, like \nother such rights, be waived.\u201d  Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 \n(1982).  A party may expressly consent to the court\u2019s \njurisdiction, or impliedly consent by \u201csignal[ing]\u201d its \nagreement \u201cthrough actions rather than words.\u201d  Roell \nv. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 589-91 (2003).  Bauxites \ncataloged a \u201cvariety of legal arrangements [that] have \nbeen taken to represent express or implied consent to \n\n9 \n \n \nthe personal jurisdiction of the court,\u201d including \nsubmission \u201cby appearance,\u201d forum-selection clauses, \nstipulation, \u201cconstructive consent\u201d through \u201cthe \nvoluntary use of certain state procedures,\u201d and failure \nto assert a jurisdictional defense.  456 U.S. at 703-04.  \nEach of these \u201clegal arrangements\u201d reflects some \n\u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \u201camount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Id. at 703-\n05.  See Pet. App. 20-21a. \n\u201c[W]hether express or implied,\u201d however, this Court \nhas \u201cemphasiz[ed]\u201d that a party\u2019s consent to \njurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d  \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, \n685 (2015).  An \u201ceffective waiver of a constitutional \nright\u201d generally requires proof of \u201cthe \u2018intentional \nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or \nprivilege.\u2019\u201d  College Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 682 \n(1999).  Because implied or \u201cconstructive\u201d consent \u201cis \nnot a doctrine commonly associated with the \nsurrender of constitutional rights,\u201d federal courts \n\u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 681-82. \nIn \nsome \ncases, \nthe \ncourt \nbelow \nexplained, \ndetermining whether a defendant knowingly and \nvoluntarily consented to personal jurisdiction is \nstraightforward.  Pet. App. 19-20a.  A party may \nexpressly agree to litigate in a particular forum.  Id.  \nCourts may also infer consent to jurisdiction based on \nactions in the litigation itself that demonstrate \nsubmission to jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Roell, 538 U.S. at \n584 (parties who \u201cvoluntarily participated in the \nentire course of proceedings\u201d without objecting to \njurisdiction \u201cclearly implied their consent\u201d \u201cby their \nactions\u201d).  These canonical forms of consent are not at \nissue, however, because Petitioners do not claim that \nRespondents expressly consented, or took any \n\n10 \n \n \nlitigation action evincing submission to jurisdiction.  \nSee Pet. App. 25a. \nAbsent express consent or litigation conduct \nevincing submission to jurisdiction, determining \nwhether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to personal jurisdiction is more difficult.  To \nestablish \nimplied \nconsent, \nPlaintiffs \nmust \ndemonstrate some \u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \n\u201camount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-05.  This is \u201ca deeply \nfactbound analysis\u201d that requires the court to \ndetermine \u201cwhether [defendant\u2019s] actions evinced the \nrequisite knowing and voluntary consent.\u201d  Wellness \nInt\u2019l, 575 U.S. at 685-86.  See Pet. App. 32a.   \nIn \nmaking \nthis \ndetermination, \nthis \nCourt \ndistinguishes \nbetween \ninferring \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nchoice \nto \nsubmit \nto \njurisdiction by its own conduct, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 \nof power\u201d by the forum to impose jurisdiction on \nnonconsenting defendants.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 705.  \nBauxites examined whether the defendant\u2019s failure to \ncomply with court-ordered jurisdictional discovery \ncould be treated as constructive waiver of its objection \nto personal jurisdiction.  Bauxites held that it could, \nbut only because the \u201cpreservation of due process was \nsecured by the presumption\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \nspecific conduct\u2014its \u201cfailure to supply the requested \ninformation as to its contacts with [the forum]\u201d\u2014\u201cwas \nbut an admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d  Id. at 705, 709 (quoting Hammond Packing \nCo. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909)).  By \nrefusing to produce the requested materials, the \ndefendant implicitly acknowledged that it did have \nsufficient contacts with the forum to support personal \njurisdiction.  Id. at 706.  The defendant\u2019s conduct thus \nserved as a constructive waiver of any objection to \njurisdiction.  See id. (\u201c[T]he sanction is nothing more \n\n11 \n \n \nthan the invocation of a legal presumption, or what is \nthe same thing, the finding of a constructive waiver.\u201d); \nPet. App. 32a. \nTo illustrate the \u201cdue process limits\u201d that apply to \nconstructive consent, Bauxites distinguished Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), \u201cin which the Court held \nthat it did violate due process for a court to take \nsimilar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey [a \ncourt] order\u201d unrelated to the asserted defense.  \nBauxites, 456 U.S. at 705-06 (emphasis added).  The \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in that case\u2014failure \u201cto pay into \nthe registry of the court a certain sum of money\u201d\u2014did \nnot support the presumption of a \u201cwant of merit\u201d in its \nasserted defense.  Id.  Subjecting the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction, the Court explained, therefore \nconstituted an improper penalty, rather than a valid \npresumption of constructive waiver drawn from the \ndefendant\u2019s own conduct.  See id. at 706 (\u201cDue process \nis violated only if the behavior of the defendant will \nnot support the Hammond Packing presumption.\u201d).  \nAs the court below explained, this Court also \ndistinguished between valid, implied consent to \njurisdiction \nand \nthe \nimproper \nimposition \nof \njurisdiction in College Savings Bank.  Pet. App. 39-40a.  \nIn that case, plaintiffs argued a state agency waived \nits immunity and \u201cimpliedly\u201d consented to jurisdiction \nby knowingly and voluntarily engaging in interstate \nmarketing after a federal statute stated that such \nactivity would subject it to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at \n671, 676.  Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia \nrejected this \u201cconstructive-waiver\u201d theory based on \nthe difference between a party\u2019s waiver of immunity \nand \n\u201cCongress\u2019s \nexpressing \nunequivocally \nits \nintention that if the State takes certain action it shall \nbe deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d  Id. at 680-\n81.  He emphasized that a voluntary decision to waive \nimmunity was different from being \u201cput on notice that \n\n12 \n \n \nCongress intends to subject\u201d the state to personal \njurisdiction.  Id.  The constitutional requirement of \nconsent would mean nothing if Congress had \u201c[the] \npower to exact constructive waivers\u201d of jurisdictional \ndefenses \u201cthrough the exercise of Article I powers.\u201d  Id. \nat 683.  Merely providing notice of Congress\u2019s intent \nto subject the defendant to jurisdiction if it \n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaged in \u201cfederally regulated conduct\u201d \nwas insufficient to establish a constructive waiver.  Id. \nat 679-82.  See Pet. App. 40-41a.     \nIn describing the circumstances in which plaintiffs \ncould demonstrate implied consent to jurisdiction, \nCollege Savings Bank located valid \u201cconsent\u201d in the \nchoice to accept a government benefit or privilege \nconditioned upon consent.  Congress may \u201ccondition \nits grant of [federal] funds to the States\u201d upon their \nwillingness to consent to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at 686-\n87.  The \u201cacceptance of the funds\u201d by the State would \nsignal its \u201cagreement\u201d to the condition attached.  Id.  \nAccepting this type of \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d conditioned \non consent to jurisdiction, however, presents a \n\u201cfundamentally different\u201d case than the imposition of \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Id.  In the latter case, \n\u201cwhat Congress threatens if the State refuses to agree \nto its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, \nbut a sanction.\u201d  Id.4   \nThis Court has used that same barometer to \nevaluate other implied consent statutes.  Many states, \nfor example, condition the \u201cprivilege\u201d of driving on \npublic roads on consent to personal jurisdiction for \nrelated lawsuits.  Because the state has the \nantecedent authority \u201cto regulate the use of its \n \n4  Although College Savings Bank addressed state sovereign \nimmunity, its analysis was based on broader constitutional \nprinciples as it relied on the \u201cclassic description of an effective \nwaiver of a constitutional right.\u201d  527 U.S. at 681-82. \n\n13 \n \n \nhighways\u201d and to \u201cexclude\u201d non-residents from such \nuse, states may also require non-residents to consent \nto jurisdiction \u201cin advance of the operation of a motor \nvehicle on its highway.\u201d  Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. \n352, 354-57 (1927).  By \u201caccept[ing]\u201d the \u201cprivilege[]\u201d \nof driving on public roads, a non-resident defendant \nimplicitly \u201csignifi[es] \u2026 his agreement,\u201d through his \nconduct, to consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nforum.  Id. \nAs the court of appeals explained, Mallory similarly \nheld that consent may be inferred from a defendant\u2019s \nacceptance of a benefit \u201cwith jurisdictional strings \nattached.\u201d  600 U.S. at 145; Pet. App. 32-33a.  Mallory \nreaffirmed that Bauxites provides the governing \nstandard for implied consent statutes, and requires a \ncourt to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s \u201cactions \u2026 \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of \n[the] court.\u2019\u201d  600 U.S. at 145-46 (plurality op.); id. at \n147-49 (Jackson, J., concurring); id. at 153, 156 (Alito, \nJ., concurring in part); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting) \n(each \nciting \nBauxites). \n \nBusiness \nregistration statutes\u2014under which a corporation \n\u201cconsents\u201d to personal jurisdiction \u201cin exchange \u2018for \naccess to [a State\u2019s] markets\u2019\u201d\u2014are one of the \u201cvariety \nof legal arrangements\u201d that can give rise to valid \nconsent under Bauxites.  Id. at 141 n.8 (emphasis \nadded).  See Pet. App. 32-35a. \nMallory\u2019s discussion of the grounds for inferring \nvalid consent to jurisdiction \u201cunderscores\u201d the \ndifference \u201cbetween the PSJVTA and business \nregistration statutes.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  Unlike a \nbusiness registration statute, the PSJVTA \u201cdoes not \nrequire that the PLO and the PA consent to \njurisdiction as a condition of securing a legal right to \ndo business in the United States, which remains \nprohibited under current law.\u201d  Id.  It also does not \noffer \u201csome in-forum benefit\u201d for Respondents to \n\n14 \n \n \naccept \u201cin return for an agreement to be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Id.  The PSJVTA thus falls \noutside the exchange of benefits cases reaffirmed by \nMallory, which hinge on \u201caccepting an in-[forum] \nbenefit with jurisdictional strings attached.\u201d  600 U.S. \nat 145.  The PSJVTA, on the other hand, relies on \nconduct that courts have repeatedly held cannot \nconstitutionally support personal jurisdiction.  Pet. \nApp. 8-9a.  \nAs College Savings Bank recognized, if the activity \npurportedly giving rise to \u201cconsent\u201d does not require \nauthorization from the forum, the defendant\u2019s choice \nto engage in the activity does not reflect any implied \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction because the \nactivity does not depend on any benefit (or \u201cgratuity\u201d) \nconferred by the forum.  527 U.S. at 680-81.  In such \na case, \u201cthere is little reason to assume actual consent \nbased upon the [defendant\u2019s] mere presence in a field \nsubject to congressional regulation.\u201d  Id.  See Pet. App. \n109a. \nThis does not mean, as the court of appeals was \ncareful to explain, that reciprocity or an exchange of \nbenefits is necessary for knowing and voluntary \nconsent.  Pet. App. 35a n.13, 212-13a.  Consent may \nalso be express, for example, or implied through the \nfailure to comply with procedural rules.  See Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 703-05.  But Petitioners never identified a \nsingle case implying consent to jurisdiction based on a \ndefendant\u2019s choice to engage in non-litigation-related \nactivities in the absence of some benefit or privilege \nconferred upon the defendant in exchange for its \nconsent.  Pet. App. 43a.  As the court below concluded, \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s \u201capproach to deemed consent is \u2018simply \nunheard of.\u201d  Id.   \n \n \n\n15 \n \n \nB. \nRespondents did not knowingly and \nvoluntarily submit to jurisdiction. \nThe court of appeals measured the PSJVTA against \nthose longstanding standards, and unsurprisingly \nheld the statute fails to provide knowing and \nvoluntary consent to personal jurisdiction in this case.  \nRather than identifying conduct that might actually \ndemonstrate implied consent (such as the acceptance \nof U.S. foreign aid or another government benefit), \nCongress \u201csimply declared\u201d that conduct the Second \nand \nD.C. \nCircuits \nhad \nalready \nheld \nwas \nconstitutionally insufficient to support personal \njurisdiction \u201cconstitute[s] \u2018consent\u2019 to jurisdiction.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a.  \u201cNo aspect of these allegedly \njurisdiction-triggering activities can reasonably be \ninterpreted as evincing the defendants\u2019 \u2018intention to \nsubmit\u2019 to the United States courts.\u201d  Id.  Those \nholdings do not warrant this Court\u2019s attention. \n1. Payments made in Palestine do not reflect \nsubmission to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. \nThe \nreasoning \nof \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nis \nstraightforward.  The first type of conduct specified by \nthe PSJVTA\u2014payments made in Palestine to families \nof every person imprisoned or killed in the conflict\u2014\nhas no connection to the United States.  Id. at 26-27a.  \nThe payments at issue occur entirely outside the \nUnited States under a uniform Palestinian law, and \ndo \nnot \nrequire \nauthorization \nfrom \nthe \nU.S. \ngovernment or the involvement of any U.S. entity.  \nThe payments reflect Respondents\u2019 own domestic laws \nand policies, rather than some implicit agreement to \nknowingly and voluntarily submit to jurisdiction in \nthe United States.  Accordingly, under the framework \nset forth in Bauxites, the payments \u201cdo not infer any \nintention on the part of Defendants to legally submit \n\n16 \n \n \nto suit in the United States\u201d\u2014as the lower courts \ncorrectly recognized.  Id. at 74a, 27a. \nPetitioners conflate federal authority to penalize \nextraterritorial conduct (so-called \u201cprescriptive\u201d or \n\u201clegislative\u201d jurisdiction) and federal authority to \nsubject \nnonresident \ndefendants \nto \npersonal \njurisdiction in U.S. courts (so-called \u201cadjudicative\u201d \njurisdiction).  Although Congress may legislate that \nsuch payments can subject a party to liability (or some \nother sanction), that prescriptive authority does not \nanswer the separate constitutional question whether \nRespondents can be forced to adjudicate such claims \nin U.S. courts.  As noted above, courts have already \nheld that the payments fail to establish the \nconstitutionally \nrequisite \n\u201cconnection\u201d \nbetween \nRespondents, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the United States \nto support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.   \nPetitioners suggest that the payments bear a close \n\u201cconnection\u201d to the ATA claims at issue because they \nare made by reason of attacks that injured or killed \nU.S. nationals.  See Gov\u2019t Pet. 17.  That assertion \noverlooks the courts\u2019 consistent holdings that the \nattacks at issue (and thus payments following from \nsuch attacks) did not target the United States, and \n\u201caffected United States citizens only because they \nwere victims of indiscriminate violence that occurred \nabroad.\u201d  Pet. App. 168a.  Because the attacks were \nnot jurisdictionally connected to the United States, \npost-attack payments a fortiori lack a jurisdictional \nnexus. \nThe payments are part of a broader program \ndesigned to provide a \u201csocial safety net in the face of \nbrutal and oppressive living conditions under Israeli \n\n17 \n \n \nmilitary occupation.\u201d5  The PA thus provides welfare \npayments to all families of Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled for political crimes and security offenses\u2014broad \nlegislation that recognizes that 70% of Palestinian \nfamilies have at least one relative detained by Israel.6  \nTens of thousands of prisoners and families receive \nthe monthly payments.\n7   Given this context, \nportraying these payments as intended to incentivize \nterrorism is \u201cwrong and incendiary.\u201d8   \n2. Petitioners failed to argue U.S. activities \nthat could create jurisdiction, and then \nwaived the argument on appeal. \nThe court of appeals did not decide whether the \nPSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities predicate was met, or if facts \nmight someday exist that could justify jurisdiction.  \nThough Respondents created a significant factual \nrecord on that predicate before the trial courts, \nPetitioners made only fleeting references to that \nrecord on appeal.  Petitioners\u2019 claim that the issue was \n\u201cuncontested\u201d \nbelow \nis \nseriously \nwrong \nand \nmisleading.  Pl.

Doc. \n1064 at 12-14 (summarizing evidence).  In the end, the \ncourts did not decide if the U.S. activities prong was \ntriggered.  Pet. App. 15a n.4, 67-68a.  But they did \nhold that even the U.S. activities as alleged were \u201ctoo \nthin to support a meaningful inference of consent to \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 108a, 74a. \nb.  Before the court of appeals, Petitioners\u2019 opening \nbriefs did not meaningfully delve into the facts \nregarding the U.S. activities.  To the contrary, \n \n9 Plaintiffs argued Respondents\u2019 UN mission would trigger the \nPSJVTA if its social media posts constituted \u201cpropaganda.\u201d  That \nposition would render the statute unconstitutionally vague. \n\n19 \n \n \nPlaintiffs expressly requested that the court of \nappeals not decide the U.S. activities issue.  See \nSokolow C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 542 at 35 n.3 (asking \ncourt of appeals not to decide second factual predicate); \nFuld C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 161 at 26 n.7 (same).  The \nGovernment, for its part, did not dispute that the UN \nmission was Respondents\u2019 only office in the United \nStates.  Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 73 at 7.  It also took \n\u201cno position on whether any of the statute\u2019s factual \npredicates have been satisfied.\u201d  Fuld D.Ct. Doc. 53 at \n8 n.5.  Respondents, on appeal, affirmed they had no \n\u201cphysical presence\u201d in the U.S. other than their UN \nmission and did not engage in any \u201cnon-UN-related \nactivities in the United States.\u201d  Fuld C.A. Def. Br. \nDoc. 148 at 23 n.2, 46-47, 48 n.19.  Respondents noted \ntheir arguments about the UN mission\u2019s activities in \nthe trial court.  Id. at 48 n.20.   \nGiven that Petitioners asked it not to decide the U.S. \nactivities \nquestion, \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nunsurprisingly found it \u201cunnecessary to address that \nquestion on this appeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (Fuld); id. at \n68a (Sokolow).  The court of appeals instead explained \nthat Respondents are \u201cprohibited\u201d from operating in \nthe United States.  Id. at 28-29a.  And that \u201cUN-\nrelated conduct and offices \u2026 are protected pursuant \nto international treaty\u201d and, \u201cas set forth in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3), are exempt from the PSJVTA\u2019s second \nprong.\u201d  Id.  Nor could the PSJVTA be read as \nconferring a benefit, in any case, \u201cbecause the \ndefendants have not been granted permission to \nengage in th[e] [prohibited] activities at all.\u201d  Id.  The \ncourt of appeals made clear that any such permission \nwould have to be granted \u201cformal[ly]\u201d (id. at n.9), \nbelying the Government\u2019s argument that the \u201ccourt \ndid not offer a defense of its premise that the \ngovernment must affirmatively permit the relevant \nactivity through the PSJVTA itself or another statute.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \n \nGov\u2019t Pet. 21.  For those reasons, the \u201csecond prong of \nthe PSJVTA similarly specifies predicate conduct that \ndoes not evince the defendants\u2019 agreement to subject \nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the United States \ncourts.\u201d  Pet. App. 27a.  \n This \nCourt \nshould \nnot \nconsider \nwhether \nRespondents triggered the U.S. activities prong as a \nmatter of first impression.  See CRST Van Expedited, \nInc. v. EEOC, 578 U.S. 419, 435 (2016) (\u201cIt is not the \nCourt\u2019s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or \npredicate factual questions in the first instance.\u201d).  \n3. Unlike the ATCA, the PSJVTA does not \nrely on benefits conditioned on consent. \nThe PSJVTA\u2019s failure to establish valid, implied \nconsent to jurisdiction is well-illustrated by the \ncontrast with its predecessor statute, the ATCA.  The \nATCA provided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they \naccepted either of two government benefits: (1) U.S. \nforeign aid, or (2) the \u201cbenefit[]\u201d of a formal \u201cwaiver or \nsuspension\u201d of the prohibitions on their activities \nunder the 1987 ATA.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018). \nRegarding the ATCA, the Government argued that \nbecause \u201cthe political branches have long imposed \nconditions on these benefits,\u201d it was \u201creasonable and \nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment\u201d for Congress \n\u201cto determine that the [PLO\u2019s] maintenance of an \noffice in this country after a waiver \u2026, or the [PA\u2019s] \ncontinued receipt of certain foreign assistance, should \nbe \u2018deemed\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d  U.S. \nBrief 12-13, Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 13, 2019) (emphasis added).  The \nATCA satisfied due process, in other words, because it \ngrounded \u201cdeemed consent\u201d on Respondents\u2019 choice to \naccept or reject benefits conditioned upon consent.  \nBoth the Second and D.C. Circuits held that the ATCA \n\n21 \n \n \ndid \nnot \ncreate \npersonal \njurisdiction \nbecause \nRespondents elected not to accept either benefit.  Pet. \nApp. 10-11a; Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1128-31.   \nThe PSJVTA, by contrast, does not confer any \nbenefit on Respondents in exchange for their \npurported \u201cconsent.\u201d  It does not authorize them to \nengage in activities in the United States prohibited by \nthe 1987 ATA and similar statutes, and does not \nextend any government benefit (e.g., foreign aid) \nconditioned upon consent to personal jurisdiction.10  \nNor have Respondents received any benefit because \nthe PSJVTA does not alter preexisting prohibitions on \ntheir U.S. activities.  The court of appeals expressly \nleft undecided whether the PSJVTA could be \nconstitutional \u201cunder different circumstances\u201d (for \nexample, if Respondents began non-UN operations in \nthe United States).  Pet. App. 38a; id. at 27-29a.  But \nthat is a benefit not presently offered by the United \nStates to Respondents.  \nII.   The petitions fail to raise any circuit split or \nissue of exceptional importance.  \nThe petitions in this case are exceptional only in \nthat no court has ever agreed with the positions they \nespouse.  The lower courts are unanimous in holding \nthe PSJVTA is unconstitutional in these cases.  They \nare equally unanimous in rejecting Petitioners\u2019 \narguments that the Fifth Amendment presents \nfundamentally different protections to individual \nliberty than the Fourteenth.  Nor do these petitions \n \n10 Various statutes prohibit Respondents from operating in the \nU.S., including the 1987 ATA, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 (barring the PLO \nand, now, its successor-in-part, the PA, from maintaining an \noffice or expending funds in the U.S.), and the 2006 ATA, \u00a7 7(a), \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378b note (making it \u201cunlawful\u201d to operate \u201cat the \nbehest or direction of, or with funds provided by, the Palestinian \nAuthority\u201d).  See Pet. App. 28a n.9. \n\n22 \n \n \npresent matters hampering U.S. antiterrorism efforts.  \nNor is the PSJVTA of broad applicability\u2014it only \napplies to two sui generis entities for which the federal \ncourts repeatedly rejected jurisdiction.   \nA. \nThe petitions raise no split in authority \nor disagreement between the circuits. \n1.  Every court to reach the issue agrees the \nPSJVTA does not create consent to jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs in three New York cases used the PSJVTA \nto claim personal jurisdiction.  The trial courts \nunanimously found that satisfaction of the statute\u2019s \nfactual predicates did not demonstrate consent to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 94a, 80a, 71a; Shatsky, \n2022 WL 826409, *4-5.  A Colorado district court \nagreed, finding \u201cthat Congress cannot simply legislate \nthat \u2018any conduct, without regard for its connections \nto the United States generally \u2026 signals a party\u2019s \nintent to submit to the jurisdiction of a United States \ncourt.\u2019\u201d  Levine, 688 F. Supp. 3d at 1010.  The Second \nCircuit agreed.  Pet. App. 38a, 69-70a. \nIn addition to unanimity on the PSJVTA, federal \ncourts agree on the standards for jurisdictional due \nprocess under the Fifth Amendment.  Every circuit to \nreach the issue agrees that the minimum contacts and \nconsent standards developed under the Fourteenth \nAmendment apply under the Fifth Amendment.  See \nPet. App. 49-51a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54-56; Douglass \nv. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 \n(5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cBoth Due Process Clauses \nuse the same language and serve the same purpose, \nprotecting individual liberty by guaranteeing limits \non personal jurisdiction.  Every court that has \nconsidered this point agrees that the standards mirror \neach other.\u201d); id. at 238 n.22 (collecting cases from \nvarious circuits); Herederos De Roberto Gomez \nCabrera v. Teck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th \n\n23 \n \n \nCir. 2022) (\u201cthe operative language of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments is materially identical, and \nit would be incongruous for the same words to \ngenerate markedly different doctrinal analyses\u201d).  \u201cTo \nsuppose that \u2018due process of law\u2019 meant one thing in \nthe Fifth Amendment and another in the Fourteenth \nis too frivolous to require elaborate rejection.\u201d  \nMalinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 415 (1945) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring). \nNot one case supports Petitioners\u2019 views that the \ndue process standards should be abandoned or relaxed \nunder the Fifth Amendment.  See Pet. App. 45-46a.  \nCourts \nhave \nlong \nrejected \nthe \nnotion \n\u201cthat \nfederalism\u2019s irrelevance in the Fifth Amendment \ncontext justifies a \u2018more lenient\u2019 standard for personal \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 48a; Douglass, 46 F.4th at 239 \nn.24 (collecting cases from various circuits). \n2.  Petitioners do not defend the PSJVTA on the \nbasis of consent\u2014even though the statutory language \ndepends exclusively on \u201cconsent.\u201d  Instead, Petitioners \nask this Court to opine broadly on Congress\u2019s power to \nimpose jurisdiction on Respondents. \nPetitioners give no more than lip service to the \nconcept of consent, and instead focus on whether \nCongress can legislatively impose jurisdiction on \nRespondents if they do not comply with Congress\u2019s \ndemands.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 17-19; Pl. Pet. 23-25.  They ask \nonly if it is \u201cfair\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d to \u201cassert\u201d personal \njurisdiction over Respondents.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 20-22; Pl. \nPet. 20, 24, 26.  The amici are similarly adamant in \nasking this Court to decide that question, rather than \naddressing consent.  Grassley Amicus Br. 17; House \nAmicus Br. 11; Sofaer Amicus Br. 3.  But that is not \nthe question presented by the PSJVTA, which is \nwhether Respondents can be constitutionally deemed \nto have consented to jurisdiction.  This Court should \n\n24 \n \n \nnot accept certiorari to decide if Congress has powers \nit did not purport to exercise.   \nThe court of appeals correctly considered the statute \non its own terms\u2014and through this Court\u2019s consent \ncases\u2014cases that Petitioners largely disregard.  \nPetitioners, instead, rely on minimum contacts cases \nlike Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 139 (2014), \nand Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, \n471-72 (1985).  Their reliance on hornbook minimum \ncontacts cases to establish the standard applicable to \nconsent \nunder \nthe \nPSJVTA \nhighlights \nthe \ninconsistency at the heart of their petitions.   \nPetitioners\u2019 theories also undermine this Court\u2019s \ndue process cases.  If Petitioners are correct, Congress \ncould circumvent those cases by enacting statutes \ndeclaring that the same activities already held \nconstitutionally insufficient to confer jurisdiction \nshall be deemed as consent.  Under Daimler, for \nexample, a California court could not exercise \njurisdiction over a foreign car manufacturer and its \nU.S. subsidiary, which distributed vehicles to \nCalifornia dealerships, but were incorporated and \nmaintained their principal places of business \nelsewhere.  571 U.S. at 139.  Despite achieving \n\u201csizable\u201d sales in the state, the Court held that \ndefendants\u2019 activities were insufficient for general \njurisdiction because they were not \u201cessentially at \nhome\u201d in the forum.  Id.  Under Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, \nCongress could declare that any foreign corporation \nthat distributed vehicles to California dealerships \n\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d in the state.   \n \n \n\n25 \n \n \nB. \nThe petitions fail to raise an issue of \nexceptional practical importance.   \nNot only do the decisions below have no legal \nimportance except to the parties, they also have no \nbroader practical importance.  The PSJVTA does not \napply to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State, or any \nother terrorist groups or state-sponsors of terrorism.  \nAs the Government concedes, the decisions apply only \nto two sui generis entities over which the courts have \nrepeatedly rejected personal jurisdiction.  The facts in \nthese cases also do not raise uniquely American \nconcerns.  Respondents are not headquartered here, \nand the attacks at issue were random attacks, not \naimed at Americans.   \nAs the Solicitor General explained earlier in this \ncase, \u201cnothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants \nunder the broader due process principles the courts \nhave recognized in cases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Resp. App. 24a.  The ATA still \u201cpermits \nU.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants \naccused of targeting U.S. citizens in an act of \ninternational terrorism\u201d or where \u201cthe United States \nwas the focal point of the harm caused by the \ndefendant\u2019s participation in or support for overseas \nterrorism.\u201d  Id.  The ATA also applies to defendants \n\u201cconducting activity in the United States, by, for \nexample, making use of U.S. financial institutions to \nsupport international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  The opinions \nbelow do not affect \u201ccases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Id.  In sum, ATA jurisdiction is present \nwhere attacks are targeted at America or U.S. citizens, \nor are planned or financed in the United States.  \n\n26 \n \n \nThe political branches have a robust arsenal of \nantiterrorism tools unconstrained by the decisions \nbelow, including criminal prosecutions, sanctions, \nasset freezes, export controls, and the use of force.  \nCongress has recognized that ATA criminal cases \nmore directly advance the government\u2019s interests in \nantiterrorism law enforcement than their civil \ncounterparts.  See 138 Cong. Rec. S17254-01, S17260, \n1992 \nWL \n308152 \n(daily \ned. \nOct. \n7, \n1992); \nAntiterrorism Act of 1990: Hearing on S. 2465 Before \nthe S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 46-47 \n(1990).  As such, \u201cadher[ence] to the status quo of \npersonal jurisdiction doctrine\u201d in civil ATA cases \n\u201cdo[es] not diminish any law-enforcement tools that \ncurrently exist.\u201d  Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  \nNor does the result below prevent Plaintiffs from \nbringing suit in an appropriate forum.  Israeli courts \nallow suits by Americans who are injured in Israel.  A \ncourt recently awarded damages against Respondents \nto two Americans injured in a 1985 PLF attack. 11  \nIsrael also allows large damage awards, including a \n$100 million award against Respondents for injuries \nduring the Second Intifada.12  Another Israeli court \nfound Respondents liable for welfare payments in \n \n11 JNS Wire, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to Achille Lauro \nHijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), https://www.jns.org/wire/plo-\nordered-to-pay-compensation-to-achille-lauro-hijacking-\nvictims/; Shurat Hadin, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to \n1985 Achille Lauro Hijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), \nhttps://israellawcenter.org/legal_actions/plo-ordered-to-pay-\ncompensation-to-1985-achille-lauro-hijacking-vicitms/.  \n12 Jerusalem Post, Terror victims\u2019 families to collect NIS 500 m. \nfrom Palestinian Authority (Apr. 26, 2020), https://www. \njpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/court-orders-collection-of-nis-500-\nm-from-pa-for-second-intifada-625930; \nNorz\u2019its \nLitbac \nv. \nPalestinian Auth.

This case is a poor vehicle to resolve the \nconstitutionality of the PSJVTA.  \nBoth Fuld and Sokolow have significant issues \npreventing this Court from providing the relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  Among other things, Petitioners\u2019 \nhands are tied by estoppel, waiver, and forfeiture.  As \na result, these cases are poor vehicles, especially since \nthe Court will have future opportunities to address \nthe PSJVTA in cases currently pending in other \ncircuits. \nA. \nThese cases face unique case-specific \nchallenges.   \n1.  The Fuld plaintiffs are estopped from obtaining \nrelief.  They pursued various defendants on \ninconsistent theories, claiming each was responsible \nfor the same attack.  But they recently secured a $191 \nmillion judgment on the basis that Iran and Syria \naided Hamas, which was \u201cthe terror organization that \ncarried out the attack.\u201d  Fuld v. Islamic Republic of \nIran, No. 20-2444, 2024 WL 1328790, *1, *4 (D.D.C. \nMar. 28, 2024).  The court accepted plaintiffs\u2019 position, \nholding the attacker was \u201crecruited to Hamas through \nhis high school,\u201d and the attack \u201cwas planned and \n \n13 Times of Israel, High Court: PA liable for terrorism due to \nmoney it pays attackers; victims can sue (Apr. 10, 2022), \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-pa-liable-for-\nterrorism-due-to-stipends-to-attackers-victims-can-sue/; \nAnon. \nv. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivA 2362/19 (Jerusalem 2022); \nMentin v. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivC 3361/09 (Jerusalem \n2017). \n \n\n28 \n \n \ncarried out by the Al-Qassam Brigades\u2014the Hamas \nterrorist branch.\u201d  Id. at *4-6. \nThe plaintiffs also convinced the court that the \nattack was a stroke against Respondents\u2019 legitimacy, \nintended to mark \u201cthe 15th anniversary of the Oslo \nAccords\u2014an agreement Hamas seeks to eradicate.\u201d  \nId. at *5.  Respondents are the enemies and \u201cbitter \nrivals\u201d of Hamas, id. at *4, and were recognized or \nestablished by the Oslo Accords.  The attack, plaintiffs \nclaimed, was \u201cintended to protest against the security \ncooperation between Israel and Fatah and the \nPalestinian Authority.\u201d  Fuld v. Iran Doc. 27-3 at 50. \nGiven that successful position and resulting \njudgment, it would be illogical and inconsistent for \nPlaintiffs to also claim that Respondents were \nactually responsible for the attack.  New Hampshire v. \nMaine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (estoppel prohibits \n\u201cparties \nfrom \ndeliberately \nchanging \npositions \naccording to the exigencies of the moment\u201d). \n2.  Sokolow is also a poor vehicle.  Filed in 2004, it \nwent through discovery and a jury verdict, but was \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction in 2016.  \nAfter it became final, the Sokolow plaintiffs asked the \ncourt of appeals to recall its mandate.  The court, \nhowever, held in 2019 that its \u201cinterest in finality ... \nweighs against recalling the mandate.\u201d  Pet. App. 132-\n35a. \u201cRecalling the mandate now would offend \u2018the \nneed to preserve finality in judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nIt noted the plaintiffs had another case that would be \nthe appropriate forum for litigating the PSJVTA.  Id. \nat 135a n.2.  More time has passed, and Sokolow has \nnow been final for eight years. \nBut even if Sokolow is resurrected, its jury verdict \ncannot be.  As explained in Burnham v. Superior Ct. \nof California, 495 U.S. 604, 608-09 (1990), the limited \nnature of the judicial power means that \u201cthe judgment \n\n29 \n \n \nof a court lacking jurisdiction is void.\u201d  Both \n\u201cproceedings\u201d \nand \n\u201cjudgments\u201d \nmade \nwithout \npersonal jurisdiction are \u201cnot simply erroneous, but \nabsolutely void.\u201d  Roman Cath. Archdiocese of San \nJuan v. Feliciano, 589 U.S. 57, 64 (2020) (cleaned up).  \nAnd even if this case were to survive, there are still \nissues remaining from the original appeal, including \nimproper expert testimony.  Pet. App. 141-42a; see \nGilmore v. Palestinian Auth., 843 F.3d 958, 972-73 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (affirming judgment for Respondents \nafter excluding one such expert\u2019s testimony).   \n3.  This Court will have multiple chances to accept \ncertiorari \nin \nthe future, \nbenefiting from \nthe \nperspectives of other circuits.  The Tenth Circuit case \nmentioned above is currently set for oral argument on \nNovember 19, 2024 (Nos. 23-1286, 23-1335), and \nanother PSJVTA case is pending in D.C. district court \n(No. 04-1173).    \nB. \nEver-changing theories of due process \nand original meaning create waiver \nproblems.  \nThe Petitioners also cannot avoid the results of their \nprior inconsistent positions.  Plaintiffs have forfeited \ntheir originalism arguments, and the Government \nproposes a new and different due process theory \nbefore this Court.  Plaintiffs\u2019 forfeited originalism \narguments remain, as might be expected, slapdash, \nunder-developed, and unready for this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments about due process and \noriginal meaning were forfeited.  They did not raise \narguments about the original understanding at the \ntrial court level in either Fuld or Sokolow.  On appeal, \nonly the Fuld plaintiffs raised originalism, and they \ndid so only to argue for a \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cnexus\u201d standard \nunder the Fifth Amendment\u2014not the extreme due-\nprocess-does-not-include-jurisdiction approach found \n\n30 \n \n \nfor the first time in their petition.  See Fuld C.A. Pl. \nBr. Doc. 67 at 49, 61.  The Second Circuit, not \nsurprisingly given the forfeiture, did not address \noriginalism.  \nThis Court should decline to review Plaintiffs\u2019 new \noriginalism argument as it was doubly forfeited.  See \nOBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 \n(2015) (\u201c[t]hat argument was never presented to any \nlower court and is therefore forfeited\u201d); Adams v. \nRobertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86 (1997) (dismissing \ncertiorari as improvidently granted when petitioners \nfailed the \u201cburden of showing that the issue was \nproperly presented\u201d below). \nThe Government has also significantly changed its \nposition on due process.  It successfully argued for the \nestablished \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d standard in both \ntrial and appellate courts.  See Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. \n73 at 21; Sokolow C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 447 at 19.  Only \nafter losing under that very same standard did the \nGovernment begin to argue for the new fairness-only \napproach found in its Petition, where consent is just \none of the \u201cconsiderations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 16, 21.  Below, \nthe Government argued for clear distinctions between \nconsent jurisdiction and imposed jurisdiction.  Fuld \nC.A. Gov\u2019t Reply Doc. 162 at 5.  Here, for the first time, \nthe Government proposes to replace longstanding due \nprocess standards for consent jurisdiction with the \n\u201cflexible\u201d \nbut \nentirely \ndifferent \nstandards \nfor \nprocedural due process.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 14, 20.   \n2.  The need for further development of Plaintiffs\u2019 \noriginalism arguments is reflected in the many errors \nin their petition.  Plaintiffs cite the Constitution\u2019s \nexpress grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction in \nadmiralty and maritime cases as evidence of \n\u201cextraterritorial power\u201d being a \u201cdeliberate feature of \nthe constitutional plan.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 16-17.  It is precisely \n\n31 \n \n \nthe opposite; the Constitution expressly confers \nextraterritorial jurisdiction in limited cases to the \nexclusion of others.  See The Federalist No. 80 (federal \njurisdiction extends to cases that \u201coriginate on the \nhigh seas, and are of admiralty or maritime \njurisdiction\u201d); Constit., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 10; Art. III, \nSec. 2, cl. 1.  Had the Framers understood federal \njurisdiction to be unconstrained by national borders \nas Plaintiffs contend, these explicit provisions of \njurisdiction would be superfluous.   \nAccordingly, early scholars believed federal courts\u2019 \njurisdiction was circumscribed by \u201ca sovereign\u2019s power \n[which] was limited to activities occurring within its \nterritory.\u201d  Lea Brilmayer & Charles Norchi, Federal \nExtraterritoriality and Fifth Amendment Due Process, \n105 Harv. L. Rev. 1217, 1224-25 (1992); Joseph Story, \nCommentaries on the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 539 (1834) \n(\u201c[J]urisdiction, to be rightfully exercised, must be \nfounded either upon the person being within the \nterritory, or the thing being within the territory; for, \notherwise, there can be no sovereignty exerted.\u201d).  \nIndeed, \u201cleading writers on international law who \ninformed the Framers\u2019 views ... regarded universal \njurisdiction as aberrational or problematic.\u201d  Eugene \nKontorovich, The \u2018Define And Punish\u2019 Clause And The \nLimits Of Universal Jurisdiction, 103 Nw. U.L. Rev. \n149, 174 (2009).   \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, this Court has \ncontinually acknowledged limits on jurisdiction over \nforeign persons.  As early as 1808, Chief Justice \nMarshall recognized that \u201cthe legislation of every \ncountry is territorial; that beyond its own territory, it \ncan only affect its own subjects or citizens.\u201d  Rose v. \nHimely, 8 U.S. 241, 279 (1808); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 \nU.S. 264, 295 (1821) (\u201clegislative power has no \noperation, beyond the territorial limits under its \nauthority\u201d); see also Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, \n\n32 \n \n \n611-12 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (\u201c[N]o sovereignty can \nextend its process beyond its territorial limits, to \nsubject either persons or property to its judicial \ndecisions.\u201d).   \n\u201cThe jurisdiction of courts is a branch of that which \nis possessed by the nation as an independent \nsovereign power\u201d and that sovereignty is \u201cincapable of \nconferring extra-territorial power.\u201d  The Schooner \nExch. v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 136-37 (1812); The \nApollon, 22 U.S. 362, 370 (1824) (\u201cThe laws of no \nnation can justly extend beyond its own territories, \u2026 \nhowever general and comprehensive the phrases used \nin our municipal laws may be, they must always be \nrestricted in construction, to places and persons, upon \nwhom \nthe \nLegislature \nhave \nauthority \nand \njurisdiction.\u201d).  \nGuided by an academic, Plaintiffs erroneously \nclaim Justice Story held that \u201cthe federal courts\u201d \nwould be \u201cbound to follow\u201d any statute imposing \njurisdiction on anyone \u201cfrom the other end of the \nglobe.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 15, 19 (quoting Picquet).  But \u201c[e]ven \nunder the act of Congress, judgments must appear to \nbe rendered by courts having jurisdiction of the \nparties, as well as the cause.\u201d  Aspden v. Nixon, 45 \nU.S. 467, 484 (1846).  Picquet is not to the contrary, as \nit addressed Congress\u2019s power to allow a court to \nattach and execute on property within its territorial \njurisdiction.  19 F. Cas. at 615.  Picquet, in fact, \nrepeatedly warns that jurisdiction could not extend \noutside national boundaries.  Id. at 611 (\u201cEven the \ncourt of king\u2019s bench in England, though a court of \ngeneral jurisdiction, never imagined, that it could \nserve process in Scotland, Ireland, or the colonies, to \ncompel an appearance, or justify a judgment against \npersons residing therein at the time of the \ncommencement of the suit.\u201d).  \n\n33 \n \n \nPlaintiffs\u2019 loose approach to the Constitution and \nhistory underscores the need for further consideration \nof these issues in the lower courts.   \n \nC. \nPetitioners fail to address separation of \npowers.   \nThough these cases were resolved on due process \ngrounds, Respondents raised separation of powers at \nevery stage.  Petitioners fail to address this significant \nconstitutional roadblock.   \nCongress overstepped its constitutional authority \nwith the PSJVTA by attempting to \u201cusurp a court\u2019s \npower to interpret and apply the law to the \ncircumstances before it.\u201d  Bank Markazi v. Peterson, \n578 U.S. 212, 224-28 (2016) (cleaned up); United \nStates v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128, 147 (1871) (overturning \nstatute \nrequiring \ncourts \nto \ntreat \npardons \nof \nConfederate sympathizers as conclusive evidence of \ndisloyalty).  The PSJVTA usurps the judicial function \nby directing courts to always find consent if its factual \npredicates \nare \nmet\u2014regardless \nof \nwhether \nconstitutional standards for consent are satisfied.  \nDetermining the waiver of constitutional rights is a \nquintessentially \njudicial \nquestion, \nrequiring \n\u201capplication of constitutional principles to the facts as \nfound.\u201d  Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977).  \nThat is particularly so when consent to jurisdiction \nrequires a \u201cdeeply factbound analysis.\u201d  Wellness Int\u2019l, \n575 U.S. at 685-86. \nThe PSJVTA also violates the principle that \nCongress cannot \u201clegislatively supersede\u201d decisions \n\u201cinterpreting \nand \napplying \nthe \nConstitution.\u201d  \nDickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 437 (2000).  \nThe Second and D.C. Circuits previously held that \nfinding personal jurisdiction based on the same course \n\n34 \n \n \nof conduct alleged here violates due process.  \nPermitting Congress to supersede those holdings by \nre-labeling that conduct as \u201cconsent\u201d would violate \nseparation of powers.  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 \nU.S. 507, 523-24 (1997) (rejecting Congressional effort \nto overturn precedent by creating a different \nconstitutional standard).  As one judge explained, \nCongress cannot take \u201cconduct that the Second and \nD.C. Circuits had held was insufficient to support \npersonal jurisdiction \u2026 and declare[] that such \nconduct \u2018shall be deemed\u2019 to be consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.  Pet.

In the view of the United States, \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a.  Petitioners are United States citizens, and the \nguardians, family members, and personal representa-\ntives of the estates of United States citizens, who were \ninjured or killed in seven terrorist attacks in or near Je-\nrusalem.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  In 2004, petitioners filed suit \nagainst respondents Palestinian Authority (PA) and \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA), which provides a \nright of action to United States nationals and their es-\ntates, survivors, or heirs for injuries caused by acts of \n7a\n                     (1)\n\n2 \n \ninternational terrorism. 18 U.S.C. 2333(a).  Respond-\nents moved to dismiss the claims for lack of personal ju-\nrisdiction.  See Pet. App. 5a.   \nThe district court denied respondents\u2019 motion, hold-\ning that it had general jurisdiction over respondents.  \nPet. App. 52a-74a.  The court framed the jurisdictional \ninquiry as \u201cwhether a defendant has minimum contacts \nwith the forum\u201d sufficient to justify maintenance of the \nsuit and \u201cwhether it would be reasonable, under the cir-\ncumstances of the particular case, to exercise jurisdic-\ntion over the defendant.\u201d  Id. at 60a.  The court reasoned \nthat respondents\u2019 \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d pres-\nence in the United States was sufficient to support gen-\neral jurisdiction, and that respondents could therefore \nbe sued in the United States on all claims, regardless of \nwhether the claims concerned respondents\u2019 conduct \nwithin the United States.  Id. at 61a.  The court empha-\nsized that respondents \u201cpurposely engaged in numer-\nous activities\u201d here, including commercial and public-\nrelations activities, and that respondents maintained an \noffice in Washington, D.C.  Id. at 62a; see id. at 63a-65a.  \nThe court also concluded that exercising personal juris-\ndiction over respondents was reasonable in light of \u201ctra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  Id. \nat 72a (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nRespondents moved for reconsideration after this \nCourt \u201csignificantly narrowed the general personal ju-\nrisdiction test in [Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. \n746 (2014)].\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  The district court denied \nthe motion.  Id. at 75a-81a.  The court stated that re-\nspondents were effectively \u201cat home in the United \nStates\u201d because their activities here were \u201ccontinuous \nand systematic.\u201d  Id. at 77a.  And the court stated that \nit did not have \u201cany basis to believe\u201d that respondents \n8a\n\n3 \n \nwere engaged in more continuous or systematic activi-\nties in any other country.  Id. at 77a.  Respondents \nraised their jurisdictional arguments again in seeking \nsummary judgment.  Ibid. The court denied that mo-\ntion, rejecting respondents\u2019 argument that their con-\ntacts with the United States were insufficient to support \ngeneral jurisdiction under Daimler.  Id. at 82a-87a.   \nb. The district court permitted claims concerning six \nterrorist attacks to proceed to a jury trial.  Pet. App. 9a \nn.4.  Petitioners presented evidence linking respond-\nents to each of the attacks, id. at 9a-11a, 35a-36a, but \n\u201cdid not allege or submit evidence that [petitioners or \ntheir decedents] were targeted in any of the six attacks \nat issue because of their United States citizenship or \nthat [respondents] engaged in conduct in the United \nStates related to the attacks,\u201d id. at 15a.   \nThe jury found respondents civilly liable for the six \nattacks under several theories.  It concluded that, for all \nof the attacks, respondents had provided material sup-\nport or resources.  Pet. App. 35a.  It also concluded that, \nfor five of the attacks, respondents were responsible \nbased on respondeat-superior principles because a PA \npolice officer or other PA employee had either carried \nout the attack or provided material support or re-\nsources for the attack.  Ibid.  The jury further concluded \nthat, in connection with three of the attacks, respond-\nents knowingly provided material support to organiza-\ntions designated by the State Department as foreign \nterrorist organizations, and members of those organiza-\ntions carried out the attacks.  Id. at 36a.  Finally, the \njury concluded for one of the attacks that respondents \nhad harbored or concealed a person that they knew or \nhad reasonable grounds to believe was involved with the \nattacks.  Ibid.  The jury awarded petitioners damages \n9a\n\n4 \n \nof $218.5 million, which were increased to $655.5 million \nunder the ATA\u2019s treble-damages provision.  Id. at 6a; \nsee 18 U.S.C. 2333(a). \n2. The court of appeals vacated and remanded the \ncase to the district court with instructions to dismiss pe-\ntitioners\u2019 suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. \n1a-51a.   \nAs an initial matter, the court of appeals rejected pe-\ntitioners\u2019 argument that respondents have no due pro-\ncess rights because respondents \u201care foreign govern-\nments and share many of the attributes typically asso-\nciated with a sovereign government.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see \nid. at 19a-20a.  The court acknowledged that it had held \nthat \u201c[f\u200a]oreign sovereign states do not have due process \nrights,\u201d and instead enjoy the protections against suit \nafforded by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of \n1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1602 et seq.  Pet. App. 19a (citing \nFrontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the \nAzerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 398-401 (2d Cir. \n2009)).  But the court explained that \u201cneither the PLO \nnor the PA is recognized by the United States as a sov-\nereign state, and the executive\u2019s determination of such \nmatter is conclusive.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citing Zivotofsky v. \nKerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2088 (2015)).  The court noted \nthat petitioners had pointed to no decision \u201cindicating \nthat a non-sovereign entity with governmental attrib-\nutes lacks due process rights.\u201d  Id. at 19a-20a. \nThe court of appeals next turned to whether the ex-\nercise of personal jurisdiction over respondents was \nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  In analyzing that question, the court re-\njected petitioners\u2019 argument that the principles of gen-\neral and specific jurisdiction developed in the context of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause were \n10a\n\n5 \n \ninapplicable because the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cis \ngrounded in concepts of federalism [and] was intended \nto referee jurisdictional conflicts among the sovereign \nStates.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court explained that its \n\u201cprecedents clearly establish the congruence of due \nprocess analysis under both the Fourteenth and Fifth \nAmendments.\u201d  Id. at 22a.  The \u201cprincipal difference,\u201d \nthe court further explained, \u201cis that under the Fifth \nAmendment the court can consider the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts throughout the United States, while under the \nFourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the fo-\nrum state may be considered.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that it \u201cha[d] already applied Four-\nteenth Amendment principles to Fifth Amendment civil \nterrorism cases,\u201d among others.  Id. at 22a-23a (citing \nIn re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, \n673-674 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S.

Pet. App. 25a-32a.  It explained that \u201c[a] \ncourt may assert general personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant to hear any and all claims against that \ndefendant only when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with \nthe State in which suit is brought \u2018are so constant and \npervasive as to render [it] essentially at home in the fo-\nrum State.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at 24a (internal quotation marks omit-\nted; brackets in original) (quoting Daimler, 134  \nS. Ct. at 751).  The court concluded that \u201coverwhelming \nevidence\u201d showed that respondents were at home in the \n11a\n\n6 \n \nWest Bank and in Gaza.  Id. at 27a.  In contrast, re-\nspondents\u2019 activities in the United States were more \nlimited and resembled \u201cthose rejected as insufficient by \nthe Supreme Court in Daimler.\u201d  Id. at 28a. \nThe court of appeals also found respondents\u2019 con-\ntacts with the United States insufficient for purposes of \nspecific jurisdiction\u2014a question that petitioners had in-\nvited the court to address even though the district court \nhad not decided that issue.  Pet. App. 32a-50a; see Pet. \nC.A. Br. 32-33; see also Pet. App. 32a (finding specific \njurisdiction \u201csufficiently briefed and argued to allow \n[the court] to reach that issue\u201d).  The court concluded \nthat respondents\u2019 actions relating to the six terrorist at-\ntacks at issue did not create \u201ca substantial connection\u201d \nto the United States.  Pet. App. 32a (quoting Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014)).  \u201cWhile the plaintiff-\nvictims were United States citizens,\u201d id. at 33a, the \ncourt explained that the residence or citizenship of vic-\ntims alone \u201cis an insufficient basis for specific jurisdic-\ntion over the defendants,\u201d id. at 36a; see id. at 39a (dis-\ncussing Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1119).  The court also de-\ntermined that there was \u201cno basis to conclude that [re-\nspondents] participated in these acts in the United \nStates or that their liability for these acts resulted from \ntheir actions that did occur in the United States.\u201d  Id. at \n36a.  And it rejected petitioners\u2019 contention that re-\nspondents had aimed their conduct at the United States \nby targeting U.S. citizens, because it determined that \npetitioners\u2019 own evidence established that the attacks \nwere indiscriminate\u2014not targeted at Americans.  Id. at \n37a-39a; see id. at 45a.  The court contrasted petition-\ners\u2019 suit with previous ATA cases, which it noted had \ninvolved more extensive forum-related conduct.  Id. at \n40a-49a. \n12a\n\n7 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nPrivate actions under the Anti-Terrorism Act are an \nimportant means of fighting terrorism and providing re-\ndress for the victims of terrorist attacks and their fam-\nilies.  The court of appeals held here, however, that this \nparticular action is barred by constitutional constraints \non the exercise of personal jurisdiction because the dis-\ntrict court had neither general nor specific jurisdiction \nover respondents in this suit arising from overseas ter-\nrorist attacks.  Petitioners challenge that conclusion on \nthree grounds:  they argue that respondents lack any \nrights at all under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment (Pet. 22-27); in the alternative the court of \nappeals erred in applying principles of personal juris-\ndiction developed under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to assess jurisdiction under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Pet. \n27-30); and in any event the court of appeals erred in its \napplication of specific-jurisdiction principles to the facts \nof this case (Pet. 30-34).  The court of appeals\u2019 rejection \nof those arguments does not conflict with any decision \nof this Court, implicate any conflict among the courts of \nappeals, or otherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention \nat this time. \n1. The court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that respondents \nare entitled to due process protections does not warrant \nthis Court\u2019s review. \na. The court of appeals\u2019 determination does not con-\nflict with any decision of this Court.  The Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments prohibit the federal govern-\nment and the States, respectively, from depriving any \n\u201cperson\u201d of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due pro-\ncess of law.\u201d  U.S. Const. Amends. V, XIV.  Due process \n13a\n\n8 \n \nrequires that \u201cin order to subject a defendant to a judg-\nment in personam,\u201d the defendant must generally have \nsufficient \u201ccontacts with [the forum] such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional no-\ntions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted); see Insurance Corp. of \nIreland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,  \n456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (explaining that the require-\nments of personal jurisdiction flow \u201cfrom the Due Pro-\ncess Clause\u201d). \nBecause the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments \u201cspeak[] only of \u2018persons,\u2019\u200a\u201d \nLivnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (citation omitted), petition for cert. pending, No. \n17-508 (filed Sept. 28, 2017), whether an entity receives \ndue process protections depends on whether the entity \nqualifies as a \u201cperson.\u201d  This Court has recognized one \nclass of entities that are not \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \ndue process:  the States of the Union.  South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-324 (1966), abrogated \non other grounds by Shelby Cnty. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. \n2612 (2013).  In reaching that result, the Court stated \nonly that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any \nreasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to en-\ncompass the States of the Union.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court has not recognized any other class of  \nentities\u2014whether natural or artificial\u2014as outside the \ncategory of \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of due process.  It \nhas treated as \u201cpersons\u201d domestic and foreign entities \nof various types, such as corporations.  See, e.g., Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316-317 (domestic corpora-\ntion); Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 750-752 \n14a\n\n9 \n \n(2014) (German public stock company); Goodyear Dun-\nlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 918-\n920 (2011) (foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. tire manufac-\nturer).  Because this Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence has \nset only States of the Union outside of the category of \n\u201cpersons,\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions do not establish that \nforeign entities like respondents are barred from invok-\ning due process protections. \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s treatment of respondents as \nentities that receive due process protections also does \nnot conflict with any decision of another court of ap-\npeals.  In fact, the decision below accords with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Livnat, supra, which also held that \nthe PA is entitled to due process protections.  851 F.3d \nat 48, 50.  Livnat appears to be the only other appellate \ndecision addressing the legal status of non-sovereign \nforeign entities that exercise governmental power.1  In \nLivnat, the D.C. Circuit understood this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Katzenbach to reflect the principle that the term \n\u201cperson\u201d excludes \u201csovereigns\u201d\u2014an understanding that \nthe court saw as consistent with common usage.  Id. at \n50 (\u201c[I]n common usage, the term \u2018person\u2019 does not in-\nclude the sovereign.\u201d) (citation omitted).  After noting \nthe distinctive attributes of sovereign entities, the D.C. \nCircuit concluded that foreign non-sovereign govern-\nmental entities like respondents do not fall outside due \nprocess protections.  Id. at 50-52.  In addition, the D.C. \nCircuit rejected the argument that the PA is outside our \ndomestic structure of government, explaining that this \n                                                     \n1 The decisions of the D.C. Circuit and the court of appeals below \naccord with a substantial number of district court decisions conclud-\ning that one or both of respondents have due process rights in the \npersonal jurisdiction context.  See Livnat v. Palestinian Auth.,  \n82 F. Supp. 3d 19, 26 (D.D.C. 2015) (compiling cases). \n15a\n\n10 \n \nCourt had consistently \u201crejected the notion that \u2018alien\u2019 \nentities\u201d\u2014such as foreign corporations\u2014\u201care disquali-\nfied from due-process protection.\u201d  Id. at 50. \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 24-25) that the de-\ncision below conflicts with federal appellate decisions \naddressing the status of foreign sovereigns.  As peti-\ntioners note (Pet. 24), the Second and D.C. Circuits have \nheld that foreign sovereigns lack due process rights\u2014a \nquestion on which this Court reserved decision in Re-\npublic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 \n(1992) (assessing personal jurisdiction over Argentina \nunder specific-jurisdiction principles, while \u201c[a]ssum-\ning, without deciding, that a foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 \nfor purposes of the Due Process Clause\u201d).  See Frontera \nRes. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan \nRepublic, 582 F.3d 393, 399-400 (2d Cir. 2009); Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 95-100 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  But as noted above, the Sec-\nond and D.C. Circuits have recognized that the reason-\ning of those decisions is limited to sovereigns, and they \nhave held that non-sovereign foreign entities like re-\nspondents do receive due process protections.  Pet. App. \n19a-20a; see Livnat, 851 F.3d at 48, 50. \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion (Pet. 24), there is \nalso no conflict between the decision below and City of \nEast St. Louis v. Circuit Court for Twentieth Judicial \nCircuit, 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993), which indi-\ncated that municipalities lack due process rights.  As \nLivnat observed, City of East St. Louis rested on the \n\u201cprinciple that municipalities are creatures of a State \nand therefore lack any constitutional rights against the \nState.\u201d  851 F.3d at 53 (citing City of East St. Louis, 986 \nF.2d at 1144, and discussing cases cited therein, includ-\ning City of Newark v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 192, 196 \n16a\n\n11 \n \n(1923)).  That rationale does not extend to foreign enti-\nties like respondents.  The court of appeals\u2019 treatment \nof respondents as subject to due process protections \ntherefore does not implicate any conflict.2 \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 21) that this Court should \ndecide whether respondents are entitled to due process \nprotections in the absence of a conflict because the de-\ncision below may \u201cinterfere with the Executive\u2019s  \nforeign-affairs prerogatives.\u201d  In the view of the United \nStates, petitioners\u2019 approach poses a greater threat of \nsuch interference.  The power to recognize foreign gov-\nernments is exclusively vested in the President.  Zivo-\ntofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2086 (2015); see ibid. \n(\u201cRecognition is a topic on which the Nation must speak  \n. . .  with one voice.\u201d) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The President\u2019s recognition of a for-\neign state \u201cis a \u2018formal acknowledgement\u2019 that a partic-\nular \u2018entity possesses the qualifications for statehood\u2019 \n                                                     \n2  Petitioners overread the United States\u2019 1988 brief in a case in \nwhich the Palestine Information Office (PIO) challenged an order \nissued by the State Department under the Foreign Missions Act,  \n22 U.S.C. 4301 et seq., and Article II directing the PIO\u2014an agent of \nthe PLO\u2014to cease operations.  See Pet. Reply Br. 7.  The govern-\nment\u2019s brief argued that the court of appeals should reject the \nPLO\u2019s claims of a First Amendment violation because sovereign en-\ntities lack constitutional rights and the PLO was asserting that it \nwas a sovereign entity.  See Pet. Reply App. 41a (\u201cForeign political \nentities such as the PLO, which purport to be sovereign entities, \nhave no constitutional rights.\u201d); id. at 45a (\u201cBecause the PLO pur-\nports to be an independent foreign entity, it has no constitutional \nrights.\u201d); see also id. at 57a (similarly rejecting procedural due pro-\ncess claim).  The government\u2019s argument rested on the incompati-\nbility of the PLO\u2019s assertion of sovereign status with its claim of \nFirst Amendment rights, not on an independent determination that \nthe PLO\u2019s governmental attributes rendered it the equivalent of a \nsovereign.   \n17a\n\n12 \n \nor \u2018that a particular regime is the effective government \nof a state,\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2084 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) \nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 203 \ncmt. a (1987))\u2014not merely a determination that the \nUnited States will \u201caccord [a government] certain ben-\nefits,\u201d Pet. 26.  An approach under which courts would \nassess the extent to which foreign entities operate as \n\u201cthe effective government of a state\u201d or \u201cpossess[] the \nqualifications for statehood,\u201d Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at \n2084 (citation omitted), risks judicial determinations at \nodds with Presidential determinations underlying rec-\nognition. \nc. The Court has not seen any need to revisit the \nscope of the term \u201cperson\u201d under the Due Process \nClauses since Katzenbach, and in any event this case \nwould not be an appropriate vehicle for doing so for two \nreasons.  First, petitioners\u2019 argument relies (Pet. 23-24) \non analogizing respondents to foreign sovereigns and \nmunicipalities, but this Court has not yet passed upon \nthe status of those entities for due process purposes.  \nSecond, because respondents are sui generis entities \nwith a unique relationship to the United States govern-\nment, a ruling on whether respondents have due pro-\ncess protections is unlikely to have broad utility in re-\nsolving future cases concerning other entities.  See Pet. \n8-9 (stating that respondents are not recognized as sov-\nereign by the United States but \u201cinteract with the \nUnited States as a foreign government,\u201d \u201cemploy \u2018for-\neign agents\u2019\u200a\u201d that are registered \u201cas agents of the \u2018Gov-\nernment of a foreign country\u2019\u200a\u201d under the Foreign \nAgents Registration Act of 1938, 22 U.S.C. 611, and \n\u201chave received over a billion dollars\u201d from the United \nStates in \u201cgovernment-to-government assistance\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted). \n18a\n\n13 \n \n2. Certiorari is also not warranted to consider peti-\ntioners\u2019 novel argument that federal courts may exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment \nwhenever \u201ca defendant\u2019s conduct interfered with U.S. \nsovereign interests as set out in a federal statute, and \nthe defendant was validly served with process in the \nUnited States pursuant to a nationwide-service-of- \nprocess provision.\u201d  Pet. Reply Br. 11 (emphasis omit-\nted). \na. The court of appeals\u2019 rejection of petitioners\u2019 \nFifth Amendment theory does not conflict with any de-\ncision of this Court.  This Court has explained that due \nprocess requires \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d with the \nforum \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not \noffend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting \nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  In cases \narising under the Fourteenth Amendment, principles of \ngeneral jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued for \nany conduct in a forum where their contacts are \u201cso \n\u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render them essen-\ntially at home.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919.  Principles \nof specific jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued in \na forum where they are not essentially at home if there \nis \u201can affiliation between the forum and the underlying \ncontroversy, principally [an] activity or an occurrence \nthat takes place in the forum State.\u201d  Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Superior Court, 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017) \n(brackets in original) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).  \nIn the context of an intentional tort, a court may exer-\ncise specific jurisdiction over a defendant who has \u201cex-\npressly aimed\u201d tortious actions at the forum\u2014including \nby committing a tortious act with \u201ckn[owledge] that the \nbrunt of th[e] injury would be felt\u201d there.  Calder v. \n19a\n\n14 \n \nJones, 465 U.S. 783, 789-790 (1984); see Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1123 (2014).  But a court may not \nexercise specific jurisdiction merely because a defend-\nant could foresee that his conduct would have some ef-\nfect in the forum.  Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-790. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s reliance on these principles de-\nveloped in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nassess the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 contacts under \nthe Fifth Amendment does not conflict with any deci-\nsion of this Court.  This Court has repeatedly reserved \nthe question whether the limitations on personal juris-\ndiction under the Fifth Amendment differ from the lim-\nitations under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bristol- \nMyers, 137 S. Ct. at 1783-1784; Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. \nv. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 (1987); see \nalso J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n885 (2011) (plurality opinion); Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 n.* (1987) (opinion of \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Recent personal jurisdiction cases aris-\ning in federal district courts have not presented that \nquestion because \u201c[f]ederal courts ordinarily follow \nstate law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction \nover persons.\u201d  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 753; see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(k)(1)(A) (authorizing service of process on a \ndefendant \u201cwho is subject to the jurisdiction of a court \nof general jurisdiction in the state where the district \ncourt is located\u201d). \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s approach to jurisdiction un-\nder the Fifth Amendment also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Statutes such as \nthe ATA present questions concerning Fifth Amend-\nment jurisdictional limitations because they contain na-\ntionwide service-of-process and venue provisions that \n20a\n\n15 \n \npermit a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over de-\nfendants who would not be subject to suit in the courts \nof the State in which the federal court is located.   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A) and (C) (authorizing service of \nprocess on a defendant who is not \u201csubject to the juris-\ndiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state \nwhere the district court is located\u201d if service is \u201cauthor-\nized by a federal statute\u201d); 18 U.S.C. 2334(a) (providing \nthat an ATA defendant \u201cmay be served in any district \nwhere the defendant resides, is found, or has an agent\u201d).   \nIn analyzing such statutes, courts of appeals gener-\nally have adapted Fourteenth Amendment jurisdic-\ntional principles to the Fifth Amendment context in the \nmanner that the court below did: by considering a de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the Nation as a whole, rather \nthan only contacts with a particular State, in deciding \nwhether the defendant had the contacts needed for per-\nsonal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Application to En-\nforce Admin. Subpoenas Duces Tecum of SEC, 87 F.3d \n413, 417 (10th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhen the personal jurisdic-\ntion of a federal court is invoked based upon a federal \nstatute providing for nationwide or worldwide service, \nthe relevant inquiry is whether the respondent has had \nsufficient minimum contacts with the United States.\u201d); \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55.3  The decision below is consistent \n                                                     \n3  See also Pet.

Pet. App. 23a-50a.  \nPetitioners point to no decision adopting their far \nbroader \u201csovereign interests\u201d theory, under which the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process limitations are satisfied \nso long as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct interfered with U.S. \nsovereign interests as set out in a federal statute, and \nthe defendant was validly served with process in the \nUnited States pursuant to a nationwide-service-of- \nprocess provision.\u201d  Pet.

Henderson Nat\u2019l Bank, \n22a\n\n17 \n \nc. Review of petitioners\u2019 broad Fifth Amendment \narguments would be premature.  Few courts have had \nthe opportunity to consider such arguments.  And the \ncontours and implications of petitioners\u2019 jurisdictional \ntheory\u2014which turns on whether a defendant\u2019s conduct \n\u201cinterfered with U.S. sovereign interests as set out in a \nfederal statute,\u201d Pet. Reply Br. 11\u2014are not themselves \nwell developed.  Under these circumstances, further de-\nvelopment in the lower courts is likely to be useful be-\nfore this Court addresses arguments that the federal \ncourts may, in particular circumstances, exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over civil cases without regard to the \nprinciples of specific and general jurisdiction developed \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \nd. Review of petitioners\u2019 theory is not currently war-\nranted on the ground that application of Fourteenth \nAmendment-derived jurisdictional principles \u201cleaves \nthe [ATA] a practical nullity\u201d and \u201cwould bar most suits \nunder the Act based on overseas attacks.\u201d  Pet. 17.  It is \nfar from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 approach will \nforeclose many claims that would otherwise go forward \nin federal courts.  As the court of appeals explained, its \napproach permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants accused of targeting U.S. citizens in an \n                                                     \n657 F.2d 816, 820, 823-824 (6th Cir. 1981) (rejecting Alabama de-\nfendants\u2019 challenge to jurisdiction of federal court in Tennessee in \nreceivership proceeding), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 949 (1982).  The re-\nmaining decision similarly stated that aggregation of nationwide \ncontacts under the Fifth Amendment might be permissible when a \nstatute authorizes nationwide service of process, but it found no per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant because there was no ap-\nplicable statute of that kind.  Max Daetwyler Corp. v. R. Meyer, 762 \nF.2d 290, 294 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980 (1985).  None of \nthe decisions adopted a standard similar to petitioners\u2019 \u201csovereign \ninterests\u201d theory. \n23a\n\n18 \n \nact of international terrorism.  Pet. App. 45a; see Mor-\nris v. Khadr, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1335-1336 (D. Utah \n2006).  It permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction if \nthe United States was the focal point of the harm caused \nby the defendant\u2019s participation in or support for over-\nseas terrorism.  See Pet. App. 40a (discussing Mwani v. \nBin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (attack on U.S. \nembassy)); id. at 41a-43a (discussing In re Terrorist At-\ntacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. 2013) \n(overseas provision of material support expressly aimed \nat the United States when terrorist organization was \nknown to be targeting the United States), cert. denied, \n134 S. Ct. 2870 (2014)).  And the court of appeals stated \nthat it would permit U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants alleged to have purposefully availed \nthemselves of the privilege of conducting activity in the \nUnited States, by, for example, making use of U.S. fi-\nnancial institutions to support international terrorism.  \nSee id. at 46a-47a (discussing Licci v. Lebanese Cana-\ndian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161 (2d Cir. 2013)).  In addi-\ntion, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants un-\nder the broader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or inter-\nests.  See id. at 44a; accord Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  Un-\nder these circumstances, in the absence of any conflict \nor even a developed body of law addressing petitioners\u2019 \nrelatively novel theory, this Court\u2019s intervention is not \nwarranted. \n3. Finally, certiorari is not warranted to address the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 factbound application of established \nspecific-jurisdiction principles.  See Pet. 30-34.  As a \n24a\n\n19 \n \nthreshold matter, the court of appeals correctly identi-\nfied those principles.  The court analyzed whether \u201cthe \ndefendant\u2019s suit-related conduct  * * *  create[d] a sub-\nstantial connection with the forum State.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a \n(quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121); see id. at 33a \n(framing the inquiry as \u201cwhether the defendants\u2019 suit-\nrelated conduct\u2014their role in the six terror attacks at \nissue\u2014creates a substantial connection with the forum \nState pursuant to the ATA\u201d).  Petitioners misread the \ndecision below as holding that petitioners could estab-\nlish specific jurisdiction only if respondents \u201c\u200a\u2018specifi-\ncally targeted\u2019 U.S. citizens or territory.\u201d  Pet. Reply \nBr. 11 (quoting Pet. App. 45a).  The court of appeals \nstated that respondents had not \u201cspecifically targeted \nUnited States citizens,\u201d Pet. App. 45a, in distinguishing \ntwo cases invoked by petitioners, in which the defend-\nants were accused of providing material support or fi-\nnancing to terrorist organizations whose \u201cspecific aim\u201d \nwas to \u201ctarget[] the United States,\u201d or to \u201ckill Ameri-\ncans and destroy U.S. property,\u201d id. at 42a, 45a (cita-\ntions omitted); see id. at 42a-45a (discussing In re Ter-\nrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. \n2013); United States v. al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. \n2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 986 (2012)).  But the court \nof appeals recognized that specific jurisdiction may ex-\nist when \u201cthe brunt\u201d or \u201cthe focal point\u201d of the harm \nfrom an intentional tort is felt in the forum State.  Id. at \n43a (quoting Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  The court found \npetitioners\u2019 claims did not meet that standard because \nIsrael, not the United States, was \u201cthe focal point of the \ntorts alleged in this litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining disagreements with the deci-\nsion below amount to disagreements about what peti-\ntioners\u2019 evidence established.  Petitioners argue (Pet. \n25a\n\n20 \n \n31-32) that the court erred in applying principles of spe-\ncific jurisdiction because, in petitioners\u2019 view, respond-\nents expressly aimed their conduct at the United States.  \nBut the court of appeals found that the record did not \nestablish that proposition.  Rather, the court concluded, \npetitioners\u2019 \u201cown evidence establishe[d] the random \nand fortuitous nature of the terror attacks.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a.  And it observed that it is \u201cinsufficient to rely on a \ndefendant\u2019s \u2018random, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201cwith the forum to establish specific jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 37a (quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1123).   \nPetitioners similarly argue that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict \nestablishes that respondents intended\u201d to influence \nUnited States policy, because the ATA reaches only \u201cvi-\nolent acts that \u2018appear intended\u2019 either \u2018to influence the \npolicy of a government by intimidation or coercion,\u2019 \u2018to \naffect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, \nassassination, or kidnapping,\u2019 or \u2018to intimidate or coerce \na civilian population.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 31-32 (citation omitted).  \nBut the ATA covers attacks intended to influence for-\neign governments, such as Israel, as well as attacks that \nare intended (or appear intended) to influence the \nUnited States.  As a result, the jury\u2019s verdict does not \ndemonstrate that the court of appeals erred in applying \nprinciples of specific jurisdiction to the record in this case. \nIn any event, a fact-intensive dispute regarding the rec-\nord in this case does not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n26a\n\n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nJENNIFER G.

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation is an internal reflection on my information-gathering process, not new substantive evidence about the case itself. It confirms my previous assessment that the most critical missing piece of information is the respondents' merits brief. As this observation contains no new facts, legal arguments, or signals regarding the case, my task-level beliefs (\u03b8) remain stable and are preserved from my prior update.\n\nMy current, unchanged beliefs are as follows:\n\n*   **The U.S. Government's Two-Pronged Strategy is the Core of the Case:** My understanding, solidified by the Solicitor General's (SG) reply brief, is that the petitioners have presented the Court with two distinct paths to reverse the Second Circuit. This dual-track approach significantly strengthens their position.\n    *   **Path 1 (Narrow):** The primary argument, and the one framed as the easiest \"off-ramp\" for the Court, is that the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA) is a \"fair and reasonable\" application of constructive-consent jurisdiction, consistent with the Court's recent precedent in *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* The SG argues this is a *narrower* and more justifiable use of consent than in *Mallory*, as it is triggered by specific, harmful conduct (making \"martyr payments\") rather than the general act of registering to do business.\n    *   **Path 2 (Broad):** The secondary, \"in any event,\" argument is that the federalism-based due process limits that apply to states under the Fourteenth Amendment do not constrain Congress when it legislates in the realm of foreign affairs and national security under the Fifth Amendment. This argument urges judicial deference to the political branches, citing precedents like *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*.\n\n*   **Probability of Reversal Remains High:** By offering both a narrow, precedent-based path and a broad, separation-of-powers path, the government has created a formidable challenge for the respondents. The Court can choose the rationale it finds most palatable, increasing the overall likelihood of reversal.\n\n*   **Key Uncertainties Are Now Well-Defined:** My predictive focus has shifted from identifying the petitioners' strategy to analyzing how the Court will react to it.\n    1.  **The *Mallory* Question:** The central uncertainty is whether a majority of the Court, particularly the justices who dissented or concurred in *Mallory* (Barrett, Kagan, Sotomayor, Roberts, Alito), will be persuaded by the SG's argument that the PSJVTA is a more limited and thus permissible form of consent-by-conduct.\n    2.  **The Role of the Broader Argument:** The originalist/deference argument is less likely to form the basis of a majority opinion but is a strong candidate for a concurrence, particularly from the Court's originalist wing. Its presence provides an intellectual backstop for reversal.\n\n*   **Next Critical Evidence:** The internal thought process documented in the observation correctly identifies the next essential piece of evidence: the **Brief for Respondents Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian Authority**. My analysis is currently based on the petitioners' affirmative case and their rebuttal to arguments I have not yet seen directly. Reading the respondents' brief is necessary to understand their primary arguments against the PSJVTA's constitutionality, how they distinguish *Mallory*, and how they counter the government's claim for deference in foreign affairs. My understanding of the legal battlefield remains incomplete until their affirmative case is analyzed.",

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO) at the certiorari stage provides the first concrete view of their legal strategy, filling the most significant gap in my previous understanding. While not a full merits brief, it lays out the core arguments that will almost certainly be deployed to counter the petitioners' two-pronged approach. My beliefs have evolved from understanding the petitioners' offense to now understanding the respondents' defense, creating a much more complete picture of the legal battlefield.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict is Now Defined:** The case is a direct clash between the U.S. Government's two paths for reversal and the respondents' multi-layered defense. My prior belief in the strength of the government's two-pronged strategy is now tempered by the coherence and force of the respondents' counter-arguments.\n\n*   **Respondents' Counter to the \"Narrow Path\" (*Mallory*):** I now understand the respondents' primary argument for distinguishing *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* It is more sophisticated than simply stating they are not a corporation.\n    *   **The \"No Quid Pro Quo\" Argument:** The respondents argue that consent-by-registration statutes, as affirmed in *Mallory*, are historically grounded in a *quid pro quo*: a defendant consents to jurisdiction *as a condition of receiving a benefit* (e.g., the right to do business in a state). They contend the PSJVTA lacks this essential element. The PLO and PA are legally *prohibited* from operating in the U.S. (save for UN-related activities). Therefore, the conduct that triggers \"deemed consent\" (like making payments abroad) is not tied to receiving any privilege or benefit from the U.S.\n    *   **\"Legislative Fiction\":** They frame the PSJVTA as an unconstitutional \"legislative fiction.\" They argue Congress cannot simply take conduct that courts have already ruled is insufficient for jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, label it \"consent,\" and thereby command the courts to find jurisdiction. This argument leans on the idea that due process is a factual inquiry into fairness and voluntary submission, not a label Congress can apply at will. They cite *College Savings Bank* for the principle that consent must be knowing and voluntary.\n\n*   **Respondents' Counter to the \"Broad Path\" (Fifth Amendment Deference):** The respondents attack the government's broader argument on both procedural and substantive grounds, providing the Court with potential \"off-ramps.\"\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture (Waiver):** A critical new piece of information is the respondents' claim that the petitioners *forfeited* their broad argument (that the Fifth Amendment's due process clause doesn't impose the same personal jurisdiction limits on Congress as the Fourteenth does on states) by not properly raising it in the lower courts. If the Supreme Court agrees, it could refuse to consider this \"sea change\" in constitutional law, forcing the decision onto the narrower, and for the respondents, more favorable, *Mallory* ground.\n    *   **Substantive Attack & Government Inconsistency:** The respondents characterize the government's theory as radical and unprecedented, noting that \"no court has ever agreed with it.\" Crucially, they point out that the U.S. government itself, in a 2017 brief in a prior version of this case, advised the Court *against* granting certiorari, stating that the petitioners' Fifth Amendment theory was \"not [] well developed\" and created no circuit split. This highlights an inconsistency that could undermine the government's credibility on this point.\n\n*   **Introduction of \"Vehicle Problems\":** The BIO introduces a new category of arguments against the petitioners: that this case is a \"poor vehicle\" for deciding these major constitutional questions. This provides the Court with non-merits-based reasons to affirm the Second Circuit or even dismiss the case. These problems include:\n    1.  **Parallel Litigation:** The *Fuld* plaintiffs have apparently secured a judgment against other defendants on the \"inconsistent theory\" that Hamas, not the respondents, was responsible for the attack.\n    2.  **Finality Issues:** The *Sokolow* case is procedurally old, and the Second Circuit has already denied a motion to recall the mandate, raising finality concerns.\n    3.  **Lack of a Circuit Split:** The respondents emphasize that all lower courts to consider the PSJVTA have found it unconstitutional, and cases are still pending in other circuits (10th and D.C.). They argue the Court should let the issue \"percolate\" further.\n\n*   **Revised Assessment of Uncertainties and Probabilities:** My confidence in a straightforward reversal for the petitioners has decreased. The respondents have presented plausible and powerful arguments that directly counter both of the government's paths to victory.\n    *   The central question is no longer just whether the *Mallory* dissenters can be persuaded, but whether a majority will accept the respondents' \"no quid pro quo\" distinction as a valid reason to wall off *Mallory*.\n    *   The waiver argument provides a significant procedural off-ramp for the Court to avoid the sweeping Fifth Amendment question altogether.\n    *   The \"vehicle problems\" offer further justification for a narrow ruling in the respondents' favor.\n\nThe legal battlefield is now fully mapped. The next critical evidence remains the parties' full merits briefs, which will expand upon these initial strategic outlines.",

BALOUL \n  Counsel of Record \nMITCHELL R. BERGER \nSQUIRE PATTON BOGGS (US) LLP \n2550 M Street, NW \nWashington, D.C. 20037 \nTelephone:  (202) 457-6000 \ngassan.baloul@squirepb.com \nOctober 18, 2024 \n     Counsel for Respondents \n\ni \n \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act (PSJVTA) mandates that courts shall \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States if they \nengage in either of two types of predicate conduct: (i) \npayments relating to Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled as a result of committing overseas attacks \nharming American nationals; or (ii) any actions in the \nUnited States other than participation in the United \nNations, meetings with government officials, and \nactivities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.   \nIn prior cases, courts have uniformly held that the \npayments, which occur entirely outside the United \nStates, do not support personal jurisdiction because \nthey are not connected to the forum or Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims.  For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.  Latching onto the broad provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners in case No. 24-20, who were plaintiffs-\nappellants below, are: Mark I.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

For the same reasons, they similarly held that \nRespondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot support \njurisdiction.  Latching onto the broad provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n \n \n\nii \n \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners in case No. 24-20, who were plaintiffs-\nappellants below, are: Mark I.

That result is hardly \nsurprising, as Respondents have consistently objected \nto personal jurisdiction for more than a decade.  And \ncourts, for almost as long, have held that the same \nkinds of predicate conduct named in the PSJVTA are \ninsufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.  To now \nhold that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction based \non the same constitutionally-insufficient conduct \nwould, as the district court noted, \u201clet fiction get the \nbetter of fact and make a mockery of the Due Process \nClause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a. \nTo avoid that holding, Plaintiffs broadly claim the \nFifth Amendment does not protect an individual \nliberty interest in personal jurisdiction.  That \nargument was forfeited below, and was not addressed \nby the court of appeals.  The Government similarly \nseeks a sea change in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional \ndue process.  But no court has ever agreed with its \ntheory that the Fifth Amendment requires only a \ngeneric \u201cfairness\u201d test uninformed by this Court\u2019s \nprior \nlimitations \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.  \nInextricably mired in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \nthis case is a particularly poor vehicle for resolving \nthose sweeping constitutional questions.  New \njurisdictional rules governing all federal question \ncases and foreign corporations should not be created \nfor a unique statute targeting two sui generis entities.  \nNor do these cases even raise those issues.  Both \nPetitioners ask whether Congress can impose \njurisdiction on Respondents, when the actual text of \nthe PSJVTA raises a different question.  That \nquestion is whether Respondents can be deemed to \n\n2 \n \n \nhave consented to jurisdiction under this Court\u2019s \nimplied-consent cases.  Though Petitioners largely \nignore those cases, the Second Circuit correctly \nconsidered the statute under Bauxites and Mallory, \nconcluding that Respondents did not submit to \njurisdiction by engaging in the same conduct \npreviously held insufficient to satisfy due process.  \nThis is a straightforward application of the principle \nthat Congress \u201cdoes not ... have the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Quill Corp. v. \nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992).   \nThese cases are not suitable vehicles for other \nreasons as well.  The Fuld plaintiffs recently obtained \na $191 million judgment against other defendants on \nthe inconsistent theory that the same attack was \nplanned by Hamas, executed by a Hamas operative, \nand intended to undermine Respondents\u2019 legitimacy.  \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs face even greater hurdles\u2014it \nhas been eight years since that case became final, and \nthe last time the court of appeals refused to recall its \nmandate to preserve finality was five years ago.  \nOther problems stemming from Sokolow\u2019s decades-old \nhistory abound. \nSimilar cases are making their way through the D.C. \nand Tenth Circuits.  This Court should wait for the \nlaw to develop before considering certiorari on the \nPSJVTA, especially when no court has ever agreed \nwith the bold positions staked out by Petitioners.  The \npetitions accordingly should be denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a. 1   The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \n \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n3 \n \n \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \npublic schools and education, with over 155,000 \ngovernment employees.  Id. at 143-44a.  Under the \nOslo Accords, the PLO conducts Palestinian foreign \naffairs, including operating its UN and other foreign \nmissions.  Id. at 6a.   \nThe United States does not recognize Respondents \nas sovereign, but \u201ccurrently assists training of PA \nsecurity forces,\u201d which is \u201ca key partner in efforts to \nstabilize the West Bank.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 5 n.2.  The United \nStates believes \u201cthe future of Gaza must include \nPalestinian-led governance and the unification of \nGaza with the West Bank under the PA.\u201d  Id.  \nRespondents are currently forbidden from operating \nin the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201(b), 5202, \n2378b note; United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \na Palestinian mission to conduct activities relating to \nits role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. App. \n10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that mission closed in 2018, \nbefore the PSJVTA became effective.  Id.  Other than \nthe UN Mission, Respondents have no offices or \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \n A. Courts unanimously agree Respondents \nare not subject to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause \nRespondents \ndo \nnot \nmaintain \nany \nconstitutionally-meaningful connection to the United \nStates, federal courts have long held that exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents for alleged \nattacks in Israel and Palestine would violate due \nprocess.  In Sokolow, plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \n\n4 \n \n \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170-78a.  That Americans were \ninjured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id.  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nown experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d \nas the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  Id. at 170a.2   \nPlaintiffs sought certiorari, raising many of the \nsame arguments as the current petitions regarding \nthe standard for due process under the Fifth \nAmendment.  Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Mar. 3, \n2017).   \nThe United States, however, recommended against \ncertiorari.  Resp. App. 7a.  It warned that plaintiffs\u2019 \nFifth Amendment analysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d \nand that the decision did \u201cnot conflict with any \ndecision of this Court, implicate any conflict among \nthe courts of appeals, or otherwise warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21-24a (\u201cPetitioners \npoint to no decision adopting their [] theory ... [i]ndeed, \nthe D.C. Circuit concluded that \u2018[n]o court has ever\u2019 \nadopted such an argument.\u201d).  Notably, the United \nStates flatly rejected the argument that denying \njurisdiction harmed anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing \nin the court\u2019s opinion calls into question the United \nStates\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants under the \nbroader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  This Court denied certiorari.  \nSokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. 915 (2018). \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n5 \n \n \n B. Congress tries different approaches to \njurisdiction \nin the \nATCA \nand \nthe \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134-35a; see also \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.     \nWhile the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certiorari \nin that case was pending, Congress intervened again \nby enacting the PSJVTA.  The PSJVTA requires \ncourts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201cconsent\u201d \nto personal jurisdiction if, after certain dates, they \nengage in either of two types of conduct: (i) outside the \nUnited \nStates, \nmaking \npayments \nrelating \nto \nPalestinians imprisoned or killed as a result of \ncommitting overseas attacks harming American \nnationals; or (ii) in the United States, engaging in \nactions other than UN participation, meetings with \ngovernment officials, and activities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The PSJVTA takes the same \nconduct rejected by the courts of appeals as \ninsufficient to create personal jurisdiction, and \n\n6 \n \n \ninstructs courts to now treat it as \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld \nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Id. 3   The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC. \nThe lower courts unanimously hold that \napplying the PSJVTA would violate due \nprocess.  \nIn both Sokolow and Fuld, the district court held \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions \nviolated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nId. at 15a, 60a.  The courts reviewed extensive \nevidence and briefing regarding the factual predicates \nof the PSJVTA, but declined to decide if the U.S. \nactivities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at 15a, 67-68a, \n74a.  Two other district courts also reached the same \nconclusion, one of which is currently on appeal in the \nTenth Circuit.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 \nWL 826409, *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. \nPLO, 688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \n \n3 The Fuld plaintiffs waived any argument the attack targeted \nAmericans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4. \n\n7 \n \n \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nThe Second Circuit also relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023).  Mallory \u201cunderscores\u201d the difference \u201cbetween \nthe PSJVTA and business registration statutes,\u201d \nbecause unlike the statute at issue in Mallory, the \n\u201cPSJVTA does not require that the PLO and the PA \nconsent to jurisdiction as a condition of securing a \nlegal right to do business in the United States, which \nremains prohibited under current law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  \nUnlike \nthe \ncorporate \ndefendants \nin \nMallory, \nRespondents did not accept \u201csome in-forum benefit in \nreturn for an agreement to be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit then denied en banc review.  In \na concurrence to that denial, Judge Bianco (a member \nof the Panel) explained that nothing in the Panel\u2019s \nopinion requires an \u201cexchange of benefits\u201d as the sole \nbasis to infer consent, and that the PSJVTA in any \nevent falls outside the Mallory line of \u201cexchange of \nbenefits\u201d cases.  Id. at 212-15a.  Adopting the new \n\u201cnexus\u201d tests proposed by Petitioners, he explained, \n\u201cwould allow Congress to subject any foreign entity to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, even in the \nabsence of any contacts with the United States, if that \nentity knowingly and voluntary engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute \nconsent.\u201d  Id. at 216a.  This \u201cwould allow the \ngovernment to declare conduct to be consent, even if \n\n8 \n \n \nthat conduct could not reasonably be considered to be \nconsent.\u201d  Id.  \nREASONS TO DENY THE PETITIONS \nI. \nThe decisions below are faithful to Bauxites \nand Mallory.    \nThe Second Circuit scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Bauxites and Mallory.  Applying \nthat precedent, it held that the PSJVTA\u2019s deemed \nconsent provisions fail to create personal jurisdiction \nbecause the activities they specify do not \u201csupport a \nfair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nId. at 26a.  This also followed a unanimous line of \ndecisions holding that Respondents\u2019 actions lack \nsufficient connection to the United States to justify \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction.  Id. at 8-9a; e.g., \nShatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, 1036-37.  The court of \nappeals thus explained that \u201cCongress cannot take \nconduct otherwise insufficient to support an inference \nof consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.  \nThis result flows naturally from established precedent.   \nA. \nConsent to personal jurisdiction must be \nbased \non \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nconduct reflecting legal submission to \njurisdiction. \n \u201cBecause the requirement of personal jurisdiction \nrepresents first of all an individual right, it can, like \nother such rights, be waived.\u201d  Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 \n(1982).  A party may expressly consent to the court\u2019s \njurisdiction, or impliedly consent by \u201csignal[ing]\u201d its \nagreement \u201cthrough actions rather than words.\u201d  Roell \nv. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 589-91 (2003).  Bauxites \ncataloged a \u201cvariety of legal arrangements [that] have \nbeen taken to represent express or implied consent to \n\n9 \n \n \nthe personal jurisdiction of the court,\u201d including \nsubmission \u201cby appearance,\u201d forum-selection clauses, \nstipulation, \u201cconstructive consent\u201d through \u201cthe \nvoluntary use of certain state procedures,\u201d and failure \nto assert a jurisdictional defense.  456 U.S. at 703-04.  \nEach of these \u201clegal arrangements\u201d reflects some \n\u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \u201camount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Id. at 703-\n05.  See Pet. App. 20-21a. \n\u201c[W]hether express or implied,\u201d however, this Court \nhas \u201cemphasiz[ed]\u201d that a party\u2019s consent to \njurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d  \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, \n685 (2015).  An \u201ceffective waiver of a constitutional \nright\u201d generally requires proof of \u201cthe \u2018intentional \nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or \nprivilege.\u2019\u201d  College Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 682 \n(1999).  Because implied or \u201cconstructive\u201d consent \u201cis \nnot a doctrine commonly associated with the \nsurrender of constitutional rights,\u201d federal courts \n\u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 681-82. \nIn \nsome \ncases, \nthe \ncourt \nbelow \nexplained, \ndetermining whether a defendant knowingly and \nvoluntarily consented to personal jurisdiction is \nstraightforward.  Pet. App. 19-20a.  A party may \nexpressly agree to litigate in a particular forum.  Id.  \nCourts may also infer consent to jurisdiction based on \nactions in the litigation itself that demonstrate \nsubmission to jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Roell, 538 U.S. at \n584 (parties who \u201cvoluntarily participated in the \nentire course of proceedings\u201d without objecting to \njurisdiction \u201cclearly implied their consent\u201d \u201cby their \nactions\u201d).  These canonical forms of consent are not at \nissue, however, because Petitioners do not claim that \nRespondents expressly consented, or took any \n\n10 \n \n \nlitigation action evincing submission to jurisdiction.  \nSee Pet. App. 25a. \nAbsent express consent or litigation conduct \nevincing submission to jurisdiction, determining \nwhether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to personal jurisdiction is more difficult.  To \nestablish \nimplied \nconsent, \nPlaintiffs \nmust \ndemonstrate some \u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that \n\u201camount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-05.  This is \u201ca deeply \nfactbound analysis\u201d that requires the court to \ndetermine \u201cwhether [defendant\u2019s] actions evinced the \nrequisite knowing and voluntary consent.\u201d  Wellness \nInt\u2019l, 575 U.S. at 685-86.  See Pet. App. 32a.   \nIn \nmaking \nthis \ndetermination, \nthis \nCourt \ndistinguishes \nbetween \ninferring \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowing \nand \nvoluntary \nchoice \nto \nsubmit \nto \njurisdiction by its own conduct, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 \nof power\u201d by the forum to impose jurisdiction on \nnonconsenting defendants.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 705.  \nBauxites examined whether the defendant\u2019s failure to \ncomply with court-ordered jurisdictional discovery \ncould be treated as constructive waiver of its objection \nto personal jurisdiction.  Bauxites held that it could, \nbut only because the \u201cpreservation of due process was \nsecured by the presumption\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \nspecific conduct\u2014its \u201cfailure to supply the requested \ninformation as to its contacts with [the forum]\u201d\u2014\u201cwas \nbut an admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d  Id. at 705, 709 (quoting Hammond Packing \nCo. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909)).  By \nrefusing to produce the requested materials, the \ndefendant implicitly acknowledged that it did have \nsufficient contacts with the forum to support personal \njurisdiction.  Id. at 706.  The defendant\u2019s conduct thus \nserved as a constructive waiver of any objection to \njurisdiction.  See id. (\u201c[T]he sanction is nothing more \n\n11 \n \n \nthan the invocation of a legal presumption, or what is \nthe same thing, the finding of a constructive waiver.\u201d); \nPet. App. 32a. \nTo illustrate the \u201cdue process limits\u201d that apply to \nconstructive consent, Bauxites distinguished Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), \u201cin which the Court held \nthat it did violate due process for a court to take \nsimilar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey [a \ncourt] order\u201d unrelated to the asserted defense.  \nBauxites, 456 U.S. at 705-06 (emphasis added).  The \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in that case\u2014failure \u201cto pay into \nthe registry of the court a certain sum of money\u201d\u2014did \nnot support the presumption of a \u201cwant of merit\u201d in its \nasserted defense.  Id.  Subjecting the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction, the Court explained, therefore \nconstituted an improper penalty, rather than a valid \npresumption of constructive waiver drawn from the \ndefendant\u2019s own conduct.  See id. at 706 (\u201cDue process \nis violated only if the behavior of the defendant will \nnot support the Hammond Packing presumption.\u201d).  \nAs the court below explained, this Court also \ndistinguished between valid, implied consent to \njurisdiction \nand \nthe \nimproper \nimposition \nof \njurisdiction in College Savings Bank.  Pet. App. 39-40a.  \nIn that case, plaintiffs argued a state agency waived \nits immunity and \u201cimpliedly\u201d consented to jurisdiction \nby knowingly and voluntarily engaging in interstate \nmarketing after a federal statute stated that such \nactivity would subject it to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at \n671, 676.  Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia \nrejected this \u201cconstructive-waiver\u201d theory based on \nthe difference between a party\u2019s waiver of immunity \nand \n\u201cCongress\u2019s \nexpressing \nunequivocally \nits \nintention that if the State takes certain action it shall \nbe deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d  Id. at 680-\n81.  He emphasized that a voluntary decision to waive \nimmunity was different from being \u201cput on notice that \n\n12 \n \n \nCongress intends to subject\u201d the state to personal \njurisdiction.  Id.  The constitutional requirement of \nconsent would mean nothing if Congress had \u201c[the] \npower to exact constructive waivers\u201d of jurisdictional \ndefenses \u201cthrough the exercise of Article I powers.\u201d  Id. \nat 683.  Merely providing notice of Congress\u2019s intent \nto subject the defendant to jurisdiction if it \n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaged in \u201cfederally regulated conduct\u201d \nwas insufficient to establish a constructive waiver.  Id. \nat 679-82.  See Pet. App. 40-41a.     \nIn describing the circumstances in which plaintiffs \ncould demonstrate implied consent to jurisdiction, \nCollege Savings Bank located valid \u201cconsent\u201d in the \nchoice to accept a government benefit or privilege \nconditioned upon consent.  Congress may \u201ccondition \nits grant of [federal] funds to the States\u201d upon their \nwillingness to consent to jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at 686-\n87.  The \u201cacceptance of the funds\u201d by the State would \nsignal its \u201cagreement\u201d to the condition attached.  Id.  \nAccepting this type of \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d conditioned \non consent to jurisdiction, however, presents a \n\u201cfundamentally different\u201d case than the imposition of \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Id.  In the latter case, \n\u201cwhat Congress threatens if the State refuses to agree \nto its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, \nbut a sanction.\u201d  Id.4   \nThis Court has used that same barometer to \nevaluate other implied consent statutes.  Many states, \nfor example, condition the \u201cprivilege\u201d of driving on \npublic roads on consent to personal jurisdiction for \nrelated lawsuits.  Because the state has the \nantecedent authority \u201cto regulate the use of its \n \n4  Although College Savings Bank addressed state sovereign \nimmunity, its analysis was based on broader constitutional \nprinciples as it relied on the \u201cclassic description of an effective \nwaiver of a constitutional right.\u201d  527 U.S. at 681-82. \n\n13 \n \n \nhighways\u201d and to \u201cexclude\u201d non-residents from such \nuse, states may also require non-residents to consent \nto jurisdiction \u201cin advance of the operation of a motor \nvehicle on its highway.\u201d  Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. \n352, 354-57 (1927).  By \u201caccept[ing]\u201d the \u201cprivilege[]\u201d \nof driving on public roads, a non-resident defendant \nimplicitly \u201csignifi[es] \u2026 his agreement,\u201d through his \nconduct, to consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nforum.  Id. \nAs the court of appeals explained, Mallory similarly \nheld that consent may be inferred from a defendant\u2019s \nacceptance of a benefit \u201cwith jurisdictional strings \nattached.\u201d  600 U.S. at 145; Pet. App. 32-33a.  Mallory \nreaffirmed that Bauxites provides the governing \nstandard for implied consent statutes, and requires a \ncourt to evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s \u201cactions \u2026 \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of \n[the] court.\u2019\u201d  600 U.S. at 145-46 (plurality op.); id. at \n147-49 (Jackson, J., concurring); id. at 153, 156 (Alito, \nJ., concurring in part); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting) \n(each \nciting \nBauxites). \n \nBusiness \nregistration statutes\u2014under which a corporation \n\u201cconsents\u201d to personal jurisdiction \u201cin exchange \u2018for \naccess to [a State\u2019s] markets\u2019\u201d\u2014are one of the \u201cvariety \nof legal arrangements\u201d that can give rise to valid \nconsent under Bauxites.  Id. at 141 n.8 (emphasis \nadded).  See Pet. App. 32-35a. \nMallory\u2019s discussion of the grounds for inferring \nvalid consent to jurisdiction \u201cunderscores\u201d the \ndifference \u201cbetween the PSJVTA and business \nregistration statutes.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  Unlike a \nbusiness registration statute, the PSJVTA \u201cdoes not \nrequire that the PLO and the PA consent to \njurisdiction as a condition of securing a legal right to \ndo business in the United States, which remains \nprohibited under current law.\u201d  Id.  It also does not \noffer \u201csome in-forum benefit\u201d for Respondents to \n\n14 \n \n \naccept \u201cin return for an agreement to be amenable to \nsuit in the United States.\u201d  Id.  The PSJVTA thus falls \noutside the exchange of benefits cases reaffirmed by \nMallory, which hinge on \u201caccepting an in-[forum] \nbenefit with jurisdictional strings attached.\u201d  600 U.S. \nat 145.  The PSJVTA, on the other hand, relies on \nconduct that courts have repeatedly held cannot \nconstitutionally support personal jurisdiction.  Pet. \nApp. 8-9a.  \nAs College Savings Bank recognized, if the activity \npurportedly giving rise to \u201cconsent\u201d does not require \nauthorization from the forum, the defendant\u2019s choice \nto engage in the activity does not reflect any implied \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction because the \nactivity does not depend on any benefit (or \u201cgratuity\u201d) \nconferred by the forum.  527 U.S. at 680-81.  In such \na case, \u201cthere is little reason to assume actual consent \nbased upon the [defendant\u2019s] mere presence in a field \nsubject to congressional regulation.\u201d  Id.  See Pet. App. \n109a. \nThis does not mean, as the court of appeals was \ncareful to explain, that reciprocity or an exchange of \nbenefits is necessary for knowing and voluntary \nconsent.  Pet. App. 35a n.13, 212-13a.  Consent may \nalso be express, for example, or implied through the \nfailure to comply with procedural rules.  See Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 703-05.  But Petitioners never identified a \nsingle case implying consent to jurisdiction based on a \ndefendant\u2019s choice to engage in non-litigation-related \nactivities in the absence of some benefit or privilege \nconferred upon the defendant in exchange for its \nconsent.  Pet. App. 43a.  As the court below concluded, \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s \u201capproach to deemed consent is \u2018simply \nunheard of.\u201d  Id.   \n \n \n\n15 \n \n \nB. \nRespondents did not knowingly and \nvoluntarily submit to jurisdiction. \nThe court of appeals measured the PSJVTA against \nthose longstanding standards, and unsurprisingly \nheld the statute fails to provide knowing and \nvoluntary consent to personal jurisdiction in this case.  \nRather than identifying conduct that might actually \ndemonstrate implied consent (such as the acceptance \nof U.S. foreign aid or another government benefit), \nCongress \u201csimply declared\u201d that conduct the Second \nand \nD.C. \nCircuits \nhad \nalready \nheld \nwas \nconstitutionally insufficient to support personal \njurisdiction \u201cconstitute[s] \u2018consent\u2019 to jurisdiction.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a.  \u201cNo aspect of these allegedly \njurisdiction-triggering activities can reasonably be \ninterpreted as evincing the defendants\u2019 \u2018intention to \nsubmit\u2019 to the United States courts.\u201d  Id.  Those \nholdings do not warrant this Court\u2019s attention. \n1. Payments made in Palestine do not reflect \nsubmission to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. \nThe \nreasoning \nof \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nis \nstraightforward.  The first type of conduct specified by \nthe PSJVTA\u2014payments made in Palestine to families \nof every person imprisoned or killed in the conflict\u2014\nhas no connection to the United States.  Id. at 26-27a.  \nThe payments at issue occur entirely outside the \nUnited States under a uniform Palestinian law, and \ndo \nnot \nrequire \nauthorization \nfrom \nthe \nU.S. \ngovernment or the involvement of any U.S. entity.  \nThe payments reflect Respondents\u2019 own domestic laws \nand policies, rather than some implicit agreement to \nknowingly and voluntarily submit to jurisdiction in \nthe United States.  Accordingly, under the framework \nset forth in Bauxites, the payments \u201cdo not infer any \nintention on the part of Defendants to legally submit \n\n16 \n \n \nto suit in the United States\u201d\u2014as the lower courts \ncorrectly recognized.  Id. at 74a, 27a. \nPetitioners conflate federal authority to penalize \nextraterritorial conduct (so-called \u201cprescriptive\u201d or \n\u201clegislative\u201d jurisdiction) and federal authority to \nsubject \nnonresident \ndefendants \nto \npersonal \njurisdiction in U.S. courts (so-called \u201cadjudicative\u201d \njurisdiction).  Although Congress may legislate that \nsuch payments can subject a party to liability (or some \nother sanction), that prescriptive authority does not \nanswer the separate constitutional question whether \nRespondents can be forced to adjudicate such claims \nin U.S. courts.  As noted above, courts have already \nheld that the payments fail to establish the \nconstitutionally \nrequisite \n\u201cconnection\u201d \nbetween \nRespondents, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the United States \nto support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.   \nPetitioners suggest that the payments bear a close \n\u201cconnection\u201d to the ATA claims at issue because they \nare made by reason of attacks that injured or killed \nU.S. nationals.  See Gov\u2019t Pet. 17.  That assertion \noverlooks the courts\u2019 consistent holdings that the \nattacks at issue (and thus payments following from \nsuch attacks) did not target the United States, and \n\u201caffected United States citizens only because they \nwere victims of indiscriminate violence that occurred \nabroad.\u201d  Pet. App. 168a.  Because the attacks were \nnot jurisdictionally connected to the United States, \npost-attack payments a fortiori lack a jurisdictional \nnexus. \nThe payments are part of a broader program \ndesigned to provide a \u201csocial safety net in the face of \nbrutal and oppressive living conditions under Israeli \n\n17 \n \n \nmilitary occupation.\u201d5  The PA thus provides welfare \npayments to all families of Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled for political crimes and security offenses\u2014broad \nlegislation that recognizes that 70% of Palestinian \nfamilies have at least one relative detained by Israel.6  \nTens of thousands of prisoners and families receive \nthe monthly payments.\n7   Given this context, \nportraying these payments as intended to incentivize \nterrorism is \u201cwrong and incendiary.\u201d8   \n2. Petitioners failed to argue U.S. activities \nthat could create jurisdiction, and then \nwaived the argument on appeal. \nThe court of appeals did not decide whether the \nPSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities predicate was met, or if facts \nmight someday exist that could justify jurisdiction.  \nThough Respondents created a significant factual \nrecord on that predicate before the trial courts, \nPetitioners made only fleeting references to that \nrecord on appeal.  Petitioners\u2019 claim that the issue was \n\u201cuncontested\u201d \nbelow \nis \nseriously \nwrong \nand \nmisleading.  Pl. Pet. 9-10, 29-30; see Gov\u2019t Pet. 15 \n(claiming \u201c[n]or is there any dispute\u201d about the U.S. \nactivities prong). \na.

Pet.

Sokolow D.Ct. Doc. 1066, Ex. 1-3. \nRespondents also debunked Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of U.S. \nnotarial \u201ccertification\u201d services (a claim repeated in \ntheir petition, Pl. Pet. 29).  In depositions, the state-\nlicensed notaries denied having any authority to act \nfor, or being compensated by, Respondents.  Fuld D.Ct. \nDoc. 42 at 22-23 & Doc. 50 at 8-9; Sokolow D.Ct. Doc. \n1064 at 12-14 (summarizing evidence).  In the end, the \ncourts did not decide if the U.S. activities prong was \ntriggered.  Pet. App. 15a n.4, 67-68a.  But they did \nhold that even the U.S. activities as alleged were \u201ctoo \nthin to support a meaningful inference of consent to \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 108a, 74a. \nb.  Before the court of appeals, Petitioners\u2019 opening \nbriefs did not meaningfully delve into the facts \nregarding the U.S. activities.  To the contrary, \n \n9 Plaintiffs argued Respondents\u2019 UN mission would trigger the \nPSJVTA if its social media posts constituted \u201cpropaganda.\u201d  That \nposition would render the statute unconstitutionally vague. \n\n19 \n \n \nPlaintiffs expressly requested that the court of \nappeals not decide the U.S. activities issue.  See \nSokolow C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 542 at 35 n.3 (asking \ncourt of appeals not to decide second factual predicate); \nFuld C.A. Pl. Reply Doc. 161 at 26 n.7 (same).  The \nGovernment, for its part, did not dispute that the UN \nmission was Respondents\u2019 only office in the United \nStates.  Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 73 at 7.  It also took \n\u201cno position on whether any of the statute\u2019s factual \npredicates have been satisfied.\u201d  Fuld D.Ct. Doc. 53 at \n8 n.5.  Respondents, on appeal, affirmed they had no \n\u201cphysical presence\u201d in the U.S. other than their UN \nmission and did not engage in any \u201cnon-UN-related \nactivities in the United States.\u201d  Fuld C.A. Def. Br. \nDoc. 148 at 23 n.2, 46-47, 48 n.19.  Respondents noted \ntheir arguments about the UN mission\u2019s activities in \nthe trial court.  Id. at 48 n.20.   \nGiven that Petitioners asked it not to decide the U.S. \nactivities \nquestion, \nthe \ncourt \nof \nappeals \nunsurprisingly found it \u201cunnecessary to address that \nquestion on this appeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (Fuld); id. at \n68a (Sokolow).  The court of appeals instead explained \nthat Respondents are \u201cprohibited\u201d from operating in \nthe United States.  Id. at 28-29a.  And that \u201cUN-\nrelated conduct and offices \u2026 are protected pursuant \nto international treaty\u201d and, \u201cas set forth in 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3), are exempt from the PSJVTA\u2019s second \nprong.\u201d  Id.  Nor could the PSJVTA be read as \nconferring a benefit, in any case, \u201cbecause the \ndefendants have not been granted permission to \nengage in th[e] [prohibited] activities at all.\u201d  Id.  The \ncourt of appeals made clear that any such permission \nwould have to be granted \u201cformal[ly]\u201d (id. at n.9), \nbelying the Government\u2019s argument that the \u201ccourt \ndid not offer a defense of its premise that the \ngovernment must affirmatively permit the relevant \nactivity through the PSJVTA itself or another statute.\u201d  \n\n20 \n \n \nGov\u2019t Pet. 21.  For those reasons, the \u201csecond prong of \nthe PSJVTA similarly specifies predicate conduct that \ndoes not evince the defendants\u2019 agreement to subject \nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the United States \ncourts.\u201d  Pet. App. 27a.  \n This \nCourt \nshould \nnot \nconsider \nwhether \nRespondents triggered the U.S. activities prong as a \nmatter of first impression.  See CRST Van Expedited, \nInc. v. EEOC, 578 U.S. 419, 435 (2016) (\u201cIt is not the \nCourt\u2019s usual practice to adjudicate either legal or \npredicate factual questions in the first instance.\u201d).  \n3. Unlike the ATCA, the PSJVTA does not \nrely on benefits conditioned on consent. \nThe PSJVTA\u2019s failure to establish valid, implied \nconsent to jurisdiction is well-illustrated by the \ncontrast with its predecessor statute, the ATCA.  The \nATCA provided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they \naccepted either of two government benefits: (1) U.S. \nforeign aid, or (2) the \u201cbenefit[]\u201d of a formal \u201cwaiver or \nsuspension\u201d of the prohibitions on their activities \nunder the 1987 ATA.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018). \nRegarding the ATCA, the Government argued that \nbecause \u201cthe political branches have long imposed \nconditions on these benefits,\u201d it was \u201creasonable and \nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment\u201d for Congress \n\u201cto determine that the [PLO\u2019s] maintenance of an \noffice in this country after a waiver \u2026, or the [PA\u2019s] \ncontinued receipt of certain foreign assistance, should \nbe \u2018deemed\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d  U.S. \nBrief 12-13, Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 13, 2019) (emphasis added).  The \nATCA satisfied due process, in other words, because it \ngrounded \u201cdeemed consent\u201d on Respondents\u2019 choice to \naccept or reject benefits conditioned upon consent.  \nBoth the Second and D.C. Circuits held that the ATCA \n\n21 \n \n \ndid \nnot \ncreate \npersonal \njurisdiction \nbecause \nRespondents elected not to accept either benefit.  Pet. \nApp. 10-11a; Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1128-31.   \nThe PSJVTA, by contrast, does not confer any \nbenefit on Respondents in exchange for their \npurported \u201cconsent.\u201d  It does not authorize them to \nengage in activities in the United States prohibited by \nthe 1987 ATA and similar statutes, and does not \nextend any government benefit (e.g., foreign aid) \nconditioned upon consent to personal jurisdiction.10  \nNor have Respondents received any benefit because \nthe PSJVTA does not alter preexisting prohibitions on \ntheir U.S. activities.  The court of appeals expressly \nleft undecided whether the PSJVTA could be \nconstitutional \u201cunder different circumstances\u201d (for \nexample, if Respondents began non-UN operations in \nthe United States).  Pet. App. 38a; id. at 27-29a.  But \nthat is a benefit not presently offered by the United \nStates to Respondents.  \nII.   The petitions fail to raise any circuit split or \nissue of exceptional importance.  \nThe petitions in this case are exceptional only in \nthat no court has ever agreed with the positions they \nespouse.  The lower courts are unanimous in holding \nthe PSJVTA is unconstitutional in these cases.  They \nare equally unanimous in rejecting Petitioners\u2019 \narguments that the Fifth Amendment presents \nfundamentally different protections to individual \nliberty than the Fourteenth.  Nor do these petitions \n \n10 Various statutes prohibit Respondents from operating in the \nU.S., including the 1987 ATA, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 (barring the PLO \nand, now, its successor-in-part, the PA, from maintaining an \noffice or expending funds in the U.S.), and the 2006 ATA, \u00a7 7(a), \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378b note (making it \u201cunlawful\u201d to operate \u201cat the \nbehest or direction of, or with funds provided by, the Palestinian \nAuthority\u201d).  See Pet. App. 28a n.9. \n\n22 \n \n \npresent matters hampering U.S. antiterrorism efforts.  \nNor is the PSJVTA of broad applicability\u2014it only \napplies to two sui generis entities for which the federal \ncourts repeatedly rejected jurisdiction.   \nA. \nThe petitions raise no split in authority \nor disagreement between the circuits. \n1.  Every court to reach the issue agrees the \nPSJVTA does not create consent to jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs in three New York cases used the PSJVTA \nto claim personal jurisdiction.  The trial courts \nunanimously found that satisfaction of the statute\u2019s \nfactual predicates did not demonstrate consent to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 94a, 80a, 71a; Shatsky, \n2022 WL 826409, *4-5.  A Colorado district court \nagreed, finding \u201cthat Congress cannot simply legislate \nthat \u2018any conduct, without regard for its connections \nto the United States generally \u2026 signals a party\u2019s \nintent to submit to the jurisdiction of a United States \ncourt.\u2019\u201d  Levine, 688 F. Supp. 3d at 1010.  The Second \nCircuit agreed.  Pet. App. 38a, 69-70a. \nIn addition to unanimity on the PSJVTA, federal \ncourts agree on the standards for jurisdictional due \nprocess under the Fifth Amendment.  Every circuit to \nreach the issue agrees that the minimum contacts and \nconsent standards developed under the Fourteenth \nAmendment apply under the Fifth Amendment.  See \nPet. App. 49-51a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54-56; Douglass \nv. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 \n(5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cBoth Due Process Clauses \nuse the same language and serve the same purpose, \nprotecting individual liberty by guaranteeing limits \non personal jurisdiction.  Every court that has \nconsidered this point agrees that the standards mirror \neach other.\u201d); id. at 238 n.22 (collecting cases from \nvarious circuits); Herederos De Roberto Gomez \nCabrera v. Teck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th \n\n23 \n \n \nCir. 2022) (\u201cthe operative language of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments is materially identical, and \nit would be incongruous for the same words to \ngenerate markedly different doctrinal analyses\u201d).  \u201cTo \nsuppose that \u2018due process of law\u2019 meant one thing in \nthe Fifth Amendment and another in the Fourteenth \nis too frivolous to require elaborate rejection.\u201d  \nMalinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 415 (1945) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring). \nNot one case supports Petitioners\u2019 views that the \ndue process standards should be abandoned or relaxed \nunder the Fifth Amendment.  See Pet. App. 45-46a.  \nCourts \nhave \nlong \nrejected \nthe \nnotion \n\u201cthat \nfederalism\u2019s irrelevance in the Fifth Amendment \ncontext justifies a \u2018more lenient\u2019 standard for personal \njurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 48a; Douglass, 46 F.4th at 239 \nn.24 (collecting cases from various circuits). \n2.  Petitioners do not defend the PSJVTA on the \nbasis of consent\u2014even though the statutory language \ndepends exclusively on \u201cconsent.\u201d  Instead, Petitioners \nask this Court to opine broadly on Congress\u2019s power to \nimpose jurisdiction on Respondents. \nPetitioners give no more than lip service to the \nconcept of consent, and instead focus on whether \nCongress can legislatively impose jurisdiction on \nRespondents if they do not comply with Congress\u2019s \ndemands.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 17-19; Pl. Pet. 23-25.  They ask \nonly if it is \u201cfair\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d to \u201cassert\u201d personal \njurisdiction over Respondents.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 20-22; Pl. \nPet. 20, 24, 26.  The amici are similarly adamant in \nasking this Court to decide that question, rather than \naddressing consent.  Grassley Amicus Br. 17; House \nAmicus Br. 11; Sofaer Amicus Br. 3.  But that is not \nthe question presented by the PSJVTA, which is \nwhether Respondents can be constitutionally deemed \nto have consented to jurisdiction.  This Court should \n\n24 \n \n \nnot accept certiorari to decide if Congress has powers \nit did not purport to exercise.   \nThe court of appeals correctly considered the statute \non its own terms\u2014and through this Court\u2019s consent \ncases\u2014cases that Petitioners largely disregard.  \nPetitioners, instead, rely on minimum contacts cases \nlike Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 139 (2014), \nand Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, \n471-72 (1985).  Their reliance on hornbook minimum \ncontacts cases to establish the standard applicable to \nconsent \nunder \nthe \nPSJVTA \nhighlights \nthe \ninconsistency at the heart of their petitions.   \nPetitioners\u2019 theories also undermine this Court\u2019s \ndue process cases.  If Petitioners are correct, Congress \ncould circumvent those cases by enacting statutes \ndeclaring that the same activities already held \nconstitutionally insufficient to confer jurisdiction \nshall be deemed as consent.  Under Daimler, for \nexample, a California court could not exercise \njurisdiction over a foreign car manufacturer and its \nU.S. subsidiary, which distributed vehicles to \nCalifornia dealerships, but were incorporated and \nmaintained their principal places of business \nelsewhere.  571 U.S. at 139.  Despite achieving \n\u201csizable\u201d sales in the state, the Court held that \ndefendants\u2019 activities were insufficient for general \njurisdiction because they were not \u201cessentially at \nhome\u201d in the forum.  Id.  Under Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, \nCongress could declare that any foreign corporation \nthat distributed vehicles to California dealerships \n\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d in the state.   \n \n \n\n25 \n \n \nB. \nThe petitions fail to raise an issue of \nexceptional practical importance.   \nNot only do the decisions below have no legal \nimportance except to the parties, they also have no \nbroader practical importance.  The PSJVTA does not \napply to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State, or any \nother terrorist groups or state-sponsors of terrorism.  \nAs the Government concedes, the decisions apply only \nto two sui generis entities over which the courts have \nrepeatedly rejected personal jurisdiction.  The facts in \nthese cases also do not raise uniquely American \nconcerns.  Respondents are not headquartered here, \nand the attacks at issue were random attacks, not \naimed at Americans.   \nAs the Solicitor General explained earlier in this \ncase, \u201cnothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants \nunder the broader due process principles the courts \nhave recognized in cases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Resp. App. 24a.  The ATA still \u201cpermits \nU.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants \naccused of targeting U.S. citizens in an act of \ninternational terrorism\u201d or where \u201cthe United States \nwas the focal point of the harm caused by the \ndefendant\u2019s participation in or support for overseas \nterrorism.\u201d  Id.  The ATA also applies to defendants \n\u201cconducting activity in the United States, by, for \nexample, making use of U.S. financial institutions to \nsupport international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  The opinions \nbelow do not affect \u201ccases involving the application of \nU.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens \nor interests.\u201d  Id.  In sum, ATA jurisdiction is present \nwhere attacks are targeted at America or U.S. citizens, \nor are planned or financed in the United States.  \n\n26 \n \n \nThe political branches have a robust arsenal of \nantiterrorism tools unconstrained by the decisions \nbelow, including criminal prosecutions, sanctions, \nasset freezes, export controls, and the use of force.  \nCongress has recognized that ATA criminal cases \nmore directly advance the government\u2019s interests in \nantiterrorism law enforcement than their civil \ncounterparts.  See 138 Cong. Rec. S17254-01, S17260, \n1992 \nWL \n308152 \n(daily \ned. \nOct. \n7, \n1992); \nAntiterrorism Act of 1990: Hearing on S. 2465 Before \nthe S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st Cong. 46-47 \n(1990).  As such, \u201cadher[ence] to the status quo of \npersonal jurisdiction doctrine\u201d in civil ATA cases \n\u201cdo[es] not diminish any law-enforcement tools that \ncurrently exist.\u201d  Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  \nNor does the result below prevent Plaintiffs from \nbringing suit in an appropriate forum.  Israeli courts \nallow suits by Americans who are injured in Israel.  A \ncourt recently awarded damages against Respondents \nto two Americans injured in a 1985 PLF attack. 11  \nIsrael also allows large damage awards, including a \n$100 million award against Respondents for injuries \nduring the Second Intifada.12  Another Israeli court \nfound Respondents liable for welfare payments in \n \n11 JNS Wire, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to Achille Lauro \nHijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), https://www.jns.org/wire/plo-\nordered-to-pay-compensation-to-achille-lauro-hijacking-\nvictims/; Shurat Hadin, PLO Ordered to Pay Compensation to \n1985 Achille Lauro Hijacking Victims (July 26, 2021), \nhttps://israellawcenter.org/legal_actions/plo-ordered-to-pay-\ncompensation-to-1985-achille-lauro-hijacking-vicitms/.  \n12 Jerusalem Post, Terror victims\u2019 families to collect NIS 500 m. \nfrom Palestinian Authority (Apr. 26, 2020), https://www. \njpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/court-orders-collection-of-nis-500-\nm-from-pa-for-second-intifada-625930; \nNorz\u2019its \nLitbac \nv. \nPalestinian Auth.

This case is a poor vehicle to resolve the \nconstitutionality of the PSJVTA.  \nBoth Fuld and Sokolow have significant issues \npreventing this Court from providing the relief \nPlaintiffs seek.  Among other things, Petitioners\u2019 \nhands are tied by estoppel, waiver, and forfeiture.  As \na result, these cases are poor vehicles, especially since \nthe Court will have future opportunities to address \nthe PSJVTA in cases currently pending in other \ncircuits. \nA. \nThese cases face unique case-specific \nchallenges.   \n1.  The Fuld plaintiffs are estopped from obtaining \nrelief.  They pursued various defendants on \ninconsistent theories, claiming each was responsible \nfor the same attack.  But they recently secured a $191 \nmillion judgment on the basis that Iran and Syria \naided Hamas, which was \u201cthe terror organization that \ncarried out the attack.\u201d  Fuld v. Islamic Republic of \nIran, No. 20-2444, 2024 WL 1328790, *1, *4 (D.D.C. \nMar. 28, 2024).  The court accepted plaintiffs\u2019 position, \nholding the attacker was \u201crecruited to Hamas through \nhis high school,\u201d and the attack \u201cwas planned and \n \n13 Times of Israel, High Court: PA liable for terrorism due to \nmoney it pays attackers; victims can sue (Apr. 10, 2022), \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-pa-liable-for-\nterrorism-due-to-stipends-to-attackers-victims-can-sue/; \nAnon. \nv. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivA 2362/19 (Jerusalem 2022); \nMentin v. Palestinian Auth. (Isr.), CivC 3361/09 (Jerusalem \n2017). \n \n\n28 \n \n \ncarried out by the Al-Qassam Brigades\u2014the Hamas \nterrorist branch.\u201d  Id. at *4-6. \nThe plaintiffs also convinced the court that the \nattack was a stroke against Respondents\u2019 legitimacy, \nintended to mark \u201cthe 15th anniversary of the Oslo \nAccords\u2014an agreement Hamas seeks to eradicate.\u201d  \nId. at *5.  Respondents are the enemies and \u201cbitter \nrivals\u201d of Hamas, id. at *4, and were recognized or \nestablished by the Oslo Accords.  The attack, plaintiffs \nclaimed, was \u201cintended to protest against the security \ncooperation between Israel and Fatah and the \nPalestinian Authority.\u201d  Fuld v. Iran Doc. 27-3 at 50. \nGiven that successful position and resulting \njudgment, it would be illogical and inconsistent for \nPlaintiffs to also claim that Respondents were \nactually responsible for the attack.  New Hampshire v. \nMaine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (estoppel prohibits \n\u201cparties \nfrom \ndeliberately \nchanging \npositions \naccording to the exigencies of the moment\u201d). \n2.  Sokolow is also a poor vehicle.  Filed in 2004, it \nwent through discovery and a jury verdict, but was \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction in 2016.  \nAfter it became final, the Sokolow plaintiffs asked the \ncourt of appeals to recall its mandate.  The court, \nhowever, held in 2019 that its \u201cinterest in finality ... \nweighs against recalling the mandate.\u201d  Pet. App. 132-\n35a. \u201cRecalling the mandate now would offend \u2018the \nneed to preserve finality in judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d  Id.  \nIt noted the plaintiffs had another case that would be \nthe appropriate forum for litigating the PSJVTA.  Id. \nat 135a n.2.  More time has passed, and Sokolow has \nnow been final for eight years. \nBut even if Sokolow is resurrected, its jury verdict \ncannot be.  As explained in Burnham v. Superior Ct. \nof California, 495 U.S. 604, 608-09 (1990), the limited \nnature of the judicial power means that \u201cthe judgment \n\n29 \n \n \nof a court lacking jurisdiction is void.\u201d  Both \n\u201cproceedings\u201d \nand \n\u201cjudgments\u201d \nmade \nwithout \npersonal jurisdiction are \u201cnot simply erroneous, but \nabsolutely void.\u201d  Roman Cath. Archdiocese of San \nJuan v. Feliciano, 589 U.S. 57, 64 (2020) (cleaned up).  \nAnd even if this case were to survive, there are still \nissues remaining from the original appeal, including \nimproper expert testimony.  Pet. App. 141-42a; see \nGilmore v. Palestinian Auth., 843 F.3d 958, 972-73 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (affirming judgment for Respondents \nafter excluding one such expert\u2019s testimony).   \n3.  This Court will have multiple chances to accept \ncertiorari \nin \nthe future, \nbenefiting from \nthe \nperspectives of other circuits.  The Tenth Circuit case \nmentioned above is currently set for oral argument on \nNovember 19, 2024 (Nos. 23-1286, 23-1335), and \nanother PSJVTA case is pending in D.C. district court \n(No. 04-1173).    \nB. \nEver-changing theories of due process \nand original meaning create waiver \nproblems.  \nThe Petitioners also cannot avoid the results of their \nprior inconsistent positions.  Plaintiffs have forfeited \ntheir originalism arguments, and the Government \nproposes a new and different due process theory \nbefore this Court.  Plaintiffs\u2019 forfeited originalism \narguments remain, as might be expected, slapdash, \nunder-developed, and unready for this Court\u2019s review. \n1. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments about due process and \noriginal meaning were forfeited.  They did not raise \narguments about the original understanding at the \ntrial court level in either Fuld or Sokolow.  On appeal, \nonly the Fuld plaintiffs raised originalism, and they \ndid so only to argue for a \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cnexus\u201d standard \nunder the Fifth Amendment\u2014not the extreme due-\nprocess-does-not-include-jurisdiction approach found \n\n30 \n \n \nfor the first time in their petition.  See Fuld C.A. Pl. \nBr. Doc. 67 at 49, 61.  The Second Circuit, not \nsurprisingly given the forfeiture, did not address \noriginalism.  \nThis Court should decline to review Plaintiffs\u2019 new \noriginalism argument as it was doubly forfeited.  See \nOBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37 \n(2015) (\u201c[t]hat argument was never presented to any \nlower court and is therefore forfeited\u201d); Adams v. \nRobertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86 (1997) (dismissing \ncertiorari as improvidently granted when petitioners \nfailed the \u201cburden of showing that the issue was \nproperly presented\u201d below). \nThe Government has also significantly changed its \nposition on due process.  It successfully argued for the \nestablished \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d standard in both \ntrial and appellate courts.  See Fuld C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. \n73 at 21; Sokolow C.A. Gov\u2019t Br. Doc. 447 at 19.  Only \nafter losing under that very same standard did the \nGovernment begin to argue for the new fairness-only \napproach found in its Petition, where consent is just \none of the \u201cconsiderations.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Pet. 16, 21.  Below, \nthe Government argued for clear distinctions between \nconsent jurisdiction and imposed jurisdiction.  Fuld \nC.A. Gov\u2019t Reply Doc. 162 at 5.  Here, for the first time, \nthe Government proposes to replace longstanding due \nprocess standards for consent jurisdiction with the \n\u201cflexible\u201d \nbut \nentirely \ndifferent \nstandards \nfor \nprocedural due process.  Gov\u2019t Pet. 14, 20.   \n2.  The need for further development of Plaintiffs\u2019 \noriginalism arguments is reflected in the many errors \nin their petition.  Plaintiffs cite the Constitution\u2019s \nexpress grant of extraterritorial jurisdiction in \nadmiralty and maritime cases as evidence of \n\u201cextraterritorial power\u201d being a \u201cdeliberate feature of \nthe constitutional plan.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 16-17.  It is precisely \n\n31 \n \n \nthe opposite; the Constitution expressly confers \nextraterritorial jurisdiction in limited cases to the \nexclusion of others.  See The Federalist No. 80 (federal \njurisdiction extends to cases that \u201coriginate on the \nhigh seas, and are of admiralty or maritime \njurisdiction\u201d); Constit., Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 10; Art. III, \nSec. 2, cl. 1.  Had the Framers understood federal \njurisdiction to be unconstrained by national borders \nas Plaintiffs contend, these explicit provisions of \njurisdiction would be superfluous.   \nAccordingly, early scholars believed federal courts\u2019 \njurisdiction was circumscribed by \u201ca sovereign\u2019s power \n[which] was limited to activities occurring within its \nterritory.\u201d  Lea Brilmayer & Charles Norchi, Federal \nExtraterritoriality and Fifth Amendment Due Process, \n105 Harv. L. Rev. 1217, 1224-25 (1992); Joseph Story, \nCommentaries on the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 539 (1834) \n(\u201c[J]urisdiction, to be rightfully exercised, must be \nfounded either upon the person being within the \nterritory, or the thing being within the territory; for, \notherwise, there can be no sovereignty exerted.\u201d).  \nIndeed, \u201cleading writers on international law who \ninformed the Framers\u2019 views ... regarded universal \njurisdiction as aberrational or problematic.\u201d  Eugene \nKontorovich, The \u2018Define And Punish\u2019 Clause And The \nLimits Of Universal Jurisdiction, 103 Nw. U.L. Rev. \n149, 174 (2009).   \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, this Court has \ncontinually acknowledged limits on jurisdiction over \nforeign persons.  As early as 1808, Chief Justice \nMarshall recognized that \u201cthe legislation of every \ncountry is territorial; that beyond its own territory, it \ncan only affect its own subjects or citizens.\u201d  Rose v. \nHimely, 8 U.S. 241, 279 (1808); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 \nU.S. 264, 295 (1821) (\u201clegislative power has no \noperation, beyond the territorial limits under its \nauthority\u201d); see also Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, \n\n32 \n \n \n611-12 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (\u201c[N]o sovereignty can \nextend its process beyond its territorial limits, to \nsubject either persons or property to its judicial \ndecisions.\u201d).   \n\u201cThe jurisdiction of courts is a branch of that which \nis possessed by the nation as an independent \nsovereign power\u201d and that sovereignty is \u201cincapable of \nconferring extra-territorial power.\u201d  The Schooner \nExch. v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 136-37 (1812); The \nApollon, 22 U.S. 362, 370 (1824) (\u201cThe laws of no \nnation can justly extend beyond its own territories, \u2026 \nhowever general and comprehensive the phrases used \nin our municipal laws may be, they must always be \nrestricted in construction, to places and persons, upon \nwhom \nthe \nLegislature \nhave \nauthority \nand \njurisdiction.\u201d).  \nGuided by an academic, Plaintiffs erroneously \nclaim Justice Story held that \u201cthe federal courts\u201d \nwould be \u201cbound to follow\u201d any statute imposing \njurisdiction on anyone \u201cfrom the other end of the \nglobe.\u201d  Pl. Pet. 15, 19 (quoting Picquet).  But \u201c[e]ven \nunder the act of Congress, judgments must appear to \nbe rendered by courts having jurisdiction of the \nparties, as well as the cause.\u201d  Aspden v. Nixon, 45 \nU.S. 467, 484 (1846).  Picquet is not to the contrary, as \nit addressed Congress\u2019s power to allow a court to \nattach and execute on property within its territorial \njurisdiction.  19 F. Cas. at 615.  Picquet, in fact, \nrepeatedly warns that jurisdiction could not extend \noutside national boundaries.  Id. at 611 (\u201cEven the \ncourt of king\u2019s bench in England, though a court of \ngeneral jurisdiction, never imagined, that it could \nserve process in Scotland, Ireland, or the colonies, to \ncompel an appearance, or justify a judgment against \npersons residing therein at the time of the \ncommencement of the suit.\u201d).  \n\n33 \n \n \nPlaintiffs\u2019 loose approach to the Constitution and \nhistory underscores the need for further consideration \nof these issues in the lower courts.   \n \nC. \nPetitioners fail to address separation of \npowers.   \nThough these cases were resolved on due process \ngrounds, Respondents raised separation of powers at \nevery stage.  Petitioners fail to address this significant \nconstitutional roadblock.   \nCongress overstepped its constitutional authority \nwith the PSJVTA by attempting to \u201cusurp a court\u2019s \npower to interpret and apply the law to the \ncircumstances before it.\u201d  Bank Markazi v. Peterson, \n578 U.S. 212, 224-28 (2016) (cleaned up); United \nStates v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128, 147 (1871) (overturning \nstatute \nrequiring \ncourts \nto \ntreat \npardons \nof \nConfederate sympathizers as conclusive evidence of \ndisloyalty).  The PSJVTA usurps the judicial function \nby directing courts to always find consent if its factual \npredicates \nare \nmet\u2014regardless \nof \nwhether \nconstitutional standards for consent are satisfied.  \nDetermining the waiver of constitutional rights is a \nquintessentially \njudicial \nquestion, \nrequiring \n\u201capplication of constitutional principles to the facts as \nfound.\u201d  Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977).  \nThat is particularly so when consent to jurisdiction \nrequires a \u201cdeeply factbound analysis.\u201d  Wellness Int\u2019l, \n575 U.S. at 685-86. \nThe PSJVTA also violates the principle that \nCongress cannot \u201clegislatively supersede\u201d decisions \n\u201cinterpreting \nand \napplying \nthe \nConstitution.\u201d  \nDickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 437 (2000).  \nThe Second and D.C. Circuits previously held that \nfinding personal jurisdiction based on the same course \n\n34 \n \n \nof conduct alleged here violates due process.  \nPermitting Congress to supersede those holdings by \nre-labeling that conduct as \u201cconsent\u201d would violate \nseparation of powers.  See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 \nU.S. 507, 523-24 (1997) (rejecting Congressional effort \nto overturn precedent by creating a different \nconstitutional standard).  As one judge explained, \nCongress cannot take \u201cconduct that the Second and \nD.C. Circuits had held was insufficient to support \npersonal jurisdiction \u2026 and declare[] that such \nconduct \u2018shall be deemed\u2019 to be consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.  Pet.

In the view of the United States, \nthe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a.  Petitioners are United States citizens, and the \nguardians, family members, and personal representa-\ntives of the estates of United States citizens, who were \ninjured or killed in seven terrorist attacks in or near Je-\nrusalem.  Pet. App. 5a n.2.  In 2004, petitioners filed suit \nagainst respondents Palestinian Authority (PA) and \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA), which provides a \nright of action to United States nationals and their es-\ntates, survivors, or heirs for injuries caused by acts of \n7a\n                     (1)\n\n2 \n \ninternational terrorism. 18 U.S.C. 2333(a).  Respond-\nents moved to dismiss the claims for lack of personal ju-\nrisdiction.  See Pet. App. 5a.   \nThe district court denied respondents\u2019 motion, hold-\ning that it had general jurisdiction over respondents.  \nPet. App. 52a-74a.  The court framed the jurisdictional \ninquiry as \u201cwhether a defendant has minimum contacts \nwith the forum\u201d sufficient to justify maintenance of the \nsuit and \u201cwhether it would be reasonable, under the cir-\ncumstances of the particular case, to exercise jurisdic-\ntion over the defendant.\u201d  Id. at 60a.  The court reasoned \nthat respondents\u2019 \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d pres-\nence in the United States was sufficient to support gen-\neral jurisdiction, and that respondents could therefore \nbe sued in the United States on all claims, regardless of \nwhether the claims concerned respondents\u2019 conduct \nwithin the United States.  Id. at 61a.  The court empha-\nsized that respondents \u201cpurposely engaged in numer-\nous activities\u201d here, including commercial and public-\nrelations activities, and that respondents maintained an \noffice in Washington, D.C.  Id. at 62a; see id. at 63a-65a.  \nThe court also concluded that exercising personal juris-\ndiction over respondents was reasonable in light of \u201ctra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  Id. \nat 72a (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nRespondents moved for reconsideration after this \nCourt \u201csignificantly narrowed the general personal ju-\nrisdiction test in [Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. \n746 (2014)].\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.  The district court denied \nthe motion.  Id. at 75a-81a.  The court stated that re-\nspondents were effectively \u201cat home in the United \nStates\u201d because their activities here were \u201ccontinuous \nand systematic.\u201d  Id. at 77a.  And the court stated that \nit did not have \u201cany basis to believe\u201d that respondents \n8a\n\n3 \n \nwere engaged in more continuous or systematic activi-\nties in any other country.  Id. at 77a.  Respondents \nraised their jurisdictional arguments again in seeking \nsummary judgment.  Ibid. The court denied that mo-\ntion, rejecting respondents\u2019 argument that their con-\ntacts with the United States were insufficient to support \ngeneral jurisdiction under Daimler.  Id. at 82a-87a.   \nb. The district court permitted claims concerning six \nterrorist attacks to proceed to a jury trial.  Pet. App. 9a \nn.4.  Petitioners presented evidence linking respond-\nents to each of the attacks, id. at 9a-11a, 35a-36a, but \n\u201cdid not allege or submit evidence that [petitioners or \ntheir decedents] were targeted in any of the six attacks \nat issue because of their United States citizenship or \nthat [respondents] engaged in conduct in the United \nStates related to the attacks,\u201d id. at 15a.   \nThe jury found respondents civilly liable for the six \nattacks under several theories.  It concluded that, for all \nof the attacks, respondents had provided material sup-\nport or resources.  Pet. App. 35a.  It also concluded that, \nfor five of the attacks, respondents were responsible \nbased on respondeat-superior principles because a PA \npolice officer or other PA employee had either carried \nout the attack or provided material support or re-\nsources for the attack.  Ibid.  The jury further concluded \nthat, in connection with three of the attacks, respond-\nents knowingly provided material support to organiza-\ntions designated by the State Department as foreign \nterrorist organizations, and members of those organiza-\ntions carried out the attacks.  Id. at 36a.  Finally, the \njury concluded for one of the attacks that respondents \nhad harbored or concealed a person that they knew or \nhad reasonable grounds to believe was involved with the \nattacks.  Ibid.  The jury awarded petitioners damages \n9a\n\n4 \n \nof $218.5 million, which were increased to $655.5 million \nunder the ATA\u2019s treble-damages provision.  Id. at 6a; \nsee 18 U.S.C. 2333(a). \n2. The court of appeals vacated and remanded the \ncase to the district court with instructions to dismiss pe-\ntitioners\u2019 suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. \n1a-51a.   \nAs an initial matter, the court of appeals rejected pe-\ntitioners\u2019 argument that respondents have no due pro-\ncess rights because respondents \u201care foreign govern-\nments and share many of the attributes typically asso-\nciated with a sovereign government.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a; see \nid. at 19a-20a.  The court acknowledged that it had held \nthat \u201c[f\u200a]oreign sovereign states do not have due process \nrights,\u201d and instead enjoy the protections against suit \nafforded by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of \n1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1602 et seq.  Pet. App. 19a (citing \nFrontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the \nAzerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 398-401 (2d Cir. \n2009)).  But the court explained that \u201cneither the PLO \nnor the PA is recognized by the United States as a sov-\nereign state, and the executive\u2019s determination of such \nmatter is conclusive.\u201d  Id. at 20a (citing Zivotofsky v. \nKerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2088 (2015)).  The court noted \nthat petitioners had pointed to no decision \u201cindicating \nthat a non-sovereign entity with governmental attrib-\nutes lacks due process rights.\u201d  Id. at 19a-20a. \nThe court of appeals next turned to whether the ex-\nercise of personal jurisdiction over respondents was \nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  In analyzing that question, the court re-\njected petitioners\u2019 argument that the principles of gen-\neral and specific jurisdiction developed in the context of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause were \n10a\n\n5 \n \ninapplicable because the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cis \ngrounded in concepts of federalism [and] was intended \nto referee jurisdictional conflicts among the sovereign \nStates.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  The court explained that its \n\u201cprecedents clearly establish the congruence of due \nprocess analysis under both the Fourteenth and Fifth \nAmendments.\u201d  Id. at 22a.  The \u201cprincipal difference,\u201d \nthe court further explained, \u201cis that under the Fifth \nAmendment the court can consider the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts throughout the United States, while under the \nFourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the fo-\nrum state may be considered.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that it \u201cha[d] already applied Four-\nteenth Amendment principles to Fifth Amendment civil \nterrorism cases,\u201d among others.  Id. at 22a-23a (citing \nIn re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, \n673-674 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2870 \n(2014); In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 538 \nF.3d 71, 93 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 935 \n(2009); Texas Trading & Milling Corp. v. Federal Re-\npublic of Nigeria, 647 F.2d 300, 315 n.37 (2d Cir. 1981), \ncert. denied, 454 U.S. 1148 (1982)). \nApplying these principles, the court of appeals held \nthat the district court lacked general jurisdiction over \nrespondents.  Pet. App. 25a-32a.  It explained that \u201c[a] \ncourt may assert general personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant to hear any and all claims against that \ndefendant only when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with \nthe State in which suit is brought \u2018are so constant and \npervasive as to render [it] essentially at home in the fo-\nrum State.\u2019\u200a\u201d Id. at 24a (internal quotation marks omit-\nted; brackets in original) (quoting Daimler, 134  \nS. Ct. at 751).  The court concluded that \u201coverwhelming \nevidence\u201d showed that respondents were at home in the \n11a\n\n6 \n \nWest Bank and in Gaza.  Id. at 27a.  In contrast, re-\nspondents\u2019 activities in the United States were more \nlimited and resembled \u201cthose rejected as insufficient by \nthe Supreme Court in Daimler.\u201d  Id. at 28a. \nThe court of appeals also found respondents\u2019 con-\ntacts with the United States insufficient for purposes of \nspecific jurisdiction\u2014a question that petitioners had in-\nvited the court to address even though the district court \nhad not decided that issue.  Pet. App. 32a-50a; see Pet. \nC.A. Br. 32-33; see also Pet. App. 32a (finding specific \njurisdiction \u201csufficiently briefed and argued to allow \n[the court] to reach that issue\u201d).  The court concluded \nthat respondents\u2019 actions relating to the six terrorist at-\ntacks at issue did not create \u201ca substantial connection\u201d \nto the United States.  Pet. App. 32a (quoting Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014)).  \u201cWhile the plaintiff-\nvictims were United States citizens,\u201d id. at 33a, the \ncourt explained that the residence or citizenship of vic-\ntims alone \u201cis an insufficient basis for specific jurisdic-\ntion over the defendants,\u201d id. at 36a; see id. at 39a (dis-\ncussing Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1119).  The court also de-\ntermined that there was \u201cno basis to conclude that [re-\nspondents] participated in these acts in the United \nStates or that their liability for these acts resulted from \ntheir actions that did occur in the United States.\u201d  Id. at \n36a.  And it rejected petitioners\u2019 contention that re-\nspondents had aimed their conduct at the United States \nby targeting U.S. citizens, because it determined that \npetitioners\u2019 own evidence established that the attacks \nwere indiscriminate\u2014not targeted at Americans.  Id. at \n37a-39a; see id. at 45a.  The court contrasted petition-\ners\u2019 suit with previous ATA cases, which it noted had \ninvolved more extensive forum-related conduct.  Id. at \n40a-49a. \n12a\n\n7 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nPrivate actions under the Anti-Terrorism Act are an \nimportant means of fighting terrorism and providing re-\ndress for the victims of terrorist attacks and their fam-\nilies.  The court of appeals held here, however, that this \nparticular action is barred by constitutional constraints \non the exercise of personal jurisdiction because the dis-\ntrict court had neither general nor specific jurisdiction \nover respondents in this suit arising from overseas ter-\nrorist attacks.  Petitioners challenge that conclusion on \nthree grounds:  they argue that respondents lack any \nrights at all under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment (Pet. 22-27); in the alternative the court of \nappeals erred in applying principles of personal juris-\ndiction developed under the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to assess jurisdiction under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (Pet. \n27-30); and in any event the court of appeals erred in its \napplication of specific-jurisdiction principles to the facts \nof this case (Pet. 30-34).  The court of appeals\u2019 rejection \nof those arguments does not conflict with any decision \nof this Court, implicate any conflict among the courts of \nappeals, or otherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention \nat this time. \n1. The court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that respondents \nare entitled to due process protections does not warrant \nthis Court\u2019s review. \na. The court of appeals\u2019 determination does not con-\nflict with any decision of this Court.  The Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments prohibit the federal govern-\nment and the States, respectively, from depriving any \n\u201cperson\u201d of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due pro-\ncess of law.\u201d  U.S. Const. Amends. V, XIV.  Due process \n13a\n\n8 \n \nrequires that \u201cin order to subject a defendant to a judg-\nment in personam,\u201d the defendant must generally have \nsufficient \u201ccontacts with [the forum] such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional no-\ntions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted); see Insurance Corp. of \nIreland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,  \n456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982) (explaining that the require-\nments of personal jurisdiction flow \u201cfrom the Due Pro-\ncess Clause\u201d). \nBecause the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments \u201cspeak[] only of \u2018persons,\u2019\u200a\u201d \nLivnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 48 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (citation omitted), petition for cert. pending, No. \n17-508 (filed Sept. 28, 2017), whether an entity receives \ndue process protections depends on whether the entity \nqualifies as a \u201cperson.\u201d  This Court has recognized one \nclass of entities that are not \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \ndue process:  the States of the Union.  South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-324 (1966), abrogated \non other grounds by Shelby Cnty. v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. \n2612 (2013).  In reaching that result, the Court stated \nonly that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any \nreasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to en-\ncompass the States of the Union.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThis Court has not recognized any other class of  \nentities\u2014whether natural or artificial\u2014as outside the \ncategory of \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of due process.  It \nhas treated as \u201cpersons\u201d domestic and foreign entities \nof various types, such as corporations.  See, e.g., Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316-317 (domestic corpora-\ntion); Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746, 750-752 \n14a\n\n9 \n \n(2014) (German public stock company); Goodyear Dun-\nlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 918-\n920 (2011) (foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. tire manufac-\nturer).  Because this Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence has \nset only States of the Union outside of the category of \n\u201cpersons,\u201d this Court\u2019s decisions do not establish that \nforeign entities like respondents are barred from invok-\ning due process protections. \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s treatment of respondents as \nentities that receive due process protections also does \nnot conflict with any decision of another court of ap-\npeals.  In fact, the decision below accords with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Livnat, supra, which also held that \nthe PA is entitled to due process protections.  851 F.3d \nat 48, 50.  Livnat appears to be the only other appellate \ndecision addressing the legal status of non-sovereign \nforeign entities that exercise governmental power.1  In \nLivnat, the D.C. Circuit understood this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Katzenbach to reflect the principle that the term \n\u201cperson\u201d excludes \u201csovereigns\u201d\u2014an understanding that \nthe court saw as consistent with common usage.  Id. at \n50 (\u201c[I]n common usage, the term \u2018person\u2019 does not in-\nclude the sovereign.\u201d) (citation omitted).  After noting \nthe distinctive attributes of sovereign entities, the D.C. \nCircuit concluded that foreign non-sovereign govern-\nmental entities like respondents do not fall outside due \nprocess protections.  Id. at 50-52.  In addition, the D.C. \nCircuit rejected the argument that the PA is outside our \ndomestic structure of government, explaining that this \n                                                     \n1 The decisions of the D.C. Circuit and the court of appeals below \naccord with a substantial number of district court decisions conclud-\ning that one or both of respondents have due process rights in the \npersonal jurisdiction context.  See Livnat v. Palestinian Auth.,  \n82 F. Supp. 3d 19, 26 (D.D.C. 2015) (compiling cases). \n15a\n\n10 \n \nCourt had consistently \u201crejected the notion that \u2018alien\u2019 \nentities\u201d\u2014such as foreign corporations\u2014\u201care disquali-\nfied from due-process protection.\u201d  Id. at 50. \nPetitioners err in contending (Pet. 24-25) that the de-\ncision below conflicts with federal appellate decisions \naddressing the status of foreign sovereigns.  As peti-\ntioners note (Pet. 24), the Second and D.C. Circuits have \nheld that foreign sovereigns lack due process rights\u2014a \nquestion on which this Court reserved decision in Re-\npublic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 \n(1992) (assessing personal jurisdiction over Argentina \nunder specific-jurisdiction principles, while \u201c[a]ssum-\ning, without deciding, that a foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 \nfor purposes of the Due Process Clause\u201d).  See Frontera \nRes. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of the Azerbaijan \nRepublic, 582 F.3d 393, 399-400 (2d Cir. 2009); Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 95-100 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  But as noted above, the Sec-\nond and D.C. Circuits have recognized that the reason-\ning of those decisions is limited to sovereigns, and they \nhave held that non-sovereign foreign entities like re-\nspondents do receive due process protections.  Pet. App. \n19a-20a; see Livnat, 851 F.3d at 48, 50. \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion (Pet. 24), there is \nalso no conflict between the decision below and City of \nEast St. Louis v. Circuit Court for Twentieth Judicial \nCircuit, 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993), which indi-\ncated that municipalities lack due process rights.  As \nLivnat observed, City of East St. Louis rested on the \n\u201cprinciple that municipalities are creatures of a State \nand therefore lack any constitutional rights against the \nState.\u201d  851 F.3d at 53 (citing City of East St. Louis, 986 \nF.2d at 1144, and discussing cases cited therein, includ-\ning City of Newark v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 192, 196 \n16a\n\n11 \n \n(1923)).  That rationale does not extend to foreign enti-\nties like respondents.  The court of appeals\u2019 treatment \nof respondents as subject to due process protections \ntherefore does not implicate any conflict.2 \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 21) that this Court should \ndecide whether respondents are entitled to due process \nprotections in the absence of a conflict because the de-\ncision below may \u201cinterfere with the Executive\u2019s  \nforeign-affairs prerogatives.\u201d  In the view of the United \nStates, petitioners\u2019 approach poses a greater threat of \nsuch interference.  The power to recognize foreign gov-\nernments is exclusively vested in the President.  Zivo-\ntofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2086 (2015); see ibid. \n(\u201cRecognition is a topic on which the Nation must speak  \n. . .  with one voice.\u201d) (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The President\u2019s recognition of a for-\neign state \u201cis a \u2018formal acknowledgement\u2019 that a partic-\nular \u2018entity possesses the qualifications for statehood\u2019 \n                                                     \n2  Petitioners overread the United States\u2019 1988 brief in a case in \nwhich the Palestine Information Office (PIO) challenged an order \nissued by the State Department under the Foreign Missions Act,  \n22 U.S.C. 4301 et seq., and Article II directing the PIO\u2014an agent of \nthe PLO\u2014to cease operations.  See Pet. Reply Br. 7.  The govern-\nment\u2019s brief argued that the court of appeals should reject the \nPLO\u2019s claims of a First Amendment violation because sovereign en-\ntities lack constitutional rights and the PLO was asserting that it \nwas a sovereign entity.  See Pet. Reply App. 41a (\u201cForeign political \nentities such as the PLO, which purport to be sovereign entities, \nhave no constitutional rights.\u201d); id. at 45a (\u201cBecause the PLO pur-\nports to be an independent foreign entity, it has no constitutional \nrights.\u201d); see also id. at 57a (similarly rejecting procedural due pro-\ncess claim).  The government\u2019s argument rested on the incompati-\nbility of the PLO\u2019s assertion of sovereign status with its claim of \nFirst Amendment rights, not on an independent determination that \nthe PLO\u2019s governmental attributes rendered it the equivalent of a \nsovereign.   \n17a\n\n12 \n \nor \u2018that a particular regime is the effective government \nof a state,\u2019 \u201d Id. at 2084 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) \nof Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 203 \ncmt. a (1987))\u2014not merely a determination that the \nUnited States will \u201caccord [a government] certain ben-\nefits,\u201d Pet. 26.  An approach under which courts would \nassess the extent to which foreign entities operate as \n\u201cthe effective government of a state\u201d or \u201cpossess[] the \nqualifications for statehood,\u201d Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at \n2084 (citation omitted), risks judicial determinations at \nodds with Presidential determinations underlying rec-\nognition. \nc. The Court has not seen any need to revisit the \nscope of the term \u201cperson\u201d under the Due Process \nClauses since Katzenbach, and in any event this case \nwould not be an appropriate vehicle for doing so for two \nreasons.  First, petitioners\u2019 argument relies (Pet. 23-24) \non analogizing respondents to foreign sovereigns and \nmunicipalities, but this Court has not yet passed upon \nthe status of those entities for due process purposes.  \nSecond, because respondents are sui generis entities \nwith a unique relationship to the United States govern-\nment, a ruling on whether respondents have due pro-\ncess protections is unlikely to have broad utility in re-\nsolving future cases concerning other entities.

Reply Br. 11 (emphasis omit-\nted). \na. The court of appeals\u2019 rejection of petitioners\u2019 \nFifth Amendment theory does not conflict with any de-\ncision of this Court.  This Court has explained that due \nprocess requires \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d with the \nforum \u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not \noffend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  International Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting \nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  In cases \narising under the Fourteenth Amendment, principles of \ngeneral jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued for \nany conduct in a forum where their contacts are \u201cso \n\u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render them essen-\ntially at home.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919.  Principles \nof specific jurisdiction permit defendants to be sued in \na forum where they are not essentially at home if there \nis \u201can affiliation between the forum and the underlying \ncontroversy, principally [an] activity or an occurrence \nthat takes place in the forum State.\u201d  Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Superior Court, 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017) \n(brackets in original) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).  \nIn the context of an intentional tort, a court may exer-\ncise specific jurisdiction over a defendant who has \u201cex-\npressly aimed\u201d tortious actions at the forum\u2014including \nby committing a tortious act with \u201ckn[owledge] that the \nbrunt of th[e] injury would be felt\u201d there.  Calder v. \n19a\n\n14 \n \nJones, 465 U.S. 783, 789-790 (1984); see Walden v. \nFiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1123 (2014).  But a court may not \nexercise specific jurisdiction merely because a defend-\nant could foresee that his conduct would have some ef-\nfect in the forum.  Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-790. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s reliance on these principles de-\nveloped in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nassess the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 contacts under \nthe Fifth Amendment does not conflict with any deci-\nsion of this Court.  This Court has repeatedly reserved \nthe question whether the limitations on personal juris-\ndiction under the Fifth Amendment differ from the lim-\nitations under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bristol- \nMyers, 137 S. Ct. at 1783-1784; Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. \nv. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 (1987); see \nalso J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n885 (2011) (plurality opinion); Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 n.* (1987) (opinion of \nO\u2019Connor, J.).  Recent personal jurisdiction cases aris-\ning in federal district courts have not presented that \nquestion because \u201c[f]ederal courts ordinarily follow \nstate law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction \nover persons.\u201d  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 753; see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(k)(1)(A) (authorizing service of process on a \ndefendant \u201cwho is subject to the jurisdiction of a court \nof general jurisdiction in the state where the district \ncourt is located\u201d). \nb. The Second Circuit\u2019s approach to jurisdiction un-\nder the Fifth Amendment also does not conflict with any \ndecision of another court of appeals.  Statutes such as \nthe ATA present questions concerning Fifth Amend-\nment jurisdictional limitations because they contain na-\ntionwide service-of-process and venue provisions that \n20a\n\n15 \n \npermit a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over de-\nfendants who would not be subject to suit in the courts \nof the State in which the federal court is located.   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A) and (C) (authorizing service of \nprocess on a defendant who is not \u201csubject to the juris-\ndiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state \nwhere the district court is located\u201d if service is \u201cauthor-\nized by a federal statute\u201d); 18 U.S.C. 2334(a) (providing \nthat an ATA defendant \u201cmay be served in any district \nwhere the defendant resides, is found, or has an agent\u201d).   \nIn analyzing such statutes, courts of appeals gener-\nally have adapted Fourteenth Amendment jurisdic-\ntional principles to the Fifth Amendment context in the \nmanner that the court below did: by considering a de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the Nation as a whole, rather \nthan only contacts with a particular State, in deciding \nwhether the defendant had the contacts needed for per-\nsonal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Application to En-\nforce Admin. Subpoenas Duces Tecum of SEC, 87 F.3d \n413, 417 (10th Cir. 1996) (\u201cWhen the personal jurisdic-\ntion of a federal court is invoked based upon a federal \nstatute providing for nationwide or worldwide service, \nthe relevant inquiry is whether the respondent has had \nsufficient minimum contacts with the United States.\u201d); \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55.3  The decision below is consistent \n                                                     \n3  See also Pet. App. 22a; In re Federal Fountain, Inc., 165 F.3d \n600, 602 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc); United States SEC v. Carrillo, 115 \nF.3d 1540, 1543 (11th Cir. 1997); United Liberty Life Ins. Co. v. \nRyan, 985 F.2d 1320, 1330 (6th Cir. 1993); United Elec., Radio & \nMach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, \n1085-1086 (1st Cir. 1992); Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec.

Pet. App. 23a-50a.  \nPetitioners point to no decision adopting their far \nbroader \u201csovereign interests\u201d theory, under which the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process limitations are satisfied \nso long as the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct interfered with U.S. \nsovereign interests as set out in a federal statute, and \nthe defendant was validly served with process in the \nUnited States pursuant to a nationwide-service-of- \nprocess provision.\u201d  Pet. Reply Br. 11 (emphasis omit-\nted).  Indeed, the D.C. Circuit concluded that \u201c[n]o \ncourt has ever\u201d adopted such an argument.   Livnat, 851 \nF.3d at 54.4 \n                                                     \nSeveral courts also have suggested that if a defendant has suffi-\ncient contacts, a court must determine that \u201cthe plaintiff\u200a\u2019s choice of \nforum [is] fair and reasonable.\u201d  Peay v. BellSouth Med. Assistance \nPlan, 205 F.3d 1206, 1212 (10th Cir. 2000); see Republic of Panama \nv. BCCI Holdings (Lux.) S.A., 119 F.3d 935, 947 (11th Cir. 1997); \nsee also Livnat, 851 F.3d at 55 n.6 (noting that issue but declining \nto express a view).   \n4  The cases noted by an amicus curiae (House Amicus Br. 18 n.5) \nare not to the contrary.  In three of the decisions, a federal statute \nprovided for nationwide service of process, and the court held that \ndue process did not require the existence of minimum contacts with \nany single State under ordinary International Shoe analysis.  Klein \nv. Cornelius, 786 F.3d 1310, 1318-1319 (10th Cir. 2015) (rejecting \nTexas defendant\u2019s challenge to jurisdiction of federal court in Utah \nin receivership proceedings); Trustees of the Plumbers & Pipefitters \nNat\u2019l Pension Fund v. Plumbing Servs., Inc., 791 F.3d 436, 443-444 \n(4th Cir. 2015) (rejecting Alabama corporations\u2019 challenge to juris-\ndiction over an ERISA claim in federal court in Virginia, where the \nERISA plan was administered); Haile v. Henderson Nat\u2019l Bank, \n22a\n\n17 \n \nc. Review of petitioners\u2019 broad Fifth Amendment \narguments would be premature.  Few courts have had \nthe opportunity to consider such arguments.  And the \ncontours and implications of petitioners\u2019 jurisdictional \ntheory\u2014which turns on whether a defendant\u2019s conduct \n\u201cinterfered with U.S. sovereign interests as set out in a \nfederal statute,\u201d Pet. Reply Br. 11\u2014are not themselves \nwell developed.  Under these circumstances, further de-\nvelopment in the lower courts is likely to be useful be-\nfore this Court addresses arguments that the federal \ncourts may, in particular circumstances, exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over civil cases without regard to the \nprinciples of specific and general jurisdiction developed \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \nd. Review of petitioners\u2019 theory is not currently war-\nranted on the ground that application of Fourteenth \nAmendment-derived jurisdictional principles \u201cleaves \nthe [ATA] a practical nullity\u201d and \u201cwould bar most suits \nunder the Act based on overseas attacks.\u201d  Pet. 17.  It is \nfar from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 approach will \nforeclose many claims that would otherwise go forward \nin federal courts.  As the court of appeals explained, its \napproach permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants accused of targeting U.S. citizens in an \n                                                     \n657 F.2d 816, 820, 823-824 (6th Cir. 1981) (rejecting Alabama de-\nfendants\u2019 challenge to jurisdiction of federal court in Tennessee in \nreceivership proceeding), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 949 (1982).  The re-\nmaining decision similarly stated that aggregation of nationwide \ncontacts under the Fifth Amendment might be permissible when a \nstatute authorizes nationwide service of process, but it found no per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant because there was no ap-\nplicable statute of that kind.  Max Daetwyler Corp. v. R. Meyer, 762 \nF.2d 290, 294 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 980 (1985).  None of \nthe decisions adopted a standard similar to petitioners\u2019 \u201csovereign \ninterests\u201d theory. \n23a\n\n18 \n \nact of international terrorism.  Pet. App. 45a; see Mor-\nris v. Khadr, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1335-1336 (D. Utah \n2006).  It permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction if \nthe United States was the focal point of the harm caused \nby the defendant\u2019s participation in or support for over-\nseas terrorism.  See Pet. App. 40a (discussing Mwani v. \nBin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (attack on U.S. \nembassy)); id. at 41a-43a (discussing In re Terrorist At-\ntacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. 2013) \n(overseas provision of material support expressly aimed \nat the United States when terrorist organization was \nknown to be targeting the United States), cert. denied, \n134 S. Ct. 2870 (2014)).  And the court of appeals stated \nthat it would permit U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction \nover defendants alleged to have purposefully availed \nthemselves of the privilege of conducting activity in the \nUnited States, by, for example, making use of U.S. fi-\nnancial institutions to support international terrorism.  \nSee id. at 46a-47a (discussing Licci v. Lebanese Cana-\ndian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161 (2d Cir. 2013)).  In addi-\ntion, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into question \nthe United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defendants un-\nder the broader due process principles the courts have \nrecognized in cases involving the application of U.S. \ncriminal laws to conduct affecting U.S. citizens or inter-\nests.  See id. at 44a; accord Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56.  Un-\nder these circumstances, in the absence of any conflict \nor even a developed body of law addressing petitioners\u2019 \nrelatively novel theory, this Court\u2019s intervention is not \nwarranted. \n3. Finally, certiorari is not warranted to address the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 factbound application of established \nspecific-jurisdiction principles.  See Pet. 30-34.  As a \n24a\n\n19 \n \nthreshold matter, the court of appeals correctly identi-\nfied those principles.  The court analyzed whether \u201cthe \ndefendant\u2019s suit-related conduct  * * *  create[d] a sub-\nstantial connection with the forum State.\u201d  Pet. App. 32a \n(quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121); see id. at 33a \n(framing the inquiry as \u201cwhether the defendants\u2019 suit-\nrelated conduct\u2014their role in the six terror attacks at \nissue\u2014creates a substantial connection with the forum \nState pursuant to the ATA\u201d).  Petitioners misread the \ndecision below as holding that petitioners could estab-\nlish specific jurisdiction only if respondents \u201c\u200a\u2018specifi-\ncally targeted\u2019 U.S. citizens or territory.\u201d  Pet. Reply \nBr. 11 (quoting Pet. App. 45a).  The court of appeals \nstated that respondents had not \u201cspecifically targeted \nUnited States citizens,\u201d Pet. App. 45a, in distinguishing \ntwo cases invoked by petitioners, in which the defend-\nants were accused of providing material support or fi-\nnancing to terrorist organizations whose \u201cspecific aim\u201d \nwas to \u201ctarget[] the United States,\u201d or to \u201ckill Ameri-\ncans and destroy U.S. property,\u201d id. at 42a, 45a (cita-\ntions omitted); see id. at 42a-45a (discussing In re Ter-\nrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659 (2d Cir. \n2013); United States v. al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. \n2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 986 (2012)).  But the court \nof appeals recognized that specific jurisdiction may ex-\nist when \u201cthe brunt\u201d or \u201cthe focal point\u201d of the harm \nfrom an intentional tort is felt in the forum State.  Id. at \n43a (quoting Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  The court found \npetitioners\u2019 claims did not meet that standard because \nIsrael, not the United States, was \u201cthe focal point of the \ntorts alleged in this litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nPetitioners\u2019 remaining disagreements with the deci-\nsion below amount to disagreements about what peti-\ntioners\u2019 evidence established.  Petitioners argue (Pet. \n25a\n\n20 \n \n31-32) that the court erred in applying principles of spe-\ncific jurisdiction because, in petitioners\u2019 view, respond-\nents expressly aimed their conduct at the United States.  \nBut the court of appeals found that the record did not \nestablish that proposition.  Rather, the court concluded, \npetitioners\u2019 \u201cown evidence establishe[d] the random \nand fortuitous nature of the terror attacks.\u201d  Pet. App. \n38a.  And it observed that it is \u201cinsufficient to rely on a \ndefendant\u2019s \u2018random, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201cwith the forum to establish specific jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d  Id. at 37a (quoting Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1123).   \nPetitioners similarly argue that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s verdict \nestablishes that respondents intended\u201d to influence \nUnited States policy, because the ATA reaches only \u201cvi-\nolent acts that \u2018appear intended\u2019 either \u2018to influence the \npolicy of a government by intimidation or coercion,\u2019 \u2018to \naffect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, \nassassination, or kidnapping,\u2019 or \u2018to intimidate or coerce \na civilian population.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. 31-32 (citation omitted).  \nBut the ATA covers attacks intended to influence for-\neign governments, such as Israel, as well as attacks that \nare intended (or appear intended) to influence the \nUnited States.  As a result, the jury\u2019s verdict does not \ndemonstrate that the court of appeals erred in applying \nprinciples of specific jurisdiction to the record in this case. \nIn any event, a fact-intensive dispute regarding the rec-\nord in this case does not warrant this Court\u2019s review. \n26a\n\n21 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \nJENNIFER G.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape in this case, previously based on the petitioners' arguments and the respondents' Brief in Opposition (BIO), remains intact but is now contextualized by a crucial piece of meta-information. The latest observation clarifies that my knowledge of the respondents' position is derived from a preliminary document (the BIO), not their final, comprehensive merits brief. This does not invalidate my prior beliefs but reframes them as a strategic outline rather than the complete argument.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n*   **Beliefs are Provisional Pending Merits Brief:** My core understanding of the respondents' defense strategy, as outlined in the BIO, is stable. However, I now recognize these arguments as a preview. The full merits brief is the most critical missing piece of evidence, and its analysis is required to confirm, deepen, or modify these initial beliefs.\n\n*   **Core Arguments Remain Stable but Preliminary:** The arguments I previously identified from the BIO continue to form the foundation of my understanding of the respondents' case. I now hold these beliefs with the caveat that the merits brief will provide greater detail, nuance, and potentially new lines of reasoning. The stable, but preliminary, arguments are:\n    *   **Distinguishing *Mallory* (The \"Narrow Path\" Defense):** The respondents' primary counter is the \"no quid pro quo\" argument. They contend that consent-by-registration statutes are valid because a defendant receives a benefit (doing business) in exchange for submitting to jurisdiction. The Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), they argue, lacks this essential exchange, as the conduct triggering \"consent\" (e.g., payments abroad) is not tied to any privilege granted by the U.S. They frame the PSJVTA as an unconstitutional \"legislative fiction\" that attempts to bypass the factual due process inquiry.\n    *   **Countering Fifth Amendment Deference (The \"Broad Path\" Defense):** The respondents have a two-pronged attack here. First, the procedural argument that the petitioners *forfeited* this broad constitutional theory by not properly raising it in lower courts, offering the Supreme Court an off-ramp. Second, the substantive argument that this theory is radical, unsupported by precedent, and contradicted by the U.S. government's own prior statements in this litigation.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments:** The respondents have also flagged potential non-merits reasons for the Court to rule in their favor, including parallel litigation, finality issues with a related case, and the lack of a circuit split, suggesting the issue should \"percolate\" further.\n\n*   **Refined Understanding of Uncertainty:** My uncertainty has shifted. Previously, it was about how the Court would weigh the known arguments against each other. Now, a more fundamental uncertainty has been introduced: the full and final content of the respondents' arguments. While the BIO provides a strong signal, the merits brief could contain more persuasive historical analysis, new supporting precedents, or a strategic shift in emphasis that could alter the calculus of the case. My confidence in any prediction is necessarily tempered until this gap in evidence is filled. The legal battlefield map I had constructed is accurate, but I now realize it may be missing key topographical details that the merits brief will supply.",

          "task_beliefs": "My previous belief that my understanding of the respondents' case was provisional, pending a full merits brief, has been significantly updated. The new observation\u2014a search for a \"merits brief\" returning the \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO)\u2014clarifies that the BIO is the definitive and complete articulation of the respondents' arguments at the certiorari stage. This resolves a major source of uncertainty. My beliefs are no longer provisional; they are now a confirmed analysis of the respondents' strategy to persuade the Court not to grant certiorari.\n\nMy updated beliefs, which build upon and refine my prior understanding, are as follows:\n\n*   **Confirmed Core Arguments (No Longer Provisional):** The arguments I previously identified from the BIO are now confirmed as the central pillars of the respondents' case for denying certiorari. My confidence in this framework is high, as the BIO is the primary strategic document at this juncture. The arguments are:\n    *   **The \"Faithful Application\" Defense (Distinguishing *Mallory*):** The respondents frame the Second Circuit's decision not as a radical departure, but as a \"straightforward application\" of this Court's precedents, primarily *Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee* and *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* They argue that consent to jurisdiction must be knowing and voluntary, and cannot be a \"legislative fiction\" imposed by Congress. The key distinction from *Mallory* is the lack of a *quid pro quo*; unlike a company that registers to do business in a state (receiving a benefit), the respondents receive no privilege from the U.S. in exchange for the conduct that the PSJVTA \"deems\" as consent.\n    *   **The \"Forfeiture\" Defense (Countering the Fifth Amendment Theory):** The respondents' primary response to the petitioners' broad Fifth Amendment theory is procedural. They assert that both the private petitioners and the U.S. Government *forfeited* this argument by failing to raise it properly in the lower courts. This provides the Supreme Court with a procedural \"off-ramp\" to avoid deciding the constitutional question, a tool the Court often uses. They cite *Adams v. Robertson* to support this \"pass-below\" rule.\n    *   **Highlighting Inconsistency:** A powerful new detail is the respondents' use of the U.S. government's own prior statements against it. They attach and reference the government's 2018 brief in *Sokolow v. PLO* (No. 16-1071), where the government advised the Court *against* granting certiorari on similar Fifth Amendment grounds, calling the theory \"not [] well developed.\" This is a strong signal of inconsistency that the Court may find persuasive.\n\n*   **Elevated Importance of \"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments:** I now understand that the arguments against granting certiorari are not secondary but are central to the respondents' strategy. The BIO is explicitly structured as \"REASONS TO DENY THE PETITIONS.\" The most critical of these are:\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** The respondents state directly that there is no disagreement among the circuit courts on this issue. In fact, they highlight that every court to consider the PSJVTA has found it unconstitutional. They suggest the Court should let the issue \"percolate\" further, as similar cases are pending in the D.C. and Tenth Circuits.\n    *   **Case-Specific Flaws:** The case is a \"poor vehicle\" due to unique factual and procedural problems, including: (1) the *Fuld* plaintiffs have already secured a judgment against Hamas based on an \"inconsistent theory\" for the same attack, and (2) the *Sokolow* case faces significant finality issues after eight years.\n    *   **Separation of Powers Concerns:** The respondents subtly introduce a separation of powers argument, suggesting that by \"deeming\" consent, Congress is unconstitutionally dictating a factual finding to the judiciary, in violation of principles from cases like *United States v. Klein*.\n\n*   **Resolved Uncertainty and Prediction Focus:** My primary uncertainty about a missing \"merits brief\" is now resolved. The legal battlefield for the certiorari decision is fully mapped. My predictive focus must now shift from how the Court might rule on the ultimate merits to the antecedent question of whether it will grant certiorari at all. The strength of the respondents' \"poor vehicle\" and \"no circuit split\" arguments significantly increases the probability that the Court could deny the petition, regardless of the underlying constitutional merits.",

It is a procedural null result that does not alter my understanding of the legal arguments, strategic positioning, or relevant facts. Therefore, my beliefs remain stable and are a direct carryover from my previous update.\n\nMy current, stable beliefs are:\n\n*   **Confirmed Respondents' Strategy (Certiorari Stage):** My analysis is no longer provisional. The Brief in Opposition (BIO) is the definitive document outlining the respondents' strategy to prevent the Court from hearing the case. My confidence is high that their approach is built on the following pillars:\n    *   **Distinguishing Precedent (\"Faithful Application\"):** The respondents argue the Second Circuit correctly applied *Insurance Corp. of Ireland* and *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* They contend that the PSJVTA creates a \"legislative fiction\" of consent, unlike the *quid pro quo* in *Mallory* where a company registers to do business in exchange for a state benefit. This frames the lower court's ruling as mainstream, not radical.\n    *   **Procedural Defenses (\"Forfeiture\"):** A key defensive tactic is to argue that the petitioners and the U.S. Government *forfeited* their current Fifth Amendment theory by not properly raising it in the lower courts. This offers the Supreme Court a procedural \"off-ramp\" to avoid the constitutional question, citing the \"pass-below\" rule from *Adams v. Robertson*.\n    *   **Highlighting Governmental Inconsistency:** The respondents effectively weaponize the U.S. government's own past statements, referencing a 2018 brief in *Sokolow v. PLO* where the government itself called the Fifth Amendment theory \"not [] well developed\" and advised against granting certiorari. This inconsistency is a powerful signal to the Court.\n\n*   **Centrality of \"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments:** The BIO is explicitly structured to argue against granting the petition. The most significant reasons provided are:\n    *   **No Circuit Split:** The respondents assert there is no disagreement among the circuits on this issue, noting that every court to consider the PSJVTA has found it unconstitutional.

Klein*.\n\n*   **Prediction Focus and Lingering Gaps:** My primary uncertainty about a missing merits brief has been resolved. The legal battlefield for the *certiorari decision* is now clear. My predictive focus has shifted from the ultimate merits of the Fifth Amendment question to the antecedent question of whether the Court will grant certiorari at all. The strength of the respondents' procedural and \"poor vehicle\" arguments significantly increases the probability of a denial. The failed search for the petitioners' brief simply re-confirms that while my understanding of the respondents' case is solid, my direct knowledge of the petitioners' framing of the issues in their own words remains a gap to be filled.",

Klein*.\n\n*   **Petitioners' Position (Newly Confirmed Existence):** My previous belief state noted a significant gap: \"my direct knowledge of the petitioners' framing of the issues in their own words remains a gap to be filled.\" The new observation directly addresses this. I can now confirm that the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has been filed by the petitioners**. While this observation does not reveal the *substantive arguments* within the 8,855-word document, it confirms that the petitioners are actively and formally seeking Supreme Court review. This is a critical procedural fact that moves the case forward and confirms the existence of the primary document outlining the petitioners' case for why the Court *should* hear the case.\n\n*   **Prediction Focus:** My predictive focus remains on the immediate question of whether the Court will grant certiorari. The confirmation of the petition's filing is a necessary procedural step for a potential grant, but it does not, in itself, alter the odds. The strength of the respondents' \"poor vehicle\" and procedural arguments remains a significant hurdle for the petitioners. My next critical step is to analyze the contents of this newly identified petition to understand how the petitioners counter the respondents' arguments and frame the importance of the legal question for the Court.

My posterior belief about the likelihood of a cert grant will shift dramatically based on the strength of the petition's arguments.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action provides a perfect, concrete data point for a core principle of SCOTUS prediction: analyzing the dialectic between the petition and the opposition. It moves beyond the abstract heuristic of 'read both sides' and allows me to model the specific interplay of arguments in a high-stakes constitutional case involving foreign relations and due process. This will refine my internal model for how the Court weighs competing cert-stage factors, such as national importance versus procedural defects.",

However, the design beliefs are absent or minimal, indicating very low meta-level strategic reasoning (0.15). The beliefs are internally consistent, well-integrated, and logically structured, justifying a high coherence score (0.9).

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA by \nenacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the Pal-\nestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay any terrorist convicted of or killed \nwhile committing a terror attack against an American \nnational, and the payment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \nconviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); \nor  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the trigger dates. But in the decisions below, \nthe Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. The \ncourt held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Congress \nfrom specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s con-\nsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides the \ndefendant with some \u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return, \nand that the PLO and PA had not received such a benefit.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n\n \n \n (II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, who were plaintiffs-appellants below, \nare: Mark I.

The court\u2019s order denying rehearing in banc (App. \n204a-268a) is reported at 101 F.4th 190. Earlier opinions \nof the court of appeals in Waldman (App. 126a-182a) are \nreported at 835 F.3d 317 and 925 F.3d 570. Opinions of the \ndistrict court (App. 71a-125a) are reported at 578 F. Supp. \n3d 577 (Fuld), 590 F. Supp. 3d 589 (Sokolow), and 607 F. \nSupp. 3d 323 (Sokolow).1 Other opinions of the district \ncourt (App. 183a-203a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment and order \non September 8, 2023, and denied timely rehearing peti-\ntions on May 10, 2024. App. 204a-268a. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. App. 307a-317a. \n \n \n \n1 The Sokolow case was captioned in the Second Circuit as Waldman \nv. Palestine Liberation Organization. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, \nJudge Menashi (joined by Chief Judge Livingston and \nJudges Sullivan and Park) identified this case as one of \n\u201cexceptional importance.\u201d App. 232a. To start, the Second \nCircuit facially invalidated a federal statute as unconstitu-\ntional. That step, \u201con its own,\u201d warrants immediate re-\nview. Id. at 233a. \nBut the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) is not just any federal \nstatute. It was enacted by Congress, in direct response to \nlower-court decisions in this case, for the express purpose \nof ensuring the courthouse door did not close on American \nvictims of international terrorism. Under the PSJVTA, \nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Pales-\ntinian Authority (PA) are deemed to consent to jurisdic-\ntion in cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) if, fol-\nlowing specified trigger dates, they pay financial rewards \nto terrorists for killing or injuring Americans or they en-\ngage in any activity in the United States (with certain ex-\nceptions). The political branches determined that this \nstatute serves vital national interests in disrupting and \ndeterring terrorism, compensating American terror vic-\ntims, and promoting peace in the Middle East.  \nThe ruling below not only renders the ATA a dead let-\nter in its heartland application, but it also severely re-\nstricts the power of Congress to provide for jurisdiction \nover any extraterritorial events. In short, the Second Cir-\ncuit hamstrung Congress on matters involving foreign af-\nfairs and national security. \nThat decision is more than dangerous; it is flat wrong. \nIt disregards the original public meaning of the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, instead applying to \nthe federal government the territorial limitations on state \njurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment. As Judge \n\n3 \n \n \nOldham explained when this issue was before the Fifth \nCircuit, \u201cI do not understand how or why we\u2019d take an un-\noriginalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, \npull it back in time to 1791, and use it to blind ourselves to \nan originalist interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d \nDouglass v. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 285 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (dissenting).  \nBut the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis would be wrong \neven under Fourteenth Amendment standards. It ignored \nthis Court\u2019s instruction that an exercise of personal juris-\ndiction satisfies due process if the defendant received \n\u201cfair warning\u201d that \u201ca particular activity may subject \nthem to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d and if the \nexercise of jurisdiction is \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. \nDist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358-359 (2021) (quotation marks \nomitted). As the Second Circuit acknowledged, App. 30a, \nthe PSJVTA indisputably satisfies those \u201cbasic principles \nof due process\u201d: It provides clear warning about exactly \nwhat conduct will give rise to jurisdiction in exactly what \nkinds of cases; and it advances the federal government\u2019s \nlegitimate interests in deterring and disrupting terror-\nism, protecting Americans, and ending the PLO and PA\u2019s \ninstitutionalized practice of promoting terrorism using fi-\nnancial rewards. \nThe decision below also conflicts with this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions on deemed-consent statutes, most prominently \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). In Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it \nhad \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction when it engaged \nin the consent-triggering conduct specified by statute, de-\nspite \u201cappreciat[ing] the jurisdictional consequences\u201d of \ndoing so. Id. at 144 (plurality). This Court rejected the de-\nfendant\u2019s argument, since \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 \n\n4 \n \n \nattach jurisdictional consequences to what some might \ndismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145.  \nInstead of following Mallory, the Second Circuit in-\nvented a new \u201creciprocity\u201d test, under which a deemed-\nconsent statute is valid only if the defendant receives a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return for submitting to juris-\ndiction. App. 38a. The Second Circuit created this test for \nthe supposed purpose of ensuring that the consent-mani-\nfesting conduct is a sufficiently close \u201cproxy for actual \nconsent\u201d (ibid.)\u2014the very concept this Court rejected in \nMallory. \nThe Second Circuit then misapplied its newly created \ntest by holding that a defendant receives no \u201cbenefit\u201d if \nthe defendant\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct is unlaw-\nful. As Judge Menashi put it, that is simply \u201cperverse.\u201d \nApp. 231a. A defendant who \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from \nthe forum without permission to do so should get lesser \nprotection from having to face a trial on the merits in the \nforum\u2019s courts, not greater. App. 232a.  \nThis Court\u2019s immediate intervention is needed. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The ATA provides a private right of action to U.S. \nnationals and their families to recover for death and inju-\nries sustained by reason of an act of international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired by a civil \nsuit brought against the PLO for the murder of Leon \nKlinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American cruise ship \npassenger who was shot in the face and thrown into the \nsea by PLO hijackers.  \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family held the PLO accountable for the \nmurder by invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction. \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992). The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee explained that the ATA would \u201copen[] the \n\n5 \n \n \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA by \nenacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the Pal-\nestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay any terrorist convicted of or killed \nwhile committing a terror attack against an American \nnational, and the payment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \nconviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); \nor  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the trigger dates. But in the decisions below, \nthe Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. The \ncourt held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Congress \nfrom specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s con-\nsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides the \ndefendant with some \u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return, \nand that the PLO and PA had not received such a benefit.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n\n \n \n (II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners, who were plaintiffs-appellants below, \nare: Mark I.

App. 204a-268a. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. App. 307a-317a. \n \n \n \n1 The Sokolow case was captioned in the Second Circuit as Waldman \nv. Palestine Liberation Organization. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nDissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, \nJudge Menashi (joined by Chief Judge Livingston and \nJudges Sullivan and Park) identified this case as one of \n\u201cexceptional importance.\u201d App. 232a. To start, the Second \nCircuit facially invalidated a federal statute as unconstitu-\ntional. That step, \u201con its own,\u201d warrants immediate re-\nview. Id. at 233a. \nBut the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) is not just any federal \nstatute. It was enacted by Congress, in direct response to \nlower-court decisions in this case, for the express purpose \nof ensuring the courthouse door did not close on American \nvictims of international terrorism. Under the PSJVTA, \nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and Pales-\ntinian Authority (PA) are deemed to consent to jurisdic-\ntion in cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) if, fol-\nlowing specified trigger dates, they pay financial rewards \nto terrorists for killing or injuring Americans or they en-\ngage in any activity in the United States (with certain ex-\nceptions). The political branches determined that this \nstatute serves vital national interests in disrupting and \ndeterring terrorism, compensating American terror vic-\ntims, and promoting peace in the Middle East.  \nThe ruling below not only renders the ATA a dead let-\nter in its heartland application, but it also severely re-\nstricts the power of Congress to provide for jurisdiction \nover any extraterritorial events. In short, the Second Cir-\ncuit hamstrung Congress on matters involving foreign af-\nfairs and national security. \nThat decision is more than dangerous; it is flat wrong. \nIt disregards the original public meaning of the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, instead applying to \nthe federal government the territorial limitations on state \njurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amendment. As Judge \n\n3 \n \n \nOldham explained when this issue was before the Fifth \nCircuit, \u201cI do not understand how or why we\u2019d take an un-\noriginalist interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, \npull it back in time to 1791, and use it to blind ourselves to \nan originalist interpretation of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d \nDouglass v. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 285 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (dissenting).  \nBut the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis would be wrong \neven under Fourteenth Amendment standards. It ignored \nthis Court\u2019s instruction that an exercise of personal juris-\ndiction satisfies due process if the defendant received \n\u201cfair warning\u201d that \u201ca particular activity may subject \nthem to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d and if the \nexercise of jurisdiction is \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. \nDist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358-359 (2021) (quotation marks \nomitted). As the Second Circuit acknowledged, App. 30a, \nthe PSJVTA indisputably satisfies those \u201cbasic principles \nof due process\u201d: It provides clear warning about exactly \nwhat conduct will give rise to jurisdiction in exactly what \nkinds of cases; and it advances the federal government\u2019s \nlegitimate interests in deterring and disrupting terror-\nism, protecting Americans, and ending the PLO and PA\u2019s \ninstitutionalized practice of promoting terrorism using fi-\nnancial rewards. \nThe decision below also conflicts with this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions on deemed-consent statutes, most prominently \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). In Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it \nhad \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction when it engaged \nin the consent-triggering conduct specified by statute, de-\nspite \u201cappreciat[ing] the jurisdictional consequences\u201d of \ndoing so. Id. at 144 (plurality). This Court rejected the de-\nfendant\u2019s argument, since \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 \n\n4 \n \n \nattach jurisdictional consequences to what some might \ndismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145.  \nInstead of following Mallory, the Second Circuit in-\nvented a new \u201creciprocity\u201d test, under which a deemed-\nconsent statute is valid only if the defendant receives a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d in return for submitting to juris-\ndiction. App. 38a. The Second Circuit created this test for \nthe supposed purpose of ensuring that the consent-mani-\nfesting conduct is a sufficiently close \u201cproxy for actual \nconsent\u201d (ibid.)\u2014the very concept this Court rejected in \nMallory. \nThe Second Circuit then misapplied its newly created \ntest by holding that a defendant receives no \u201cbenefit\u201d if \nthe defendant\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct is unlaw-\nful. As Judge Menashi put it, that is simply \u201cperverse.\u201d \nApp. 231a. A defendant who \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from \nthe forum without permission to do so should get lesser \nprotection from having to face a trial on the merits in the \nforum\u2019s courts, not greater. App. 232a.  \nThis Court\u2019s immediate intervention is needed. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The ATA provides a private right of action to U.S. \nnationals and their families to recover for death and inju-\nries sustained by reason of an act of international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired by a civil \nsuit brought against the PLO for the murder of Leon \nKlinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American cruise ship \npassenger who was shot in the face and thrown into the \nsea by PLO hijackers.  \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family held the PLO accountable for the \nmurder by invoking federal admiralty jurisdiction. \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992). The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee explained that the ATA would \u201copen[] the \n\n5 \n \n \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil \nATA cases based on their systematic and continuous pres-\nence in the United States. App. 193a n.10 (collecting \ncases). In 2016, however, the Second Circuit held that U.S. \ncourts could no longer do so because this Court had \u201cnar-\nrowed the test for general jurisdiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. \nBauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). App. 141a. It also found \nspecific jurisdiction over the PLO and PA absent because \nthe \u201cconduct that could have subjected them to liability \nunder the ATA\u201d had occurred \u201coutside the United \nStates.\u201d App. 166a. \n2. Congress responded to the decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked a traditional basis for the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any defend-\nant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates from \nmaintaining an office or spending money in the United \nStates\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant maintains \n\u201cany office within the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d \nafter January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the date of the oc-\ncurrence of the act of international terrorism.\u201d Pub. L. \nNo. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183-3185 (formerly codified at 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)). The House Judiciary Committee \n\n6 \n \n \nexplained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to condition\u201d the \nPLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the United States \non [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Congress has re-\npeatedly tied their continued receipt of these privileges to \ntheir adherence to their commitment to renounce terror-\nism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018).  \nIn response to another Second Circuit ruling in this \ncase, which held that the ATCA\u2019s factual predicates had \nnot been met, App. 29a-30a, Congress amended the ATCA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)). The PSJVTA \nhas two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the law\u2019s \nenactment, the defendant makes any payment to a de-\nsignee of an individual imprisoned for, or killed while, \ncommitting a terror attack that killed or injured a na-\ntional of the United States, if the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorist\u2019s death or imprisonment. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A).  \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after enactment, \nthe defendant \u201cconducts any activity while physically \npresent in the United States on behalf of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization or the Palestinian Author-\nity.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to six exceptions, \nincluding maintaining an office or conducting an activ-\nity \u201cexclusively for the purpose of conducting official \nbusiness of the United Nations.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), \n(B). \n\n7 \n \n \nCongress instructed that the statute must be \u201cliberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \nThese cases arose out of a series of terror attacks in \nIsrael that killed or injured U.S. nationals. Officials and \nemployees of the PLO and PA planned, directed, and par-\nticipated in these attacks. \n1. The Sokolow case was brought by American fam-\nilies victimized in terror attacks in Israel between 2001 \nand 2004. Mark Sokolow and his family were on vacation \nin Jerusalem, buying a pair of shoes for their twelve-year-\nold daughter when a PA intelligence agent detonated a 22-\npound bomb in her backpack, killing one and injuring the \nSokolows and more than 100 others. Alan Bauer and his \nseven-year-old son were walking down a crowded street \nwhen a suicide bomber blew himself up at the direction of \na PA security officer, sending shrapnel into the father\u2019s \narm and the boy\u2019s brain. Scott Goldberg was killed on his \nway to work when a PA police officer detonated himself \non a local bus; Goldberg left a widow and seven children. \nFour other plaintiffs died when a massive bomb went off \nin a university cafeteria at lunchtime; their parents \nlearned about their deaths at home in the United States\u2014\nsome by recognizing their children\u2019s bodies or personal \neffects on the news. \nThe Fuld case was brought by the family of Ari Fuld, \nan American citizen and father of four. In September \n2018, Mahmoud Abbas, the Chairman of the PLO and \nPresident of the PA, falsely announced that the Govern-\nment of Israel was planning to establish special Jewish \nprayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam\u2019s \nholiest sites. C.A. Doc. 66, at A47-49, Case No. 22-76 (2d \nCir. 2023). Hours later, a Palestinian terrorist, incited by \n\n8 \n \n \nAbbas\u2019s false accusations, stabbed Mr. Fuld to death out-\nside a shopping mall. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial, the jury found \nthat PLO and PA employees, acting within the scope of \ntheir employment, had planned or participated in each of \nthe attacks. C.A. Doc. 81-3, at 9436, Case No. 15-3135. Ev-\nidence also showed that the PLO and PA had provided so-\ncalled \u201cmartyr\u201d payments to the families of the suicide \nterrorists in honor of their attacks and had rewarded the \nsurviving officers\u2014imprisoned for their crimes\u2014with \ngenerous salaries and promotions. C.A. Doc. 64, at 4375, \n4385, Case No. 15-3135; C.A. Doc. 67, at 5230-5231, Case \nNo. 15-3135. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million in \ndamages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA.  \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit reversed for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction. App. 1a. The circuit held that the \nPLO and PA enjoy due process rights because \u201cneither \nthe PLO nor the PA is recognized by the United States as \na sovereign state.\u201d App. 153a. It also held that the test for \npersonal jurisdiction is \u201cthe same under both the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d App. 156a. Applying \nFourteenth Amendment standards, it held that U.S. \ncourts could not exercise general jurisdiction because the \ndefendants were \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States.\u201d App. 167a.  \nPetitioners sought review in this Court, which called \nfor the views of the Solicitor General. The Solicitor Gen-\neral recommended against review, saying that \u201cfurther \ndevelopment in the lower courts is likely to be useful be-\nfore this Court addresses\u201d the issues. U.S. Br. at 17, \n\n9 \n \n \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 16-1071 (Feb. \n2018). This Court denied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nAfter Congress enacted the ATCA, the Sokolow \nplaintiffs moved to recall the Second Circuit\u2019s mandate. \nThe court denied the motion, holding that the term \n\u201cwaiver or suspension\u201d as used in the ATCA meant only \nan \u201cexpress waiver,\u201d so that the statute\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. App. 133a. Congress then en-\nacted the PSJVTA, and this Court vacated the Second \nCircuit\u2019s judgment and remanded for further considera-\ntion in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 (2020). The \nSecond Circuit in turn remanded to the district court for \nfindings and conclusions.  \n3. On remand to the district court in Sokolow, and on \na motion to dismiss in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged \nthe PSJVTA on the ground that the statute facially vio-\nlated their right to due process under the Fifth Amend-\nment. The United States intervened in both cases to de-\nfend the law\u2019s constitutionality. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092403(a).  \nIn Sokolow, plaintiffs provided extensive evidence, \nwhich the PLO and PA did not dispute, that following the \nPSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, defendants systematically paid \nsalaries to at least 175 terrorists \u201cby reason of\u201d terror at-\ntacks that resulted in the death of Americans. Dist. Ct. \nDkt. 1018, \u00b6\u00b6 2-202, No. 04 Civ. 397 (S.D.N.Y.); Dist. Ct. \nDkt. 1015-1, No. 04 Civ. 397 (S.D.N.Y.). Plaintiffs also pro-\nvided evidence that the PLO and PA had engaged in post-\ntrigger-date activities while present in the United States \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption. App. 98a. \nPlaintiffs in Fuld made similar allegations in an amended \ncomplaint, which tracked much of this evidence. App. 95a.  \nThe Sokolow and Fuld district courts accepted that \nthe PLO and PA had met the factual requirements of both \nprongs of the PSJVTA. However, they held the law fa-\ncially unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of \n\n10 \n \n \nthe Fifth Amendment. App. 87a-90a, 108a-124a. They rea-\nsoned that this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \nconsent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-Interna-\ntional Shoe precedents \u201cobsolete.\u201d App. 76a. In so ruling, \nthe Fuld district court relied on the Pennsylvania Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern \nRailway Co., 266 A.3d 542 (Pa. 2021), rev\u2019d, 600 U.S. 122 \n(2023). App. 113a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in the relevant \njurisdiction-triggering conduct by paying terrorists who \nhad murdered Americans and by conducting non-exempt \nactivities inside the United States. App. 38a. It also did \nnot dispute that the PSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due pro-\ncess requirements\u201d by providing fair warning to the de-\nfendants of the relevant conduct and by reasonably ad-\nvancing legitimate governmental interests. App. 29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause requires a consent-to-\njurisdiction statute to provide a defendant with some \u201cre-\nciprocal bargain\u201d in return. App. 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as such a \u201cbenefit.\u201d According to the court, this was \nbecause the PLO and PA\u2019s consent-manifesting conduct \nwas \u201cprohibited\u201d by prior law. App. 28a.  \nFinally, the panel rejected the requests of the United \nStates and plaintiffs to reconsider its prior decision that \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \u201cparallel one an-\nother in civil cases,\u201d on the ground that this holding was \nnow the law of the Circuit. App. 47a.  \nPlaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing en \nbanc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. App. 208a. \n\n11 \n \n \nJudge Menashi, joined in full or in part by three other \njudges, dissented. App. 229a-267a. In his view, \u201c[t]he \npanel\u2019s decision lacks a basis in the Constitution and can-\nnot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent on per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d App. 230a.  \nJudge Menashi explained that the panel\u2019s decision \nrested on three errors. First, \u201c[n]o law requires Congress \nto extend a benefit to those over whom it authorizes per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Instead, as the Supreme Court has \nmade clear, consent based on conduct need only be know-\ning and voluntary and have a nexus to the forum.\u201d Ibid. \nThose conditions were satisfied here. Ibid. \nSecond, \u201ceven if the panel were correct that the Due \nProcess Clause required a reciprocal benefit, the statute \nhere involves such a benefit because the defendants are \ndeemed to have consented based on the privilege of resid-\ning and conducting business in the United States\u2014not to \nmention furthering their political goals at the expense of \nAmerican lives.\u201d App. 231a.  \nThird, \u201cthe federal government is not similarly situ-\nated to the state governments in the extraterritorial reach \nof its courts.\u201d App. 232a. Under its original public mean-\ning, \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not limit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the \nfederal courts.\u201d App. 255a. \nJudge Bianco, who sat on the panel that invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, concurred in the denial of rehearing, reiter-\nating his view that the statute is facially unconstitutional. \nApp. 209a-228a. \n \n \n\n12 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe Second Circuit declared a federal statute facially \nunconstitutional. The ruling undermines fundamental na-\ntional security and foreign policy determinations at the \nvery core of Congress\u2019s and the President\u2019s constitutional \nauthority and expertise\u2014determinations that the political \nbranches have repeatedly and emphatically reaffirmed in \na series of statutory amendments attempting to overcome \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s misguided decisions. And the deci-\nsion below is already undermining federal authority and \ninterests in a variety of contexts.  \nThe ruling below is also incorrect. It answers a recur-\nring and important question contrary to the original pub-\nlic meaning of the Fifth Amendment; flouts this Court\u2019s \ndecisions; and improperly hamstrings congressional au-\nthority to provide for jurisdiction over extraterritorial \nconduct affecting federal interests. This Court should \ngrant review and reverse. \nI. \nTHE INVALIDATION OF A FEDERAL ANTI-TERRORISM \nSTATUTE MERITS REVIEW \n\u201c[W]hen a lower court has invalidated a federal stat-\nute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant certiorari. \nIancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). The Court ap-\nplies a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of granting writs of \ncertiorari to review decisions of lower courts holding fed-\neral statutes unconstitutional,\u201d Maricopa Cnty. v. Lopez-\nValenzuela, 574 U.S. 1006, 1007 (2014) (Thomas, J., re-\nspecting denial of stay), and it routinely does so even in \nabsence of circuit conflict. See, e.g., SEC v. Jarkesy, No. \n22-859 (2024); Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286 (2024); Con-\nsumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass\u2019n of \nAm., 601 U.S. 416 (2024); United States v. Hansen, 599 \nU.S. 762 (2023); Torres v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Public Safety, \n597 U.S. 580, 586 (2022); United States v. Vaello Madero, \n596 U.S. 159 (2022).  \n\n13 \n \n \nReview is particularly warranted in light of the sub-\nject-matter of the law struck down and the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s frustration of not one but two statutes enacted on a \nbipartisan basis (in a time of limited bipartisanship). The \nPSJVTA aims to \u201chalt, deter, and disrupt international \nterrorism,\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7-8, and to give \nAmerican terror victims and their families their day in \ncourt.  \nThe Government\u2019s interest in combatting terrorism \n\u201cis an urgent objective of the highest order.\u201d Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010); see \nGamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 687 (2019) (\u201cspecial \nprotection for U.S. nationals serves key national inter-\nests\u201d). The law also gives the PLO and PA reason to end \ntheir notorious pay-for-slay policy, under which terrorists \n(or their families) receive a reward for murdering Jews. \nThat noxious practice is \u201can incentive to commit acts of \nterror,\u201d Taylor Force Act, Pub. L. 115-141, Title X, \n\u00a7\u20091002(1) (22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378c-1 note), and it \u201cthreaten[s] \nprospects for peace, pushing the chance for a Palestinian \nstate further and further out of reach.\u201d 163 Cong. Rec. \nH9650 (Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. Engel).  \nReview is also warranted because the court of appeals \nsecond-guessed the policy judgments reflected in the \nPSJVTA, which are \u201cof a kind for which the Judiciary has \nneither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility and which \nhas long been held to belong in the domain of political \npower not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry.\u201d Chi-\ncago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman SS Corp., 333 U.S. \n103, 111 (1948). Indeed, the law merits especially \u201cre-\nspectful review by courts,\u201d because Congress enacted and \nthe President signed the PSJVTA \u201cin furtherance of their \nstance on a matter of foreign policy.\u201d Bank Markazi v. \nPeterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016). The decision below \nthus \u201cimplicates separation of powers\u201d to an even greater \n\n14 \n \n \nextent than the typical case\u2014in which there are good rea-\nsons for immediate review when \u201ca federal judge strikes \ndown an act of a coequal branch of government.\u201d Heckler \nv. Edwards, 465 U.S. 870, 881 (1984). \nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED BY INVALIDATING \nTHE PSJVTA \nThis Court has never invalidated a federal jurisdic-\ntional statute on due process grounds. Overwhelming his-\ntorical evidence (and scholarly consensus) explain why: \n\u201c[A]s originally understood, the Fifth Amendment did not \nimpose any limits on the personal jurisdiction of the fed-\neral courts. Instead, it was up to Congress to impose such \nlimits by statute.\u201d Douglass, 46 F.4th at 284 (Oldham, J., \ndissenting). No one at the Founding understood the Fifth \nAmendment as constraining Congress\u2019s authority to au-\nthorize jurisdiction over cases involving extraterritorial \nconduct at all; indeed, the federal courts routinely adjudi-\ncated such cases for more than 200 years.  \nBut even if the standards for personal jurisdiction un-\nder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments were the \nsame, the court of appeals\u2019 approach was wrong. In enact-\ning the PSJVTA, Congress specified\u2014in advance and \nwith sufficient warning\u2014the conduct that would subject \nthe PLO and PA to jurisdiction in a limited category of \ncivil cases at the heartland of federal concern. That easily \nsatisfies the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s requirement that \nexercises of personal jurisdiction must provide \u201cfair warn-\ning\u201d and must be \u201creasonable, in the context of our federal \nsystem of government.\u201d Ford Motor Co., 592 U.S. at 358 \n(citation omitted). The Second Circuit\u2019s invention of a \n\u201cgovernmental benefit\u201d requirement for consent-based \njurisdiction, and the court\u2019s perverse application of that \nnovel test, are both indefensible.  \n\n15 \n \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment Does Not Limit \nCongress\u2019s Authority To Enact Reasonable \nPersonal Jurisdiction Statutes \nThe Second Circuit held that the personal jurisdiction \nlimitations developed under the Fourteenth Amendment \nalso apply in cases in federal court governed by the Fifth \nAmendment. App. 17a, 47a. This was contrary to the orig-\ninal public meaning of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause and its application by this Court since that \ntime. As Professor Sachs explains: \u201cFor the first 150 \nyears of the Republic \u2026 the recognized doctrines of juris-\ndiction worked very differently for state and federal \ncourts.\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1706 (2020). As \noriginally understood, congressional power over personal \njurisdiction was unlimited: \u201cIf Congress wanted to exer-\ncise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a federal court \n\u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and proceed upon \nthe law.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 \n(C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (No. 11,134) (Story, J.)). The decision \nbelow, by subjecting Congress to the same limitations on \njurisdiction that apply to the States, improperly \u201ctakes \nthe Fourteenth Amendment as given, and remakes the \nFifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at 1705. \n1.  The Fifth Amendment\u2019s text, the historical back-\ndrop against which that text was drafted and ratified, and \npractice in the years following ratification all confirm that \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause was not orig-\ninally understood as restricting personal jurisdiction at \nall. Much less did it forbid adjudication if the \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d did not occur \u201cin the United States,\u201d as the Sec-\nond Circuit held. App. 8a. \na. The phrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not call to \nmind limitations on personal jurisdiction based on the lo-\ncation of the underlying conduct. So it was in 1791 as well. \n\n16 \n \n \nFounding-era dictionaries offered two potentially rele-\nvant definitions for \u201cprocess\u201d\u2014one meaning \u201call the pro-\nceedings in any cause\u201d; the other meaning \u201cthe writs and \nprecepts that go forth in an action.\u201d Max Crema & Law-\nrence B. Solum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue Process \nof Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, \n487-488 (2022). Neither sense restricts personal jurisdic-\ntion based on the location of the conduct giving rise to the \ncase. \nb.  The history preceding the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nratification firmly supports the conclusion that the Due \nProcess Clause was not understood to constrain the power \nof the federal courts in adjudicating extraterritorial con-\nduct. When the United States declared independence \nfrom England, its powers of \u201cexternal sovereignty\u201d be-\ncame \u201cvested in the federal government as necessary con-\ncomitants of nationality.\u201d United States v. Curtiss-Wright \nExp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 316-318 (1936) (citing Penhallow \nv. Doane\u2019s Administrator, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54, 80-81 \n(1795)). During the Articles of Confederation period, \ncourts in the newly independent nation adjudicated thou-\nsands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases, which arose from ex-\ntraterritorial events and implicated controversies with \nforeign parties. See Henry J. Bourguignon, The First \nFederal Court: The Federal Appellate Prize Court of the \nAmerican Revolution 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977). Many \ndelegates to the Philadelphia Convention had extensive \nexperience with such cases. Id. at 328-329; see 1 The Rec-\nords of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 124 (Max Far-\nrand ed., 1911) (Farrand). \nBuilding on the Founders\u2019 experience  with prize and \ncapture cases, the Constitution expressly contemplates \nadjudication of cases arising outside the territory of the \nUnited States, including admiralty and maritime cases \n\n17 \n \n \nand crimes \u201cnot committed within any State.\u201d U.S. Const. \nart. III, \u00a7\u20092.  \nThis extraterritorial power was a deliberate feature \nof the constitutional plan. Otherwise, as James Wilson ex-\nplained, the federal government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Debates). At the Philadelphia Convention, \nMadison observed that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establish-\nment commensurate to the legislative authority, was es-\nsential.\u201d 1 Farrand 124. Hamilton echoed this view in the \nFederalist Papers: \u201cIf there are such things as political \naxioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a govern-\nment being co-extensive with its legislative, may be \nranked among the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80 at 476 \n(Rossiter ed. 1961); accord 3 Debates 517 (Pendleton in \nVirginia); 4 Debates 156-158 (Davie in North Carolina). \nPut simply, Congress could legislate extraterritorially\u2014\nand what Congress could legislate, the federal courts \ncould adjudicate.  \nIn the Judiciary Act of 1789, the First Congress \ngranted the federal courts extraterritorial jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. Actions \ntaken by the First Congress are \u201cpresumptively con-\nsistent with the Bill of Rights.\u201d Town of Greece v. Gallo-\nway, 572 U.S. 565, 602 (2014) (Alito, J., concurring). In-\ndeed, during deliberations on the Judiciary Act, \nMadison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted and in-\ntroduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view that the \njudicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with the other \nbranches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. 843 \n(Aug. 29, 1789). \n\n18 \n \n \nc. Nothing in the known historical record of ratifica-\ntion of the Bill of Rights in 1791 indicates that anyone con-\ntemporaneously understood the Due Process Clause as \nlimiting the judicial power of the United States to the ad-\njudication of cases arising within the Nation\u2019s borders. \nSee generally Sachs, supra, at 1706; Crema & Solum, su-\npra, at 507; The Complete Bill of Rights 529-571 (Neil H. \nCogan ed., 2d ed. 2015). To the contrary, practice follow-\ning ratification of the Due Process Clause confirms that it \nimposed no such limitation. In the years following ratifi-\ncation, the Framers\u2014now implementing the Constitution \nthey had drafted, advocated for, and voted to ratify\u2014con-\nfirmed that the judicial power extended to cases involving \nconduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. \nMost prominently, in Talbot v. Jansen, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) \n133 (1795), this Court unanimously affirmed the exercise \nof jurisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of \nan incident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.2 \nTalbot marked the beginning of what would become \nlong-settled and established practice. \u201cThe prosecution \nand punishment of extraterritorial crimes, including \ncrimes committed by aliens, was one of the federal gov-\nernment\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the decades following ratifica-\ntion, and \u201cthe federal government principally used two en-\nforcement mechanisms\u2014punishment after criminal trial, \nand civil forfeiture after a condemnation by a federal \ncourt sitting in admiralty.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman, Due \n \n2 Every member of the Talbot Court had attended the Philadelphia \nConvention, his home State\u2019s ratifying convention, or both. \n\n19 \n \n \nProcess Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. Rev. 377, 409 (2017). \n\u201cAmericans appeared to believe that both enforcement \nmechanisms were consistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. \nat 410. \n2. \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s \npower to create jurisdiction over foreign conduct and de-\nfendants is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story (riding \nCircuit) explained that Congress could enact a law provid-\ning that \u201ca subject of England, or France, or Russia, hav-\ning a controversy with one of our own citizens, may be \nsummoned from the other end of the globe to obey our \nprocess, and submit to the judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F. \nCas. at 613. And though such a law might be \u201crepugnant \nto the general rights and sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \n\u201c[i]f congress had prescribed such a rule, the court would \ncertainly be bound to follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d \nId. at 613, 615. This Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning \nin Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explain-\ning that \u201cpositive legislation\u201d would be necessary to au-\nthorize federal courts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in \na foreign jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330; see The Marianna \nFlora, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 1, 18 (1825) (Story, J.) (\u201c[T]he \nact of Congress is decisive on th[e] subject\u201d of sending a \nship captured on the high seas for adjudication to the \nUnited States, \u201cand whatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws, there can be no doubt that Courts of justice are \nbound to obey and administer them\u201d). \nNo case went the other way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil \nWar did a single court, state or federal, hold a personal-\njurisdiction statute invalid on due process grounds.\u201d \nSachs, supra, at 1712; accord Chapman, supra, at 442. \nTreatises of the era confirm that the federal courts \nproperly exercised jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on \n\n20 \n \n \nAmerican Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, \nfor the purpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where \na piratical offence has been committed.\u201d) (emphasis in \noriginal).  \nAfter the Civil War, this Court held repeatedly that if \na sovereign is permitted to exclude an entity from its ter-\nritory, the sovereign has the right to permit entry on rea-\nsonable conditions, including consent to suit. See, e.g., St. \nClair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350, 356 (1882). The Court also ap-\nplied that principle to the Fifth Amendment. In Baltimore \n& Ohio Railroad Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65 \n(1870), this Court upheld the assertion of personal juris-\ndiction by courts of the District of Columbia over a Mary-\nland corporation that injured a passenger in Virginia. It \nreasoned that Congress was within its rights to determine \nthat a corporation \u201cmay exercise its authority in a foreign \nterritory [i.e., in D.C.] upon such conditions as may be \nprescribed by the law of the place. One of these conditions \nmay be that it shall consent to be sued there.\u201d Id. at 81. \nIn sum, an in personam suit \u201ccould be maintained by \nanyone on any claim in any place the defendant could be \nfound.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plurality).  \n3. Personal jurisdiction rules under the Fourteenth \nAmendment changed in the Lochner era, when this Court \nbegan invoking due process to restrict state authority to \nadjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in other \nStates. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U.S. \n394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills v. \nMenefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); Simon v. S. R. Co., \n236 U.S. 115, 130 (1915). But even then, the Court repeat-\nedly reaffirmed that territorial limitations imposed on the \nStates by the Fourteenth Amendment afford \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n21 \n \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933); Cook v. Tait, 265 \nU.S. 47, 55-56 (1924); Panama R. Co. v. Napier Shipping \nCo., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897) (\u201cThe fact that the cause of \naction arose in the waters of a foreign port is immate-\nrial.\u201d). \nThis Court has continued to restrict state power to \nexercise personal jurisdiction by imposing \u201cterritorial \nlimitations\u201d under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, which \u201cact[s] as an instrument of in-\nterstate federalism.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Supe-\nrior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 263 (2017). Yet it has \nexpressed the opposite view about the territorial compe-\ntence of the National Government: \u201cIf Congress has pro-\nvided an unmistakable instruction that the provision is ex-\ntraterritorial, then claims alleging exclusively foreign \nconduct may proceed.\u201d Abitron Austria GmbH v. \nHetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 (2023). This is true \n\u201cregardless of whether the particular statute regulates \nconduct, affords relief, or merely confers jurisdiction.\u201d \nRJR Nabisco, Inc. v. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nAnd this Court has been careful, when considering con-\nstraints imposed on the jurisdiction of a State under the \nFourteenth Amendment, to make clear that it was not \nsuggesting that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment imposes the same \nrestrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a \nfederal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 582 U.S. at 269.  \n4. As a result of the rulings below, courts in the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2014and others that have followed suit\u2014now \nroutinely dismiss civil cases brought under other federal \nstatutes involving extraterritorial conduct, notwith-\n\n22 \n \n \nstanding statutory authorization for such suits.3 As Judge \nElrod observed, the law of these Circuits \u201ceffectively neu-\nters Congress of its ability to use our own legal system \nand its well-established rule of law to help right the most \ngrievous wrongs committed against Americans abroad.\u201d \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 278 (dissenting).  \nIn Douglass, for instance, the Fifth Circuit, citing the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s decision here, applied the Fourteenth \nAmendment\u2019s test for personal jurisdiction to suits under \nthe Death on the High Seas Act, which authorizes the per-\nsonal representative of a person who died on the high seas \nto \u201cbring a civil action in admiralty against the person or \nvessel responsible.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u200930302. As a result, claims \nunder that statute are now effectively limited to those \nagainst domestic entities. See Douglass, 46 F.4th at 276-\n277 (Elrod, J., dissenting). Under similar reasoning, the \nEleventh Circuit recently gutted the Helms-Burton Act, \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20096081 et seq., which imposes liability on persons \nwho traffic in U.S. property expropriated by the Castro \nregime. Herederos de Roberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. \nTeck Resources Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th Cir. 2022). \nAn even more striking illustration of the harmful con-\nsequences of conflating the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments\u2019 tests comes from the Second Circuit itself. In a re-\ncent case, the court affirmed the dismissal of a False \nClaims Act complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction be-\ncause the \u201cfraudulent [documents] were signed by [the \nfraudster\u2019s] executives in cities outside of the United \nStates.\u201d United States ex. rel. TZAC, Inc. v. Christian \n \n3 See, e.g., Prime Int\u2019l Trading, Ltd. v. BP P.L.C., 784 Fed.\u2009App\u2019x 4, \n9 (2d Cir. 2019); In re SSA Bonds Antitrust Litig., 420 F.\u2009Supp. 3d \n219, 240\u2013241 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Dennis v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 343 \nF.\u2009Supp.\u20093d 122, 199\u2013207 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Sonterra Cap. Master \nFund Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Grp. AG, 277 F.\u2009Supp.\u20093d 521, 596 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2017). \n\n23 \n \n \nAid, No. 17-cv-4135 (PKC), 2021 WL 2354985, at *4 \n(S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2021), aff\u2019d mem. No. 21-1542, 2022 WL \n2165751 (2d Cir. June 16, 2022). Thus, in the Second Cir-\ncuit, even a fraud perpetrated against the United States \nis beyond the judicial power of the United States if the \nfraudster acted abroad. \nUnsurprisingly, the Second Circuit\u2019s position has \nbeen subject to widespread scholarly and judicial criti-\ncism. See, e.g., Sachs, supra, at 1706 (Second Circuit\u2019s ap-\nproach is \u201call backwards\u201d); Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n597-598 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (Rao, J., concurring) (\u201clittle (or \nno) evidence\u201d supporting it); Douglass, 46 F.4th at 263 \n(Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cThis is anachronism.\u201d); id. at 284 \n(Oldham, J., dissenting). \n5. Reverse-incorporating the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s federalism-based limitations into the fundamen-\ntally different Fifth Amendment context also creates in-\ntolerable doctrinal incongruities. As Judge Elrod put it, \ncircuit \u201cprecedents are awash with confusion.\u201d Id., 46 \nF.4th at 282 (Elrod, J., dissenting). \nFirst, the PLO and PA are foreign political entities \naspiring to international statehood; as such, their amena-\nbility to suit in federal court should lie solely in the hands \nof the political branches, not the Judiciary. As the Office \nof Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the PLO purports to \nbe an independent sovereign entity, we have little diffi-\nculty concluding that it falls into [the] category\u201d of entities \nthat \u201cexist outside the constitutional compact and have no \nrights or responsibilities under it.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. 105 \n(1987). The Second Circuit got this backwards, holding \nthat the PLO and PA have due process rights because \nthey are not \u201crecognized by the United States as a sover-\neign state.\u201d App. 94a, 153a. According to the Second Cir-\ncuit, allowing the political branches to subject the PLO \nand PA to suit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d \n\n24 \n \n \nApp. 30a n.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was \nwrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nApp. 238a (citation omitted). Relatedly, because of their \nstatus, the United States has the absolute right to exclude \nthe PLO and PA from its territory. See Palestinian Info. \nOff. v. Shultz, 853 F.2d 932, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Under \nlong-standing case law, the sovereign\u2019s right to exclude \nthese entities includes the less-draconian right to permit \nentry on reasonable conditions, including consent to suit. \nSt. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356; Harris, 79 U.S. at 81. \nSecond, as Judge Elrod has observed, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s rule means that \u201ccivil foreign defendants now \nhave more due process rights than criminal foreign de-\nfendants.\u201d 46 F.4th at 276; accord App. 250a (Menashi, J., \ndissenting). In criminal cases arising from extraterritorial \nconduct, the courts of appeals unanimously exercise juris-\ndiction whenever a defendant caused harm to \u201cU.S. citi-\nzens or interests.\u201d United States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d \n154, 167-168 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). The \nPSJVTA would easily satisfy that test, since it is focused \non acts of terrorism harming a \u201cnational of the United \nStates.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). But the Second Circuit has \nnow imposed a far more stringent requirement for civil \ncases, asserting that the \u201cthe due process test for assert-\ning jurisdiction over extra-territorial criminal conduct \u2026 \ndiffers from the test applicable in [a] civil case.\u201d App. 175a. \n\n25 \n \n \nThat makes no sense. Outside the context of personal \njurisdiction, this Court has sometimes required a stricter \ndue process standard in criminal cases than in civil cases. \nSee, e.g., Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Ad-\ndington v. Texas, 331 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has \nnever suggested that the reverse should be true\u2014that a \nstricter standard might apply in civil cases than in crimi-\nnal cases. How could it be constitutional for the govern-\nment to obtain a sentence of death against a foreign na-\ntional for acts of terrorism committed abroad, but \nunconstitutional for it to seek a civil fine or forfeiture of \nthe same defendant\u2019s property based on the same conduct \nin the same place? Or as Judge Elrod aptly summarized: \n\u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold that allowing a civil lawsuit \nagainst a foreign defendant for foreign conduct violates \ndue process but that a criminal prosecution against the \nsame defendant for the same foreign conduct does not.\u201d \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 270 (dissenting). \nB. The PSJVTA Satisfies Due Process Even Under \nThe Fourteenth Amendment Standard \nEven if the Court were apply the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s due process standard to jurisdictional statutes en-\nacted by Congress, the Second Circuit\u2019s decision to invent \na new due process test and its application of that new test \nwere both indefensible.  \nThe Traditional Due Process Test  \n1. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, exercises of \njurisdiction must provide the defendant with \u201cfair warn-\ning\u201d and must be \u201creasonable, in the context of our federal \nsystem of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. at 358 (ci-\ntations omitted). This parallels the Court\u2019s general under-\nstanding that due process safeguards \u201cfundamental fair-\nness (through notice and fair warning) and the prevention \nof the arbitrary and vindictive use of the laws.\u201d Rogers v. \n\n26 \n \n \nTennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 460 (2001); see Village of Euclid \nv. Amber Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926); Hurtado v. \nCalifornia, 110 U.S. 516, 527 (1884). \nThe PSJVTA easily meets that test. It provides \u201cfair \nwarning,\u201d by specifying the conduct deemed to constitute \nconsent to jurisdiction, and by giving the PLO and PA an \nadvance-warning period. See id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). The stat-\nute also reasonably advances legitimate\u2014indeed, vital\u2014\nfederal interests. Congress enacted the PSJVTA to deter \nand disrupt terrorism; compensate American terror vic-\ntims; and end the PLO and PA\u2019s noxious pay-for-slay pol-\nicy, thereby advancing the prospects for peace in the Mid-\ndle East. See p. 13, supra.  \nThe PSJVTA is thus reasonable within our federal \nsystem. Importantly, \u201cpersonal jurisdiction requires a fo-\nrum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d J. \nMcIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) \n(plurality). In the context of state-court jurisdiction, the \n\u201cfederalism interest may be decisive,\u201d because \u201c[t]he sov-\nereignty of each State implies a limitation on the sover-\neignty of all its sister States.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 \nU.S. at 263. In that context, federalism principles \u201censure \nthat States with little legitimate interest in a suit do not \nencroach on States more affected by the controversy.\u201d \nFord Motor, 592 U.S. at 360 (quotation marks omitted). \nThis case is different. It implicates national interests \nof the United States. The law creates jurisdiction in a lim-\nited category of antiterrorism cases under a federal stat-\nute (the ATA) that involve American citizens and that ad-\nvance federal interests. Such assertions of jurisdiction do \nnot infringe the sovereignty of any other entity within our \nconstitutional framework. Determinations about whether \nand when to subject foreign entities such as these defend-\nants to jurisdiction is a question well within the compe-\ntency and authority of the political branches. See 11 Op. \n\n27 \n \n \nO.L.C. at 108 (\u201cthe political branches may deny foreign \n[political] entities as such all constitutional rights\u201d). \n2.  Rather than apply established due-process stand-\nards, the Second Circuit invented a new due-process test \nfor consent-based jurisdictional statutes. According to the \ncourt, Congress (or a State) cannot enact a consent-based \njurisdictional statute unless the consent is \u201cin exchange \nfor, or as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit \nor privilege.\u201d App. 24a. In the court\u2019s view, this additional \nrequirement ensures that the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d is a suf-\nficiently close \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Ibid. This rea-\nsoning cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s precedents. \nAs this Court explained just last Term, a defendant \nvalidly consents under a jurisdiction-triggering statute if \nthe defendant \u201cappreciated the jurisdictional conse-\nquences attending [its] actions and proceeded anyway.\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality). Deemed-consent stat-\nutes permissibly \u201cadapt the traditional rule about transi-\ntory actions for individuals to artificial persons created by \nlaw\u201d by ensuring that corporate defendants are deemed \nto be \u201cfound\u201d in the State. Id. at 129-130. \nIn Mallory, as here, the defendant argued that it had \n\u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction by engaging in a \n\u201cmeaningless formalit[y]\u201d\u2014in that case, designating an \nagent for service of process despite \u201cappreciat[ing] the ju-\nrisdictional consequences\u201d of doing so. Id. at 144. This \nCourt rejected the defendant\u2019s argument: \u201ca legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Ins. Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704-\n\n28 \n \n \n705 (1982)). Justice Alito, whose concurrence formed the \nmajority, agreed: There was no due process violation be-\ncause the defendant \u201cacted with knowledge of state law \nwhen it registered,\u201d such that the Court may \u201cpresume \nthat by registering, it consented to all valid conditions im-\nposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 (cleaned up). That reason-\ning controls here.  \n3. The Second Circuit rejected the relevance of Mal-\nlory on the ground that the statute there gave the defend-\nant \u201ca benefit from the forum in exchange for its amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts.\u201d App. 20a. Judge \nMenashi explained why that is incorrect: \n[A] separate statute treats \u201c \u2018qualification as a foreign \ncorporation\u2019 to be a \u2018sufficient basis\u2019 for Pennsylvania \ncourts \u2018to exercise general personal jurisdiction\u2019 over \nan out-of-state company.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 151 \n(Alito, J.) (quoting 42 Pa. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i) (2019)). \nNeither statute indicated that personal jurisdiction \nwas being exchanged for the benefit of operating in \nPennsylvania; the statutes did not even reference \neach other. \nApp. 244a. \nThe ruling below also reflects a basic logic error. \nWhile \u201caccepting an in-state benefit with jurisdictional \nstrings attached\u201d is one way to consent to personal juris-\ndiction, Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality), this Court has \nnever suggested it is the only way. To the contrary, even \na \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone step\u201d across an \u201cinvisible \nstate line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdictional consequences [that] \nare immediate and serious.\u201d Ibid. Or as Justice Jackson \nexplained, a defendant may consent to jurisdiction \u201cmore \nthan one way,\u201d including: (1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly con-\nsenting,\u201d by engaging in conduct deemed consent under \nlaw; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to follow specific procedural rules\u201d; \nor (3) by \u201cvoluntarily invoking certain benefits from a \n\n29 \n \n \nState that are conditioned on submitting to the State\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. The Second Circuit simply \nerased the first category. That was incorrect. As Justice \nJackson explained: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction rights expressly or construc-\ntively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. of Ire-\nland is the same: When a defendant chooses to en-\ngage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148. \nApplication Of The Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cReciprocity\u201d Test  \n1. As Judge Menashi pointed out, even if a reciprocal \n\u201cbenefit\u201d were required, the PLO and PA received one, \n\u201cbecause the defendants are deemed to have consented \nbased on the privilege of residing and conducting business \nin the United States\u2014not to mention furthering their po-\nlitical goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d App. 231a. \nThe Second Circuit observed that PLO and PA \u201cdo not \ndispute they have engaged in these types of activities.\u201d \nApp. 73a.  \nIt is uncontested that after the statutory trigger date, \ndefendants continued their pay-for-slay programs, and \nthat their U.S.-based officers, employees, and agents con-\nducted extensive domestic activities, such as: notarizing \ndocuments in the United States, as a part of a certification \nprocess for use by defendants\u2019 agencies; meeting with \nU.S.-based groups to encourage them to \u201clobby[] the gov-\nernment, lobby[] Congress\u201d to support \u201cjustice for the \nPalestinian people\u201d; and using U.S.-based social media \nplatforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d and \u201cbring atten-\ntion\u201d to their cause. Sokolow D.Ct. Dkt. 1057 at 6-11. The \n\n30 \n \n \nPLO and PA\u2019s ability to engage in these activities while \nphysically present in the United States was a meaningful \nbenefit. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 637 \n(1990) (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant received \u201csig-\nnificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for three days). \n2. The Second Circuit dismissed defendants\u2019 U.S.-\nbased conduct as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfed-\neral law has long prohibited the PLO and PA from engag-\ning in any activities or maintaining any offices in the \nUnited States.\u201d App. 28a. As a result, the court said, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d App. 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was simply incorrect that \nthe PLO and PA\u2019s jurisdiction-triggering conduct was \nprohibited by federal law. The relevant statute forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; see Application of the Anti-Ter-\nrorism Act of 1987 to Diplomatic Visit of Palestinian Del-\negation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __ (slip op. Oct 28, 2022). Their non-\nexpenditure activities\u2014including notarizing documents, \nholding meetings, and issuing public statements\u2014are not \nillegal. See App. 251a (Menashi, J., dissenting) (\u201cAt least \nwith respect to the PA, most such activities do not appear \nto be prohibited.\u201d). \nBut even if all their U.S.-based conduct were prohib-\nited, that would only make the PSJVTA more reasonable, \nnot less. As Judge Menashi explained, \u201c[t]he fact that the \nPLO and the PA extracted a benefit from the United \nStates in violation of the law\u2014and additionally benefited \nfrom the federal government\u2019s nonenforcement of the \nlaw\u2014does not alter the fact that those organizations re-\nceived the benefit from the forum that the statute envi-\nsions.\u201d App. 250a. Indeed, \u201ca foreign actor that conducts \nunauthorized business in the United States has obtained \n\n31 \n \n \nan even greater benefit from the forum than the foreign \nactor that complies with American law,\u201d App. 250a, and it \nwould be \u201cperverse\u201d to give the law-breaker protection \nthat a law-abiding foreigner does not get, App. 231a. \nTo drive the point home, consider an analogous con-\nsent statute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent \nlaws that require motorists, as a condition of operating a \nmotor vehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol \ncontent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained \non suspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201cbenefits\u201d test, these implied-consent statues would \nbe constitutional only as applied to validly licensed drivers \nwho exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege of driving on \nstate roads.\u201d App. 37a n.14 (citation omitted). They would \nbe unconstitutional as applied to motorists whose li-\ncenses have been suspended or revoked, because such \npersons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driving under ex-\nisting law. No principle of due process imposes such irra-\ntional limits on the political branches.  \nIII. THESE CASES PRESENT AN IDEAL VEHICLE FOR \nRESOLVING THE ISSUES PRESENTED \nThese cases (consolidated by the court of appeals) are \nan ideal vehicle, both for considering the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutionality and for resolving long-reserved questions \nabout Congress\u2019s authority under the Fifth Amendment. \nThey present the legal issues squarely and cleanly. The \nPSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality\u2014including the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment constrains Congress\u2019s au-\nthority to create personal jurisdiction in the same manner \nthat the Fourteenth Amendment constrains the States\u2014\nwas raised and thoroughly briefed by all parties, including \nthe Government, which intervened in both cases. As for \nthe facts, the PLO and PA did not contest below the gran-\nular and expansive factual showing that they engaged in \n\n32 \n \n \nspecified conduct such as paying the families of convicted \nor \u201cmartyred\u201d terrorists and conducting U.S.-based activ-\nities. The district courts and the Second Circuit all as-\nsumed for purposes of their rulings that both of the stat-\nute\u2019s prongs were satisfied. App. 38a, 87a-90a, 108a-124a. \nThe legal issues were also outcome-determinative in \nboth cases. In Sokolow, petitioners prevailed on the mer-\nits of their ATA claims after a seven-week trial, and the \njury\u2019s verdict and corresponding judgment were thrown \nout solely on the basis of personal jurisdiction. In Fuld, \nthe district court dismissed the complaint for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.  \nFinally, there is no reason to postpone review of the \nquestion whether due process constrains Congress under \nthe Fifth Amendment the same way that it constrains the \nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment. The percola-\ntion recommended by the Government in 2018 has led to \nextensive opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the Sec-\nond, Fifth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits.

PLLC, New \nYork, NY, for Amici Curiae Constitutional Law \nScholars Philip C. Bobbitt, Michael C.

The \ndistrict court dismissed those claims for lack of personal \njurisdiction over the defendants. The Government, as in-\ntervenor in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Fed-\neral Rule of Civil Procedure 5.1(c), also appeals from the \njudgment. \nAt issue in this appeal is the constitutionality of the \nPromoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 \nStat. 2534, 3082, the federal statute on which the plaintiffs \nrelied to allege personal jurisdiction over the defendants. \nThe PSJVTA was enacted for the precise purpose of pre-\nventing dismissals based on lack of personal jurisdiction in \ncases just like this one \u2014 civil actions against the PLO and \nthe PA pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333, which provides a damages remedy for \n\n5a \n \nUnited States nationals injured \u201cby reason of an act of in-\nternational terrorism,\u201d id. \u00a7 2333(a). \nCongress crafted the PSJVTA in response to a series \nof judicial decisions, all arising out of civil ATA cases re-\nlated to terrorist activity abroad, which held that federal \ncourts had no general or specific personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA. The resulting statute reflects a leg-\nislative effort to create personal jurisdiction over those en-\ntities based on alleged consent, which, when validly given, \nmay constitute an independent constitutional basis for \nsubjecting a nonresident defendant to litigation in a par-\nticular forum. The PSJVTA specifically provides that the \nPLO and the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction in [any] civil [ATA] action,\u201d irrespec-\ntive of \u201cthe date of the occurrence of the act of interna-\ntional terrorism\u201d at issue, upon engaging in certain forms \nof post-enactment conduct, namely (1) making payments, \ndirectly or indirectly, to the designees or families of incar-\ncerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, whose acts of \nterror injured or killed a United States national, or (2) un-\ndertaking any activities within the United States, subject \nto a handful of exceptions. Id. \u00a7 2334(e). \nThe district court determined that this \u201cdeemed con-\nsent\u201d provision was an unconstitutional attempt to create \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants where none ex-\nisted, and it accordingly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 civil ATA \naction for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(2). Both the plaintiffs \nand the Government (together, \u201cappellants\u201d) challenge \nthat conclusion on appeal, arguing principally that the ex-\nercise of this \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction under the \nPSJVTA satisfies the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause. \n\n6a \n \nWe conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is inconsistent \nwith the requirements of constitutional due process. Ac-\ncordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dis-\nmissing this case. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nThe plaintiffs are the widowed spouse and children of \nAri Yoel Fuld, a United States citizen who was fatally \nstabbed during a September 2018 terrorist attack outside \na shopping mall in the West Bank. In the aftermath of \nFuld\u2019s death, the plaintiffs commenced this action against \nthe PLO and the PA, alleging that these defendants had \n\u201cencouraged, incentivized, and assisted\u201d the nonparty who \ncommitted the attack on Fuld. Am. Compl. \u00b6 4. The PA, \nestablished in 1993 pursuant to the Oslo Accords, is the \nnon-sovereign and interim governing body of parts of the \nGaza Strip and the West Bank (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d). The PLO, an entity founded in 1964, \nconducts Palestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Per-\nmanent Observer to the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) on behalf \nof the Palestinian people. The plaintiffs seek monetary re-\nlief from both defendants pursuant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333, which, as relevant here, provides United States na-\ntionals \u201cinjured . . . by reason of an act of international ter-\nrorism\u201d with a civil damages remedy against \u201cany person \nwho aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial as-\nsistance [to],\u201d the perpetrator of the attack. Id. \u00a7 2333(a), \n(d)(2). \nSeveral years before these plaintiffs initiated their \ncase, and prior to the passage of the PSJVTA, this Court \ndecided Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Organization, \n835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert denied sub \nnom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization, 138 \nS. Ct. 1438 (2018) (mem.), which arose out of litigation \n\n7a \n \ninvolving civil ATA claims similar in key respects to those \nasserted here.1 The Waldman plaintiffs, a group of United \nStates citizens injured or killed during terror attacks in \nIsrael and the estates or survivors of such citizens, sued \nthe PLO and the PA for money damages pursuant to the \nATA, alleging that the defendants had provided material \nsupport to the nonparties who carried out the attacks. Af-\nter more than a decade of litigation and a substantial jury \nverdict in favor of the plaintiffs, the defendants filed their \nappeal in this Court, where they reasserted their \nlongstanding objection that the claims against them \nshould be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. \nThis Court ultimately agreed with the defendants, \nconcluding that dismissal was required because, notwith-\nstanding the \u201cunquestionably horrific\u201d nature of the at-\ntacks underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, \u201c[t]he district court \ncould not constitutionally exercise either general or spe-\ncific personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d Waldman \nI, 835 F.3d at 344. We explained, as a threshold matter, \nthat while sovereign governments lack due process rights, \n\u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is recognized by the United \nStates as a sovereign state,\u201d and accordingly, both defend-\nants are entitled to due process protections. Id. at 329. \nMoreover, we noted that our precedents established that \nthe \u201cdue process analysis\u201d in the personal jurisdiction con-\ntext \u201cis basically the same under both the Fifth and Four-\nteenth Amendments,\u201d except that \u201cunder the Fifth \nAmendment the court can consider the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts throughout the United States, while under the \n \n1 The procedural history of the Waldman litigation (captioned \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 04-cv-397 \n(S.D.N.Y.) in the district court) is set forth in greater detail in Wald-\nman v. Palestine Liberation Organization,    F.4th   , No. 15- 3135 (2d \nCir. Sept. 8, 2023) (\u201cWaldman III\u201d) (per curiam), which we also decide \ntoday. \n\n8a \n \nFourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the forum \nstate may be considered.\u201d Id. at 330 (quoting Chew v. Die-\ntrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998)). \nWith these background principles in mind, we con-\ncluded that the district court lacked general personal ju-\nrisdiction over the defendants \u201cpursuant to the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s recent decision\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 \nU.S. 117 (2014), because neither defendant\u2019s contacts with \nthe forum were \u201cso constant and pervasive as to render [it] \nessentially at home\u201d in the United States. Waldman I, 835 \nF.3d at 331, 335 (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. at 122). We \nrejected the notion that the defendants could be consid-\nered \u201cessentially at home\u201d in this country based on their \nactivities in Washington, D.C., which were \u201climited to \nmaintaining an office [there], promoting the Palestinian \ncause in speeches and media appearances, and retaining a \nlobbying firm.\u201d Id. at 333. Rather, both the PLO and the \nPA \u201care \u2018at home\u2019 in Palestine, where these entities are \nheadquartered and from where they are directed.\u201d Id. at \n334 (citing Daimler, 571 U.S. at 139 n.20). \nThis Court likewise held that the district court could \nnot properly exercise specific personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA, in view of the absence of any \u201csub-\nstantial connection\u201d between \u201cthe defendants\u2019 suit-related \nconduct \u2014 their role in the six terror attacks at issue \u2014 \n[and] . . . the forum.\u201d Id. at 335 (citing Walden v. Fiore, 571 \nU.S. 277, 284 (2014)). We explained that the terrorist at-\ntacks themselves took place outside the United States, \nthat \u201cthe defendants\u2019 [related] activities in violation of the \nATA occurred outside the United States,\u201d and that none \nof these acts were \u201cspecifically targeted\u201d or \u201cexpressly \naimed\u201d at the United States. Id. at 335, 337\u201338. Indeed, \nthe attacks in question were \u201crandom,\u201d such that they \u201caf-\nfected United States citizens only because [those citizens] \n\n9a \n \nwere victims of indiscriminate violence . . . abroad.\u201d Id. at \n337. Thus, the actions for which the defendants had been \nsued \u201cwere not sufficiently connected to the United States \nto provide specific personal jurisdiction,\u201d and the \u201climits \nprescribed by [constitutional] due process\u201d required that \nthe case be dismissed. Id. at 337, 344. In a series of com-\nparable cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit reached the same conclusions. \nSee Livnat v.

This new subsection \nprovided that \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of \nthe act of international terrorism upon which [a] civil ac-\ntion [pursuant to the ATA] was filed,\u201d a defendant would \n\u201cbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nsuch civil action if,\u201d after more than 120 days following the \nATCA\u2019s enactment, the defendant (1) \u201caccept[ed]\u201d certain \n\u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from the United States, or (2) \n\u201cmaintain[ed]\u201d an office \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the \n\n10a \n \nUnited States\u201d while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspen-\nsion\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, a statutory provision expressly \nbarring the PLO from operating any such office.

At that point, no waivers or \nsuspensions of this provision remained in effect. See Klieman, 923 \nF.3d at 1130.

See Klieman, 923 \nF.3d at 1128 (dismissing ATA claims against the PLO and \nthe PA for lack of personal jurisdiction and explaining, in \nrelevant part, that the ATCA\u2019s \u201cfactual predicates\u201d had \nnot been \u201ctriggered\u201d). \nWhile petitions for writs of certiorari from Waldman \nII and Klieman were pending, Congress stepped in again, \nthis time enacting the PSJVTA on December 20, 2019. See \nPub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082 (2019). \nSection 903(c) of the PSJVTA superseded the relevant \nportions of the ATCA, resulting in various amendments to \nthe personal jurisdiction provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).3 \n133 Stat. at 3083\u201385. Those amendments included a nar-\nrowed definition of the term \u201cdefendant,\u201d which now re-\nfers exclusively to the PLO, the PA, and any \u201csucces-\nsor[s]\u201d or \u201caffiliate[s]\u201d thereof. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). In \ndrafting the PSJVTA, Congress also specified new post-\nenactment conduct that would be \u201cdeemed\u201d to constitute \n\u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction in \u201cany civil action\u201d un-\nder the ATA, \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of \nthe act of international terrorism upon which such civil ac-\ntion was filed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nAs amended pursuant to the PSJVTA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1) includes two subparagraphs that list the \n \n3 The PSJVTA also includes a number of additional provisions, but \nonly the jurisdictional amendments of \u00a7 903(c) are at issue in this case. \nWe do not pass on the constitutionality of any portion of the PSJVTA \nother than \u00a7 903(c). However, for purposes of clarity, this opinion re-\nfers to \u00a7 903(c) as the PSJVTA, which is consistent with the nomen-\nclature used in the district court\u2019s decision and the parties\u2019 briefs on \nappeal. \n\n12a \n \ncircumstances under which \u201ca defendant shall be deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in a civil ATA \ncase. Subparagraph (A) provides, first, that a defendant \n\u201cshall be deemed to have consented\u201d to such jurisdiction \nif, \u201cafter . . . 120 days\u201d following the enactment of the \nPSJVTA (that is, after April 18, 2020), the defendant \n\u201cmakes any payment, directly or indirectly\u201d: \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, af-\nter being fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been \nimprisoned for committing any act of terrorism \nthat injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of such \nimprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, following \nsuch individual's death while committing an act of \nterrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason \nof the death of such individual. \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). This subparagraph refers, in the words \nof other federal legislation on the subject, to a \u201cpractice of \npaying salaries to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons[] \n[and] to the families of deceased terrorists,\u201d Taylor Force \nAct, Pub. L. No. 115-141, \u00a7 1002, 132 Stat. 348, 1143 (2018), \nwhich Congress has previously condemned as \u201can incen-\ntive to commit acts of terror.\u201d Id. \nSubparagraph (B) of the PSJVTA provides that \u201ca de-\nfendant shall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d in a civil ATA action if, \u201cafter 15 days\u201d following \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s enactment (that is, after January 4, 2020), \nthe defendant \u201ccontinues to maintain,\u201d \u201cestablishes,\u201d or \n\u201cprocures any office, headquarters, premises, or other fa-\ncilities or establishments in the United States,\u201d or other-\nwise \u201cconducts any activity while physically present in the \nUnited States on behalf of the [PLO] or the [PA].\u201d 18 \n\n13a \n \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The PSJVTA exempts \u201ccertain ac-\ntivities and locations\u201d from the reach of subparagraph (B), \nincluding facilities and activities devoted \u201cexclusively [to] \nthe purpose of conducting official business of the United \nNations,\u201d id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(A)\u2013(B), specified activities re-\nlated to engagements with United States officials or legal \nrepresentation, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(C)\u2013(E), and any \u201cpersonal \nor official activities conducted ancillary to activities listed\u201d \nin these exceptions, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(F). \nThe PSJVTA includes a \u201crule[] of construction,\u201d \nwhich provides that the legislation\u2019s terms \u201cshould be lib-\nerally construed to carry out the purposes of Congress to \nprovide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d PSJVTA \n\u00a7 903(d)(1)(A), 133 Stat. at 3085. Congress also specified \nthat the PSJVTA \u201cshall apply to any case pending on or \nafter August 30, 2016,\u201d id. \u00a7 903(d)(2), 133 Stat. at 3085, \nreferring to the date just one day before this Court\u2019s deci-\nsion in Waldman I. \nOn April 27, 2020, several months after the PSJVTA\u2019s \nenactment, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in \nWaldman II and Klieman, vacated both judgments, and \nremanded the cases \u201cfor further consideration in light of \nthe [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714; see Klieman, \n140 S. Ct. at 2713. Three days later, on April 30, 2020, the \nplaintiffs commenced this action. The plaintiffs invoked \nthe PSJVTA as the sole basis for personal jurisdiction, and \ntheir amended complaint alleged that both prongs of the \nstatute\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision had been satisfied. \nWith respect to the first prong, the plaintiffs alleged that, \nafter April 18, 2020, the defendants continued an existing \npractice of making payments to (1) the designees of incar-\ncerated terrorists who were fairly convicted of attacks that \nkilled or injured United States nationals, and (2) the fam-\nilies of deceased terrorists who died while committing \n\n14a \n \nattacks that killed or injured United States nationals. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). For the second prong, the plain-\ntiffs alleged that, after January 4, 2020, the defendants (1) \nused an office maintained in the United States, namely \ntheir UN Permanent Observer Mission in New York City, \nfor purposes other than official UN business, and (2) en-\ngaged in various activities on their own behalf while in the \nUnited States, including providing consular services, hold-\ning press conferences, and publishing various online and \nprint materials designed to influence American foreign \npolicy. See id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and the PA moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 \namended complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfor failure to state a claim, pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), respectively. In con-\nnection with their Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the defendants \nchallenged the constitutionality of the PSJVTA, arguing \nthat the statute\u2019s provision for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to per-\nsonal jurisdiction violated due process requirements. The \ndistrict court certified this constitutional challenge to the \nUnited States Attorney General, and the Government in-\ntervened in the action to defend the PSJVTA. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a); Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1. \nIn a January 6, 2022 decision, the district court \ngranted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss on \nthe ground that it could not validly exercise personal ju-\nrisdiction under the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., 578 F. Supp. \n3d 577, 580, 596 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). The court noted at the \noutset that \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent, \nwhether express or implied,\u201d can serve as an \u201cindepend-\nent\u201d basis for personal jurisdiction, separate and apart \nfrom \u201cgeneral jurisdiction[] . . . [and] specific jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 579. Moreover, the court observed that the PLO and \n\n15a \n \nthe PA did \u201cnot dispute\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they \nhad made payments triggering the PSJVTA\u2019s first \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d prong.4 Id. at 583. Nevertheless, the \ndistrict court concluded that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the \nPSJVTA could not \u201cconstitutionally provide for personal \njurisdiction over [the] [d]efendants.\u201d Id. at 587. The court \nreasoned that the predicate activities under the PSJVTA \ndo not \u201ceven remotely signal[] approval or acceptance of,\u201d \nor an \u201cinten[t] to submit to,\u201d jurisdiction in the United \nStates, id. (internal quotation marks omitted), that the \nstatute \u201cpush[es] the concept of consent well beyond its \nbreaking point,\u201d id. at 595, and that \u201clegislature[s] [can-\nnot] simply create [personal] jurisdiction out of whole \ncloth by deeming any conduct [whatsoever] to be \u2018con-\nsent,\u2019\u201d id. at 580. In short, the district court concluded that \n\u201cdeemed consent jurisdiction\u201d under the PSJVTA is not \n\u201cconsistent with the requirements of due process,\u201d and ac-\ncordingly, the action had to be dismissed for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe district court entered final judgment on January \n7, 2022. Both the plaintiffs and the Government timely ap-\npealed. \n \n4 The defendants did, however, \u201ccontest [the] [p]laintiffs\u2019 allegations \nthat the PSJVTA\u2019s second \u2018deemed consent\u2019 prong ha[d] been met.\u201d \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583 n.3. The defendants argued that to the \nextent they had conducted activities within the United States after the \nrelevant post-enactment date, all of those activities fell within the ex-\nceptions for UN-related undertakings and \u201cancillary\u201d conduct. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). In light of its finding that \u201cthe PSJVTA\u2019s first \nprong ha[d] been met,\u201d the district court declined to consider \n\u201cwhether [the] [d]efendants\u2019 conduct also implicate[d] the second \nprong.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583 n.3. It is also unnecessary to ad-\ndress that question on this appeal. \n\n16a \n \nII. DISCUSSION \nWe review the dismissal of a complaint for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction de novo, construing the pleadings in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs and resolving all \ndoubts in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. V&A Collection, LLC v. \nGuzzini Props. Ltd., 46 F.4th 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2022). Like-\nwise, we review de novo questions of law, including chal-\nlenges to the constitutionality of a statute. United States \nv. Wasylyshyn, 979 F.3d 165, 172 (2d Cir. 2020). \n\u201cBefore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover a defendant, three requirements must be met: (1) \u2018the \nplaintiff\u2019s service of process upon the defendant must have \nbeen procedurally proper\u2019; (2) \u2018there must be a statutory \nbasis for personal jurisdiction that renders such service of \nprocess effective\u2019; and (3) \u2018the exercise of personal juris-\ndiction must comport with constitutional due process prin-\nciples.\u2019\u201d Schwab Short-Term Bond Mkt. Fund v. Lloyds \nBanking Grp. PLC, 22 F.4th 103, 121 (2d Cir. 2021) (quot-\ning Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 327\u201328). In this case, the par-\nties do not dispute that the first and second requirements \nwere waived and satisfied, respectively.5 See Fuld, 578 F. \nSupp. 3d at 583. We therefore consider only the third re-\nquirement \u2014 \u201cwhether jurisdiction over the defendants \nmay be exercised consistent with the Constitution.\u201d Wald-\nman I, 835 F.3d at 328. \nThe principle that a court must have personal juris-\ndiction over a defendant \u201crecognizes and protects an indi-\nvidual liberty interest\u201d flowing from the Constitution\u2019s \nguarantees of due process. Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \n \n5 Specifically, the defendants \u201cwaived any defenses regarding proper \nservice of process,\u201d and with respect to the second requirement, the \ndefendants do not dispute that they \u201cmade payments\u201d sufficient to \nsatisfy the PSJVTA\u2019s first statutory prong for \u201cdeemed consent.\u201d \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 583. \n\n17a \n \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 \n(1982). As we explained in Waldman I, that principle ex-\ntends to both the PLO and the PA, each of whom enjoys a \ndue process right \u201cto be subject only to [a court\u2019s] lawful \npower.\u201d 835 F.3d at 328\u201329 (citing J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. \nv. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion)). \nIn particular, constitutional due process ensures that a \ncourt will exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nonly if \u201cthe maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tradi-\ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Int\u2019l \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting \nMilliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). The Supreme \nCourt\u2019s precedents discussing that requirement, including \nits canonical opinion in International Shoe, have arisen \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment \u2014 a constraint on the power of state tribunals. See \nU.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; see also Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 \nU.S. at 311. But we have previously explained that the per-\nsonal jurisdiction analysis is \u201cbasically the same\u201d under \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which limits \nthe power of the federal courts and governs the inquiry \nhere.6 Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see U.S. CONST. amend. V. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized three distinct ba-\nses for exercising personal jurisdiction over an out-of-fo-\nrum defendant in accordance with the dictates of due pro-\ncess: general jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction, and con-\nsent. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. \n \n6 As noted above, the \u201cprincipal difference\u201d between these due pro-\ncess standards arises in the context of a minimum-contacts inquiry: \nthe analysis under the Fourteenth Amendment is limited to the de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state, while the Fifth Amendment \npermits consideration of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the United \nStates as a whole. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330 (citing Chew, 143 F.3d \nat 28 n.4). \n\n18a \n \n462, 472\u201373 & 472 n.14 (1985); J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. \nat 880\u201381 (plurality opinion). The first two bases, \u201cgeneral \n(sometimes called all-purpose) jurisdiction and specific \n(sometimes called case-linked) jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cgiv[e] con-\ntent\u201d to the holding of International Shoe, which estab-\nlished that a court may hear claims against a defendant \nwho has not submitted to its authority only where the de-\nfendant has certain \u201ccontacts\u201d with the forum. Ford Motor \nCo. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 \n(2021); see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. \nBrown, 564 U.S. 915, 923\u2013 24 (2011); Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. \nat 316. General jurisdiction, as its name suggests, allows a \ncourt to hear \u201cany and all claims\u201d against a defendant \u2014 \nbut, for businesses and organizations, only when that de-\nfendant is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in the forum. Ford, 141 S. \nCt. at 1024 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919); see Daim-\nler, 571 U.S. at 127. Specific jurisdiction, in contrast, co-\nvers a \u201cnarrower class of claims,\u201d Ford, 141 S. Ct. at 1024, \nand depends \u201con the relationship among the defendant, \nthe forum, and the litigation,\u201d Walden, 571 U.S. at 284 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). In particular, a court \nmay exercise specific jurisdiction if the defendant has \n\u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting \nactivities within the forum,\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 253 (1958), or if the defendant has intentionally di-\nrected wrongdoing at the forum, Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. \n783, 790 (1984). Even then, the court\u2019s authority is limited \nsolely to claims that \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d the defend-\nant\u2019s forum contacts. Ford, 141 S. Ct. at 1025 (quoting \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. \n255, 262 (2017)); see Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472\u201373. \nNeither of those two bases for personal jurisdiction is \nat issue here. In the proceedings before the district court, \nthe plaintiffs never argued for general or specific jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and the PA. Nor do they contest the \n\n19a \n \ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[a]ny such argument \nwould be foreclosed by . . . Waldman I.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. \n3d at 584. Instead, the plaintiffs rely exclusively on con-\nsent, the third independent basis for exercising personal \njurisdiction over an out-of-forum defendant. See Ins. Corp. \nof Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472 \n& n.14. The plaintiffs contend that the PLO and the PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nthis civil ATA action pursuant to the PSJVTA, because en-\ngaging in the statute\u2019s predicate conduct amounts to \u201cim-\nplied\u201d or \u201cconstructive\u201d consent. See, e.g., Pls.\u2019 Br. at 13. \nBoth the plaintiffs and the Government argue that the \nPSJVTA establishes consent-based jurisdiction in accord-\nance with due process principles, and that the district \ncourt erred in holding otherwise. \nWe disagree. For the reasons set forth below, we con-\nclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision is in-\nconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Because the statute does not establish a fed-\neral court\u2019s authority over the PLO and the PA consistent \nwith the Fifth Amendment\u2019s requirement of due process, \nthis case against those defendants was properly dismissed \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. \nA. \nConsent to personal jurisdiction is a voluntary agree-\nment on the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular \nforum. See Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n311, 316 (1964) (a defendant \u201cmay agree . . . to submit to \nthe jurisdiction of a given court\u201d); J. McIntyre Mach., 564 \nU.S. at 880\u201381 (plurality opinion) (\u201cexplicit consent\u201d is \namong the \u201ccircumstances, or . . . course[s] of conduct, \nfrom which it is proper to infer . . . an intention to submit \nto the laws of the forum\u201d); Knowlton v. Allied Van Lines, \nInc., 900 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1990) (\u201cA defendant may \n\n20a \n \nvoluntarily consent or submit to the jurisdiction of a court \nwhich otherwise would not have jurisdiction over it.\u201d). In \nseveral of its decisions, including, most recently, Mallory \nv. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 143 S. Ct. 2028 (2023), \nthe Supreme Court has explained why such consent suf-\nfices to establish personal jurisdiction: \u201cBecause the [due \nprocess] requirement of personal jurisdiction [is] first of \nall an individual right, it can, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; see Burger \nKing, 471 U.S. at 472 n.14 (\u201c[T]he personal jurisdiction re-\nquirement is a waivable right[.]\u201d); Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at \n2043 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is a per-\nsonal defense that may be waived or forfeited.\u201d (emphasis \nin original)); id. at 2051 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment) (\u201cIf a person voluntarily \nwaives th[e] [personal jurisdiction] right, that choice \nshould be honored.\u201d). Thus, when a defendant has validly \nconsented to personal jurisdiction, a court may exercise \nauthority over that defendant in conformity with the Due \nProcess Clause, even in the absence of general or specific \njurisdiction. See, e.g., Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2039 (plurality \nopinion) (explaining that \u201cconsent can . . . ground personal \njurisdiction\u201d apart from a defendant\u2019s forum contacts (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted)); see also Knowlton, 900 \nF.2d at 1199. \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a \u201cvariety of legal \narrangements [that] have been taken to represent express \nor implied consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703; see \nMallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2038 n.5 (majority opinion). For ex-\nample, a defendant\u2019s consent to personal jurisdiction may \nbe implied based on litigation-related conduct, or where a \ndefendant accepts a benefit from the forum in exchange \nfor its amenability to suit in the forum\u2019s courts. See, e.g., \nIns. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201305; Mallory, 143 S. \n\n21a \n \nCt. at 2033 (majority opinion); id. at 2041 n.8 (plurality \nopinion). In such cases, it is often fair and reasonable to \ninfer the defendant\u2019s voluntary agreement to submit itself \nto a court\u2019s authority. But consent cannot be found based \nsolely on a government decree pronouncing that activities \nunrelated to being sued in the forum will be \u201cdeemed\u201d to \nbe \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction there. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); \ncf. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 (distinguishing \nbetween litigation-related conduct that establishes per-\nsonal jurisdiction and \u201cmere assertions of . . . power\u201d over \na defendant (quoting Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 \nU.S. 25, 29 (1917))). A prospective defendant\u2019s activities do \nnot signify consent to personal jurisdiction simply because \nCongress has labeled them as such. \nThus, while \u201c[a] variety of legal arrangements . . . \n[may] represent . . . consent to . . . personal jurisdiction,\u201d \nid. at 703, the PSJVTA is not among them. The PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision for consent-based jurisdiction over the PLO and \nthe PA, in which Congress has \u201cdeemed\u201d the continuation \nof certain conduct to constitute \u201cconsent,\u201d falls outside any \nreasonable construction of valid consent to proceed in a \nparticular forum\u2019s courts. \n1. \nWe begin with some of the \u201cvarious ways\u201d in which \n\u201cconsent may be manifested,\u201d either \u201cby word or [by] \ndeed.\u201d Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2039 (plurality opinion). It is \nwell-established that a defendant may expressly consent \nto personal jurisdiction in a particular court by contract, \nusually through an agreed-upon forum-selection clause. \nSee Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201304; see also Szu-\nkhent, 375 U.S. at 316 (\u201c[P]arties to a contract may agree \nin advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court.\u201d). \nSo long as such \u201cforum-selection provisions have been ob-\ntained through \u2018freely negotiated\u2019 agreements and are not \n\n22a \n \n\u2018unreasonable and unjust,\u2019 their enforcement [against a \ndefendant] does not offend due process.\u201d Burger King, 471 \nU.S. at 472 n.14 (quoting Bremen v. Zapata Off- Shore Co., \n407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972)); see also Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. \nv. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991) (\u201c[F]orum selection \nclauses . . . are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental \nfairness.\u201d). Likewise, a court may exercise authority over \na defendant on the basis of express consent provided in a \nstipulation. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704; \nPetrowski v. Hawkeye-Sec. Co., 350 U.S. 495, 496 (1956) \n(per curiam) (\u201c[The] respondent, by its stipulation, waived \nany right to assert a lack of personal jurisdiction over it.\u201d). \nThe Supreme Court has acknowledged that a defend-\nant may, in certain circumstances, impliedly consent to \npersonal jurisdiction through litigation- related conduct. \nSee, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703\u201305. Such \nconduct includes a defendant\u2019s voluntary in-court appear-\nance, see id. at 703, unless the defendant has appeared for \nthe limited purpose of contesting personal jurisdiction (in \nwhich case, the defendant typically preserves the de-\nfense), see Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2044 (plurality opinion). \nMoreover, in keeping with the principle that \u201c[t]he expres-\nsion of legal rights is often subject to certain procedural \nrules,\u201d a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow [such] rules\u201d with \nregard to personal jurisdiction may \u201cresult in a curtail-\nment of [its] right[]\u201d to enforce that requirement. Ins. \nCorp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705. \u201cThus, the failure to en-\nter a timely objection to personal jurisdiction constitutes, \nunder Rule 12(h)(1), a waiver of the objection.\u201d Id. Simi-\nlarly, a defendant\u2019s failure to comply with certain pretrial \norders concerning jurisdictional discovery may justify a \n\u201csanction under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) consisting of a finding of \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court has found \nthat other litigation activities can subject a litigant to \n\n23a \n \npersonal jurisdiction as well. See, e.g., id. at 704; Leman v. \nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U.S. 448, 451 (1932).7  \nThe Supreme Court has also recognized that a pro-\nspective defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction \nif it has accepted a government benefit from the forum, in \n \n7 Among these other examples, the only instances in which findings \nof \u201cimplied consent\u201d have been premised on a defendant\u2019s omission \nare those where the defendant \u201cfail[ed] to follow\u201d litigation rules and \norders related to personal jurisdiction, Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. \nat 703, 705, and thereby \u201cforfeited\u201d \u2014 rather than waived \u2014 the de-\nfense. See, e.g., City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 \nF.3d 114, 133\u201334, 135 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction . . . can . . . \nbe purposely waived or inadvertently forfeited. . . . [A] defendant for-\nfeits its jurisdictional defense if it appears before a district court to \npress that defense but then willfully withdraws from the litigation and \ndefaults[.]\u201d); Hamilton v. Atlas Turner, Inc., 197 F.3d 58, 61\u201362 (2d \nCir. 1999) (\u201cWhereas forfeiture is the failure to make the timely as-\nsertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandon-\nment of a known right. . . . [The defendant] participated in pretrial \nproceedings but never moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion despite several clear opportunities to do so during the four-year \ninterval after filing its answer. These circumstances establish a forfei-\nture.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). It can be said \nthat in failing to follow such rules or orders, a defendant effectively \nconcedes the issue. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705, 709 \n(where noncompliance with litigation rules and orders supports a \n\u201cpresumption of fact\u201d as to the \u201cwant of merit in the asserted [per-\nsonal jurisdiction] defense,\u201d \u201c[t]he preservation of due process [is] se-\ncured\u201d (quoting Hammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, \n350\u201351 (1909))). While forfeiture of a personal jurisdiction defense \nmay be the product of mistake or inadvertence, rather than affirma-\ntive conduct evincing agreement, the Supreme Court has counted \nsuch forfeitures among the \u201clegal arrangements [that] have been \ntaken to represent . . . implied consent to . . . personal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 703. But beyond these forfeitures in the context of litigation, the \nexisting precedent suggests that the conduct necessary to support an \ninference of implied consent, whether related to the litigation or not, \nmust be some \u201cintentional[]\u201d act that can reasonably be construed as \na waiver of the personal jurisdiction requirement. Id. at 704. \n\n24a \n \nreturn for which the defendant is required to submit itself \nto suit in the forum. See Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2044 (plu-\nrality opinion) (explaining that personal jurisdiction may \nexist where the defendant has \u201caccept[ed] an in-state ben-\nefit with jurisdictional strings attached\u201d). The Supreme \nCourt\u2019s recent decision in Mallory highlighted such an ar-\nrangement: Mallory approved the exercise of consent-\nbased jurisdiction pursuant to a state business registra-\ntion statute that \u201crequire[d] an out-of-state firm to answer \nany suits against it in exchange for status as a registered \nforeign corporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d Id. at \n2033 (majority opinion). A plurality of the Justices noted \nthat this sort of \u201cexchange\u201d between the defendant and \nthe forum \u2014 in other words, \u201cconsent to suit in exchange \nfor access to a State\u2019s markets\u201d \u2014 \u201ccan signal consent to \njurisdiction\u201d in at least some cases. Id. at 2041 n.8 (plural-\nity opinion) (alterations adopted). \nThe litigation-related activities or reciprocal bargains \ndescribed above, just like \u201cexplicit consent,\u201d can supply a \nbasis \u201cfrom which it is proper to infer . . . an intention to \nsubmit\u201d to the forum, J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 880\u2013\n81 (plurality opinion), or are otherwise \u201cof such a nature \nas to justify the fiction\u201d of consent to a court\u2019s authority, \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318; see also Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 705 (explaining, with regard to litigation con-\nduct, that \u201cdue process [is] secured\u201d where the conduct \nsupports a \u201cpresumption of fact\u201d as to the existence of per-\nsonal jurisdiction). Under such circumstances, the asser-\ntion of consent-based personal jurisdiction does \u201cnot of-\nfend traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice,\u201d and is therefore consistent with constitutional due \nprocess. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702\u201303 (quoting \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316). \n\n25a \n \n2. \nThe appellants argue that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision subjects the PLO and the PA to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in a manner consistent with due process \nlimits. But the statute\u2019s terms are insufficient to establish \nthe defendants\u2019 valid consent, either express or implied, to \nwaive their constitutional right not to be sued in a court \nthat lacks personal jurisdiction over them. \nIt is undisputed that this case does not involve a de-\nfendant\u2019s express consent in any form \u2014 and for that rea-\nson, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a finding of consent \u201cfol-\nlows a fortiori from\u201d Carnival Cruise is misplaced. See \nPls.\u2019 Br. at 12\u2013 13, 28\u201329. In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that a specific forum-selection clause in a cruise ticket \nwas enforceable against the parties who had assented to \nthe agreement at issue. See Carnival Cruise, 499 U.S. at \n587\u201389. The decision in Carnival Cruise did not \u201cinfer[] \nconsent\u201d at all, see Pls.\u2019 Br. at 27\u201329, but instead enforced \nthe express jurisdiction-conferring language of a contract \nafter accounting for considerations of notice and funda-\nmental fairness.8 See Carnival Cruise, 499 U.S. at 593\u201395. \nThe appellants characterize the PSJVTA as establish-\ning implied consent, but the statute provides no basis for \na finding that the defendants have agreed to submit to the \njurisdiction of the United States courts. The PSJVTA does \nnot purport to determine that any litigation-related con-\nduct on the part of the PLO or the PA constitutes implied \nconsent to jurisdiction. Nor does the PSJVTA require sub-\nmission to the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction in exchange for, \n \n8 The plaintiffs also rely on Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311. But Szukhent \nconcerned the validity under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of \na contract provision that expressly appointed an agent for service of \nprocess. Id. at 315. As in Carnival Cruise, Szukhent enforced the ex-\npress terms of a contract. No express contract is at issue here. \n\n26a \n \nor as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit or \nprivilege. Instead, Congress selected certain non-litiga-\ntion activities in which the PLO and the PA had already \nengaged (or were alleged to have engaged) and decreed \nthat those activities, if continued or resumed after a cer-\ntain date, \u201cshall be deemed\u201d to constitute \u201cconsent[] to \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); see, e.g., \nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1123\u201324, 1127, 1129\u201330 (describing \nallegations of PLO and PA activity in the United States); \nTaylor Force Act \u00a7 1002, 132 Stat. at 1143 (discussing the \nrelevant payments). The defendants\u2019 support for terror-\nism not targeted at the United States and their limited ac-\ntivities within the United States have already been found \nto be insufficient to establish general or specific jurisdic-\ntion over the PLO and the PA in similar ATA cases, see, \ne.g., Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 339\u201342, and those same activ-\nities cannot reasonably be interpreted as signaling the de-\nfendants\u2019 \u201cintention to submit\u201d to the authority of the \nUnited States courts, see J. McIntyre Mach., 56 U.S. at \n881 (plurality opinion). Rather, such activities allegedly \nconstitute \u201cconsent\u201d under the PSJVTA only because \nCongress has labeled them that way. Thus, under the stat-\nute, the defendants incur a jurisdictional penalty for the \ncontinuation of conduct that they were known to partake \nin before the PSJVTA\u2019s enactment \u2014 conduct which, on \nits own, cannot support a fair and reasonable inference of \nthe defendants\u2019 voluntary agreement to proceed in a fed-\neral forum. This declaration of purported consent, predi-\ncated on conduct lacking any of the indicia of valid consent \npreviously recognized in the case law, fails to satisfy con-\nstitutional due process. \nPursuant to the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong, the PLO and \nthe PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d for \u201cmak[ing] any payment\u201d to the designees of \nincarcerated terrorists, or to the families of deceased \n\n27a \n \nterrorists, whose acts of terror \u201cinjured or killed a national \nof the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). This spe-\ncific non-litigation conduct cannot reasonably be under-\nstood as signaling the defendants\u2019 agreement to submit to \nthe United States courts. Accordingly, the effect of the \nfirst prong is to subject the defendants to a jurisdictional \nsanction \u2014 \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to the federal courts\u2019 au-\nthority \u2014 for continuing to make the payments at issue. \nIllustrating the point, the appellants themselves repeat-\nedly emphasize that the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong serves to \ndeter a congressionally disfavored activity. See, e.g., Pls.\u2019 \nBr. at 11 (the first prong \u201cincentivizes [the] [d]efendants \nto halt the universally condemned practice of making [the] \npayments\u201d at issue); Intervenor Br. at 25\u201326 (the first \nprong \u201cdiscourage[s]\u201d payments that Congress has linked \nto terrorist activity). But Congress has a variety of other \ntools at its disposal for discouraging the payments in ques-\ntion. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378c-1(a)(1)(B) (barring certain \nU.S. foreign aid that \u201cdirectly benefits\u201d the PA until both \nthe PLO and the PA have \u201cterminated\u201d the relevant pay-\nments). Imposing consent to personal jurisdiction as a con-\nsequence for those payments, and thereby divesting the \ndefendants of their Fifth Amendment liberty interest, is \nnot among them. \nThe second prong of the PSJVTA similarly specifies \npredicate conduct that does not evince the defendants\u2019 \nagreement to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States courts. This prong provides that the PLO \nand the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction\u201d for \u201cmaintain[ing] any office\u201d or \u201ccon-\nduct[ing] any activity while physically present in the \nUnited States,\u201d with a limited set of exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The appellants repeatedly suggest that \nthis prong is consistent with relevant precedents because \nit \u201c[c]ondition[s] permission\u201d for the defendants to engage \n\n28a \n \nin such activities, and to receive the attendant benefits of \ndoing so, \u201con their consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA \nactions.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 24; see Pls.\u2019 Br. at 48 (the de-\nfendants\u2019 \u201creceipt of [certain] benefits\u201d is \u201ccondition[ed] . \n. . on their consent\u201d). But this characterization is inaccu-\nrate, given that the statute does not provide the PLO or \nthe PA with any such benefit or permission. With the ex-\nception of UN-related conduct and offices, which are pro-\ntected pursuant to international treaty (and which, as set \nforth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3), are exempt from the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong), federal law has long prohibited \nthe defendants from engaging in any activities or main-\ntaining any offices in the United States, absent specific ex-\necutive or statutory waivers.9 See, e.g., Klinghoffer v. \n \n9 For example, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 imposes a \u201cwide \ngauged restriction of PLO activity within the United States [that], de-\npending on the nature of its enforcement, could effectively curtail any \nPLO activities in the United States, aside from the Mission to the \nUnited Nations.\u201d Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F.

See Intervenor Br. at 24\u201325 (citing relevant waiver provi-\nsions); see also Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1129\u201331 (describing the \u201cformal \n. . . waiver procedure\u201d applicable to 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202). \n\n29a \n \nS.N.C.

The \nPSJVTA does not purport to relax or override these pro-\nhibitions, and the appellants have not identified any other \nchange in existing law (for example, a statutory or execu-\ntive waiver) that would otherwise authorize the restricted \nconduct. Thus, the statute\u2019s second prong cannot reasona-\nbly be construed as requiring a defendant\u2019s consent to ju-\nrisdiction in exchange for permission to engage in the \npredicate activities, because the defendants have not been \ngranted permission to engage in those activities at all.10 In-\nstead, the second prong exacts \u201cdeemed\u201d consent as a \nprice to be paid upon \u201cconduct[ing] [such] activit[ies],\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B), without conferring any rights or \nbenefits on the defendants in return. \nThe appellants argue that the PSJVTA is constitu-\ntionally sound because it gives the defendants \u201cfair \n \n10 The appellants do not dispute that the defendants are statutorily \nbarred from conducting activities in the United States. Rather, the \nplaintiffs suggest that the Government has historically permitted cer-\ntain activities as \u201ca matter of grace,\u201d thereby allowing the Govern-\nment to require consent in return. Pls.\u2019 Reply Br. at 25. But the Gov-\nernment retains the authority to enforce the relevant prohibitions and \ncould exercise it at any time. See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5203 (authorizing the \nAttorney General to take any \u201cnecessary steps,\u201d including \u201clegal ac-\ntion,\u201d to enforce the restrictions as to the PLO); PATA \u00a7 7(b), 120 Stat. \nat 3324 (same as to the PA). Turning a blind eye to prohibited conduct \nthat remains subject to sanction or curtailment is not the same as au-\nthorizing such conduct. Cf. Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1131 (rejecting an \nattempt to \u201cequate [a] government \u2018failure to prosecute\u2019\u201d certain ac-\ntivities under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 with the \u201cwaiver or suspension\u201d of the \nrestrictions of those activities, for purposes of an analysis under the \nATCA). \n\n30a \n \nwarning\u201d of the relevant jurisdiction-triggering conduct \nand \u201creasonably advances legitimate government inter-\nests in the context of our federal system.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 11. \nThey derive this standard from a variety of cases describ-\ning basic principles of due process, including the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s decisions on specific jurisdiction in Ford Motor \nCo., 141 S. Ct. 1017, and Burger King, 471 U.S. 462. How-\never, the concepts of \u201cfair warning\u201d and \u201clegitimate gov-\nernment interests\u201d establish only minimum due process \nrequirements. These generalizations about due process do \nnot resolve the precise issue in this case, which is whether \nthe defendants have consented to suit in the absence of \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction. None of the cases on which \nthe appellants rely to support their broad due process test \npurported to answer that question.11  \nTellingly, the appellants have cited no case implying \nconsent to personal jurisdiction under circumstances sim-\nilar to those in this action. Instead, all of the appellants\u2019 \nauthorities concerning such implied consent involved a de-\nfendant\u2019s litigation-related conduct, or a defendant\u2019s ac-\nceptance of some in-forum benefit conditioned on amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts. Those cases premised \nconsent on activities from which it was reasonable to infer \n \n11 The plaintiffs also argue that the district court\u2019s analysis was \nflawed because it referred to the right at issue here, the due process \nright not to be haled into a forum lacking personal jurisdiction, as a \n\u201cfundamental constitutional right.\u201d See Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 580, \n591. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201ccertain fundamental \nrights\u201d trigger \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 720 (1997), and accordingly, the plaintiffs suggest that the \ndistrict court must have applied an unduly strict standard in this case. \nThese arguments are without merit. The district court was plainly us-\ning the phrase \u201cfundamental\u201d in a colloquial sense, not as a formal \nclassification or a term of art, and we see no indication that the district \ncourt applied an inappropriately rigorous standard of scrutiny. \n\n31a \n \na defendant\u2019s submission to personal jurisdiction, but that \nis not the situation here. \nFor example, in Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a \ndecision that the appellants have relied on extensively, a \ndefendant appeared before the district court to assert a \npersonal jurisdiction defense, but then repeatedly failed to \ncomply with discovery orders \u201cdirected at establishing ju-\nrisdictional facts\u201d related to its contacts with the forum. \n456 U.S. at 695; see id. at 698\u201399. The district court accord-\ningly imposed a discovery sanction pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A), which provides that \ncertain facts may \u201cbe taken as established\u201d when a party \n\u201cfails to obey a[] [discovery] order\u201d concerning those facts. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A). Consistent with that Rule, the \ndistrict court treated the nonresident defendant\u2019s forum \ncontacts as having been proven, which in turn established \npersonal jurisdiction. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at \n695, 699. \nThe Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argu-\nment that this discovery sanction violated due process. Id. \nat 696. Relying on its previous decision in Hammond \nPacking Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322 (1909), the Su-\npreme Court explained that the \u201cpreservation of due pro-\ncess was secured by the presumption that the refusal to \nproduce evidence material to the administration of due \nprocess was but an admission of the want of merit in the \nasserted defense.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 \n(quoting Hammond Packing, 212 U.S. at 350\u201351). In other \nwords, the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to supply the requested in-\nformation as to its contacts with [the forum],\u201d after \u201c[h]av-\ning put the issue in question,\u201d could fairly be construed as \na tacit acknowledgment that the sought-after facts would \nestablish personal jurisdiction. Id. at 709. \n\n32a \n \nThe current case bears no resemblance to Insurance \nCorporation of Ireland. In contrast to the \u201cactions of the \ndefendant\u201d at issue there, id. at 704, the relevant conduct \nunder the PSJVTA takes place entirely outside of the liti-\ngation. Moreover, the Supreme Court made clear that the \napplication of the Hammond Packing presumption in In-\nsurance Corporation of Ireland, along with the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction that followed from it, was appropri-\nate only because the defendant\u2019s litigation conduct related \nto whether personal jurisdiction existed. To underscore \nthe point, the Supreme Court distinguished Hovey v. El-\nliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), which held that due process was \nviolated where a court rendered judgment against a de-\nfendant \u201cas \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure\u201d to pay a certain fee \n\u2014 conduct plainly unrelated to any \u201casserted defense\u201d in \nthat case. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705\u201306. The \neffect of the PSJVTA is similar: the statute subjects the \ndefendants to the authority of the federal courts for en-\ngaging in conduct with no connection to the establishment \nof personal jurisdiction, and indeed with no connection to \nlitigation in the United States at all. \nWith respect to non-litigation conduct, the appellants \nrely heavily on cases finding consent to jurisdiction based \non business registration statutes, which the plaintiffs de-\nscribed at oral argument as \u201cno different\u201d from the \nPSJVTA. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision \nin Mallory makes plain why those statutes are readily dis-\ntinguishable. Mallory arose out of a Virginia resident\u2019s \nlawsuit in Pennsylvania state court against his former em-\nployer, a Virginia railroad corporation, for damages sus-\ntained as a result of work in Virginia and Ohio. See 143 S. \nCt. at 2032\u201333. The plaintiff argued that the defendant had \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania when it \nregistered as a foreign corporation under Pennsylvania \nlaw, which \u201crequires out-of-state companies that register \n\n33a \n \nto do business in the [state] to agree to appear in its courts \non \u2018any cause of action\u2019 against them.\u201d Id. at 2033 (quoting \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i), (b) (2019)); see also id. at \n2037 (noting that the Pennsylvania statute \u201cexplicit[ly]\u201d \nprovides for general jurisdiction over registered foreign \ncorporations). The defendant did not dispute that it had \nregistered under the Pennsylvania statute, but it \u201cresisted \n[the plaintiff\u2019s] suit on constitutional grounds,\u201d raising the \nquestion of \u201cwhether the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment prohibits a State from requiring an \nout-of-state corporation to consent to personal jurisdiction \nto do business there.\u201d Id. at 2033. \nThe Supreme Court rejected this due process chal-\nlenge and held that the defendant was subject to jurisdic-\ntion in Pennsylvania based on the state\u2019s business regis-\ntration statute. See id. at 2032, 2037\u201338. The majority rea-\nsoned that the case fell \u201csquarely within [the] rule\u201d of \nPennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), see Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at \n2038, which, in the words of the plurality, established that \nthe type of business registration statute at issue \u201ccom-\nport[s] with the Due Process Clause,\u201d id. at 2033 (plurality \nopinion). Pennsylvania Fire specifically upheld the exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction pursuant to a Missouri state \nlaw \u201crequir[ing] any out-of-state insurance company de-\nsiring to transact any business in the State to . . . accept \nservice on [a particular state] official as valid in any suit.\u201d \nId. at 2036 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). In that case, \u201cthere was \u2018no doubt\u2019 [the out-of-\nstate insurance company] could be sued in Missouri by an \nout-of-state plaintiff on an out-of-state contract,\u201d because \nthe corporation \u201chad agreed to accept service of process in \nMissouri on any suit as a condition of doing business \nthere.\u201d Id. (plurality opinion) (quoting Pennsylvania Fire, \n243 U.S. at 95). \n\n34a \n \nThat language \u2014 \u201cas a condition of doing business \nthere\u201d \u2014 explains why the statutes at issue in both Penn-\nsylvania Fire and Mallory could support a finding of im-\nplied consent to personal jurisdiction. Consent may be \nfairly inferred when a prospective defendant \u201cvoluntarily \ninvoke[s] certain [in-forum] benefits . . . conditioned on \nsubmitting to the [forum\u2019s] jurisdiction,\u201d because the ac-\nceptance of the benefit implicitly signals the defendant\u2019s \nagreement to appear in the forum\u2019s courts. Id. at 2045 \n(Jackson, J., concurring). Put differently, a defendant may \ngive its consent as part of a bargain: the defendant seeks \nand obtains a benefit that the forum has to offer, and the \ndefendant agrees to be sued in that jurisdiction in ex-\nchange. Thus, the statute at issue in Mallory supported a \nfinding of consent to jurisdiction because it \u201cgave the [de-\nfendant] the right to do business in-state in return for \nagreeing to answer any suit against it.\u201d 143 S. Ct. at 2041 \n(plurality opinion). Indeed, in discussing why such stat-\nutes count among the \u201clegal arrangements [that] may rep-\nresent . . . implied consent . . . consistent with due process,\u201d \nboth the majority and the plurality referred repeatedly to \nthis sort of \u201cexchange.\u201d12 Id. at 2044 n.10 (plurality \n \n12 See, e.g., Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2041 n.8 (plurality opinion) \n(\u201c[T]hese arrangements can include state laws requiring consent to \nsuit in exchange for access to a State\u2019s markets.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted and alterations adopted)); see also id. at 2033 (majority \nopinion) (\u201cPennsylvania law . . . requires an out-of-state firm to answer \nany suits against it in exchange for status as a registered foreign cor-\nporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d); id. at 2037 (majority opinion) \n(explaining that the registered defendant obtained \u201cboth the benefits \nand burdens shared by domestic corporations \u2014 including amenabil-\nity to suit in state court on any claim,\u201d and that the defendant \u201chas \nagreed to be found in Pennsylvania and answer any suit there\u201d); id. at \n2035 (plurality opinion) (describing a long history of state statutes \u201cre-\nquiring out-of-state corporations to consent to in-state suits in \n\n35a \n \nopinion) (internal quotation marks omitted and alterations \nadopted); see also id. at 2044 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A]ccept-\ning an in-state benefit with jurisdictional strings attached \n. . . can carry with [it] profound consequences for personal \njurisdiction.\u201d). The plurality also stressed the fundamental \nfairness of Mallory\u2019s outcome, given the scale of the de-\nfendant\u2019s operations in the state. See id. at 2041\u201343. Be-\ncause the defendant \u201chad taken full advantage of its op-\nportunity to do business\u201d in the forum, the plurality found \nno due process concern in enforcing its consent to jurisdic-\ntion against it. Id. at 2041. \nMallory therefore underscores the lack of merit in the \nappellants\u2019 asserted analogy between the PSJVTA and \nbusiness registration statutes. The PSJVTA does not re-\nquire that the PLO and the PA consent to jurisdiction as a \ncondition of securing a legal right to do business in the \nUnited States, which remains prohibited under current \nlaw, or to conduct any other presently unauthorized activ-\nity. Indeed, the statute does not offer any in-forum bene-\nfit, right, or privilege that the PLO and the PA could \u201cvol-\nuntarily invoke\u201d in exchange for their submission to the \nfederal courts. Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2045 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring). The defendants in this case cannot be said to \nhave accepted some in-forum benefit in return for an \nagreement to be amenable to suit in the United States.13  \n \nexchange for the rights to exploit the local market and to receive the \nfull range of benefits enjoyed by in-state corporations\u201d). \n13 The plaintiffs contend that we would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d if we en-\ndorsed the \u201cunprecedented\u201d proposition that an in-forum benefit is \nrequired to establish a defendant\u2019s consent to jurisdiction based on \nnon-litigation conduct. Pls.\u2019 July 26, 2023 Supp. Br. at 5, 6. But this \nargument misses the point. The receipt of a benefit from the forum is \nnot a necessary prerequisite to a finding that a defendant has con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction there. Rather, as in Mallory, this sort \nof \u201carrangement[]\u201d \u2014 that is, a defendant\u2019s voluntary acceptance of \n\n36a \n \nThe appellants\u2019 other examples of consent statutes \nare distinguishable on the same grounds. For example, the \nplaintiffs point to the state law at issue in Hess v. Paw-\nloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), which provided that a nonresi-\ndent motorist\u2019s use of the public roads \u201cshall be deemed \nequivalent\u201d to appointing an agent for service of process \nin actions \u201cgrowing out of any accident or collision in which \nsaid nonresident may be involved.\u201d Id. at 354 (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Such a statute conditions \u201cthe \nuse of the highway,\u201d an in-state benefit from which states \nmay \u201cexclude\u201d nonresidents, on the nonresident\u2019s \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction. Id. at 356\u201357. Indeed, the \nstatute itself was phrased in those terms: it stated that \n\u201c[t]he acceptance by a nonresident of the rights and privi-\nleges\u201d associated with \u201coperating a motor vehicle . . . on a \npublic way in the [state]\u201d would be a \u201csignification of his \nagreement\u201d to service. Id. at 354 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The same logic applies to state statutes \nproviding that state courts, in certain classes of cases, can \nexercise consent-based jurisdiction over nonresident offic-\ners and directors of a business incorporated under that \nstate\u2019s laws. See Pls.\u2019 Br. at 29 (citing Hazout v. Tsang \nMun Ting, 134 A.3d 274, 289 (Del. 2016)). In \u201caccepting \nand holding\u201d the position of officer or director, Hazout, \n134 A.3d at 277, a \u201cprivilege\u201d that carries with it \n \nan in-forum benefit conditioned on amenability to suit \u2014 can suffice \nunder the circumstances to \u201csignal consent to jurisdiction.\u201d 143 S. Ct. \nat 2041 n.8 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). In \nother words, such an exchange can serve as a proxy for consent, from \nwhich it may be reasonable and fair to infer an agreement to submit \nto the forum. There are other means of demonstrating consent, such \nas certain litigation-related conduct. See, e.g., Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. 703\u201305. But \u201cdeemed consent,\u201d absent some exchange of ben-\nefits, has never been recognized as a means of valid consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction \n\n37a \n \n\u201csignificant [state-law] benefits and protections,\u201d id. at \n292 n.66 (quoting Armstrong v. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174, \n176 (Del. 1980)), a nonresident can be said to have signaled \nan agreement to the jurisdictional consequences.14  \n \n14 Relying on other cases outside of the personal jurisdiction context, \nthe plaintiffs compare the PSJVTA to \u201cimplied consent laws that re-\nquire motorists . . . to consent to BAC [(blood alcohol content)] testing \nif they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of a drunk-\ndriving offense.\u201d Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013) (plu-\nrality opinion); see, e.g., South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 559 \n(1983) (describing one such statute as \u201cdeclar[ing] that any person op-\nerating a vehicle in [the state] is deemed to have consented to a chem-\nical test of the alcoholic content of his blood if arrested for driving \nwhile intoxicated\u201d). But these statutes, which implicate the Fourth \nAmendment\u2019s protections against unreasonable searches, see \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. at 148\u2013 51, are distinguishable for a variety of rea-\nsons, including those set forth above with regard to Mallory and Hess. \nLike the service-of-process statute considered in Hess, the \u201cimplied \nconsent laws\u201d for suspected drunk drivers require a motorist\u2019s con-\nsent to a particular obligation (specifically, \u201ccooperation with BAC \ntesting\u201d) as \u201ca condition of the privilege of driving on state roads.\u201d \nBirchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U.S. 438, 447\u201348 (2016); see McNeely, \n569 U.S. at 161 (plurality opinion) (noting that \u201call 50 states\u201d have \nadopted laws requiring drivers to consent to BAC testing \u201cas a condi-\ntion of operating a motor vehicle within the State\u201d). That is very dif-\nferent from the statute at issue here, which does not condition the de-\nfendants\u2019 consent on any in-forum privilege at all. \nFurther, the Supreme Court has never actually upheld these so-\ncalled implied consent laws under a consent theory. Rather, the Court \nhas assessed the constitutionality of these laws on a case-by-case ba-\nsis, relying on the exigency exception to the probable cause and war-\nrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment. See Mitchell v. Wiscon-\nsin, 139 S. Ct. 2525, 2532\u201333 (2019) (\u201cBut our decisions have not rested \non the idea that these laws . . . create actual consent to all the searches \nthey authorize.\u201d); see also id. at 2551 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (under-\nscoring that the Supreme Court did not address whether implied con-\nsent was sufficient to authorize the search). These cases, therefore, \nshed little light on when a constitutional right may be waived by im-\nplied consent. \n\n38a \n \nIn short, when a potential defendant accepts a govern-\nment benefit conditioned on submitting to suit in the fo-\nrum, such conduct may fairly be understood as consent to \njurisdiction there. The same is often true when a defend-\nant engages in litigation conduct related to the existence \nof personal jurisdiction. But in the PSJVTA, Congress has \nsimply declared that specific activities of the PLO and the \nPA \u2014 namely, certain payments made outside of the \nUnited States, and certain operations within the United \nStates (which remain unlawful) \u2014 constitute \u201cconsent\u201d to \njurisdiction. No aspect of these allegedly jurisdiction-trig-\ngering activities can reasonably be interpreted as evincing \nthe defendants\u2019 \u201cintention to submit\u201d to the United States \ncourts. J. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion). \nCongress cannot, by legislative fiat, simply \u201cdeem\u201d activi-\nties to be \u201cconsent\u201d when the activities themselves cannot \nplausibly be construed as such. Cf. McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917) (noting that, in \u201cexten[ding] . . . the \nmeans of acquiring [personal] jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cgreat caution \nshould be used not to let fiction deny the fair play that can \nbe secured only by a pretty close adhesion to fact\u201d). \nLike the district court, we need not decide whether, \n\u201cunder different circumstances, Congress or a state legis-\nlature could constitutionally \u2018deem\u2019 certain conduct to be \nconsent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at \n587. But for such a statute to pass muster, \u201cthe predicate \nconduct would have to be a much closer proxy for actual \nconsent than the predicate conduct at issue\u201d here. Id. Be-\ncause the PSJVTA\u2019s predicate activities cannot reasona-\nbly be understood as signifying the defendants\u2019 consent, \nthe statute does not effect a valid waiver of the defendants\u2019 \ndue process protection against the \u201ccoercive power\u201d of a \nforeign forum\u2019s courts. Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918; see \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 328, 329. \n\n39a \n \nB. \nOur conclusion also follows from College Savings \nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Ex-\npense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). That decision concerned \na federal statute, the Trademark Remedy Clarification \nAct (\u201cTRCA\u201d), which provided that states would forgo \ntheir Eleventh Amendment immunity from federal Lan-\nham Act litigation if they committed \u201cany violation\u201d of the \nLanham Act\u2019s prohibitions on false and misleading adver-\ntising. Id. at 670 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1122(b)). As relevant \nhere, the petitioner argued that a state could be said to \nhave \u201c\u2018impliedly\u2019 or \u2018constructively\u2019 waived its immunity\u201d \nupon engaging in the relevant predicate conduct \u2014 \nnamely, \u201cthe activities regulated by the Lanham Act\u201d \u2014 \nafter \u201cbeing put on notice by the clear language of the \nTRCA that it would be subject to [suit] for doing so.\u201d Id. \nat 669, 676, 680. \nThe Supreme Court rejected that proposition. It con-\ncluded that even with \u201cunambiguous[]\u201d advance notice \nfrom Congress, a state\u2019s \u201cvoluntarily elect[ing] to engage \nin the federally regulated conduct\u201d at issue would not suf-\nfice to render the state suable. Id. at 679\u201381. Such conduct, \nthe Supreme Court explained, supplied no basis \u201cto as-\nsume actual consent\u201d to suit in federal court. Id. at 680. To \nhold otherwise would ignore the \u201cfundamental difference \nbetween a State\u2019s expressing unequivocally that it waives \nits immunity\u201d (in which case, one can \u201cbe certain that the \nState in fact consents to suit\u201d) and \u201cCongress\u2019s expressing \nunequivocally its intention that if the State takes certain \naction it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d \nId. at 680\u201381. The decision explained: \nIn the latter situation, the most that can be said with \ncertainty is that the State has been put on notice that \nCongress intends to subject it to suits brought by \n\n40a \n \nindividuals. That is very far from concluding that the \nState made an altogether voluntary decision to waive \nits immunity. \nId. at 681 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). The Supreme Court also saw no merit in the no-\ntion that a state could be \u201cdeemed to have constructively \nwaived its sovereign immunity\u201d simply because \u201cthe as-\nserted basis for [the] waiver [was] conduct that the State \nrealistically could choose to abandon.\u201d Id. at 679, 684. This \nfact, the decision noted, \u201cha[d] no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. at 684. \nThis reasoning underscores the unconstitutionality of \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision. The statute \npurports to extract consent to personal jurisdiction using \nthe very same template that College Savings Bank con-\ndemned in the sovereign immunity context: it identifies ac-\ntivities that, in Congress\u2019s judgment, the PLO and the PA \n\u201crealistically could choose to abandon,\u201d and it \u201cexpress[es] \nunequivocally [Congress\u2019s] intention that if [either defend-\nant] takes [those] action[s] it shall be deemed to have\u201d con-\nsented to a federal court\u2019s authority. Id. at 681, 684. The \nappellants repeatedly contend that this statutory frame-\nwork gives rise to constructive consent because the predi-\ncate conduct is itself \u201cvoluntary,\u201d and the defendants \n\u201cknowing[ly]\u201d continued such conduct with \u201cnotice\u201d of the \nstatute\u2019s terms. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 19\u201320; see Intervenor Br. at 2\u2013\n3. But College Savings Bank rejected that precise theory \nof constructive consent, making clear that the ability to \n\u201cabandon\u201d the relevant predicate conduct \u201cha[s] no bear-\ning upon the voluntariness of the [asserted] waiver.\u201d 527 \nU.S. at 684. Instead, as College Savings Bank explained \nwith regard to the state respondent, \u201cthe most that can be \nsaid\u201d about the defendants here \u201cis that [each] has been \nput on notice that Congress intends to subject it to \n\n41a \n \n[certain] suits\u201d in federal court. Id. at 681. That is a \u201cvery \nfar\u201d cry from an \u201caltogether voluntary decision\u201d on the \npart of either defendant to submit to a court\u2019s jurisdiction. \nSee id. \nThe appellants argue that the logic of College Savings \nBank is inapplicable here because the decision concerned \nthe \u201cspecial context\u201d of state sovereign immunity, where \nthe standard for waiver is \u201cparticularly strict.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at \n30\u201331 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Coll. Sav. \nBank, 527 U.S. at 675 (describing the \u201ctest for determin-\ning whether a State has waived its immunity\u201d as a \u201cstrin-\ngent one\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the rel-\nevant aspects of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning were not \nso cabined. To the contrary, the decision emphasized that \n\u201cconstructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associ-\nated with the surrender of constitutional rights,\u201d and it \nnoted that constructive waivers like the one considered \nthere \u2014 a close match for the sort of \u201cdeemed consent\u201d at \nissue here \u2014 \u201care simply unheard of in the context of . . . \nconstitutionally protected privileges.\u201d 527 U.S. at 681 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted). \nThe Supreme Court illustrated this point with an analogy \nto an entirely different constitutional context: \n  [I]magine if Congress amended the securities laws \nto provide with unmistakable clarity that anyone com-\nmitting fraud in connection with the buying or selling \nof securities in interstate commerce would not be en-\ntitled to a jury in any federal criminal prosecution of \nsuch fraud. Would persons engaging in securities \nfraud after the adoption of such an amendment be \ndeemed to have \u201cconstructively waived\u201d their consti-\ntutionally protected rights to trial by jury in criminal \ncases? After all, the trading of securities is not so vital \nan activity that any one person's decision to trade \n\n42a \n \ncannot be regarded as a voluntary choice. The answer, \nof course, is no. The classic description of an effective \nwaiver of a constitutional right is the intentional relin-\nquishment or abandonment of a known right or privi-\nlege. \nId. at 681\u201382 (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted, alterations adopted). \nThis example was pertinent, the Supreme Court ex-\nplained, because the Eleventh Amendment privilege of \n\u201c[s]tate sovereign immunity, no less than the [Sixth \nAmendment] right to trial by jury in criminal cases, is con-\nstitutionally protected.\u201d Id. at 682. The same is true with \nregard to the \u201cdue process right not to be subjected to \njudgment in [a foreign forum\u2019s] courts,\u201d J. McIntyre \nMach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion), which, like the \nSixth Amendment jury trial right, is a \u201clegal right protect-\ning the individual,\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704. \nThe plaintiffs nevertheless suggest that we should ignore \nthe lessons of College Savings Bank because its general \nstatements regarding waivers of constitutional rights are \nnonbinding \u201cdicta.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 13, 30, 32. But \u201cit does not \nat all follow that we can cavalierly disregard\u201d those state-\nments. United States v. Bell, 524 F.2d 202, 206 (2d Cir. \n1975). Even if Supreme Court dicta do not constitute es-\ntablished law, we nonetheless accord deference to such \ndicta where, as here, no change has occurred in the legal \nlandscape. United States v. Harris, 838 F.3d 98, 107 (2d \nCir. 2016) (citing Newdow v. Peterson, 753 F.3d 105, 108 \nn.3 (2d Cir. 2014)); Bell, 524 F.2d at 206 (noting that Su-\npreme Court dicta \u201cmust be given considerable weight\u201d). \nThat deference is especially warranted in this case, given \nthe close parallels between the PSJVTA and the statutory \nframework that College Savings Bank rejected. \n\n43a \n \nIndeed, the voluminous briefing in this case makes \nclear that the PSJVTA\u2019s approach to deemed consent is \n\u201csimply unheard of,\u201d Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681, be-\ncause those papers, while extensive, fail to identify a single \ncase approving a similar constructive waiver of the per-\nsonal jurisdiction requirement. The briefs instead rely en-\ntirely on personal jurisdiction cases that are inapposite or \ndistinguishable, for all of the reasons discussed above. \nThe appellants also cite various cases involving waiv-\ners of other constitutional rights, but those cases do not \nsupport the constitutionality of the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d im-\nposed in the PSJVTA. For example, in arguing that waiv-\ning a constitutional right does not require any exchange of \nbenefits, the appellants point to United States v. O\u2019Brien, \n926 F.3d 57 (2d Cir. 2019). In O\u2019Brien, however, the de-\nfendant had expressly consented to the warrantless \nsearches of his properties, in writing, rendering that case \na plainly inapt comparison on the question of constructive \nconsent.15 Id. at 77. The appellants\u2019 authorities concerning \nvalid waivers of the Fifth Amendment privilege against \nself-incrimination are similarly far afield. See Moran v. \nBurbine, 475 U.S. 412 (1986); Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. \n298 (1985). The criminal suspects\u2019 actions in those cases, \ntaken upon receiving clear and comprehensive warnings \npursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), left \n\u201cno doubt\u201d (in Moran) or \u201cno question\u201d (in Elstad) that \neach had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Fifth \nAmendment protections. See Moran, 475 U.S. at 417\u201318, \n421\u201322 \n(respondent \nexecuted \n\u201cwritten \nform[s] \n \n15 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 \nU.S. 218 (1973), a case that the plaintiffs cited at oral argument, is \nlikewise distinguishable because it focused on an instance of express \nconsent \u2014 in particular, to the warrantless search of a vehicle. See id. \nat 220. \n\n44a \n \nacknowledging that he understood his [Miranda] \nright[s],\u201d and then gave a free and uncoerced confession); \nElstad, 470 U.S. at 314\u201315, 315 n.4 (respondent gave af-\nfirmative verbal responses confirming that he understood \nhis Miranda rights, then provided a free and uncoerced \ndescription of his offense). \nThe PSJVTA also finds no support in the plaintiffs\u2019 \ncases concerning implied waivers of a litigant\u2019s right to \nproceed before an Article III court. See Wellness Int\u2019l Net-\nwork, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665 (2015); Roell v. Withrow, \n538 U.S. 580 (2003). In these decisions, the Supreme Court \nexplained that such waivers could be fairly inferred based \non specific litigation conduct, namely, \u201cvoluntarily ap-\npear[ing] to try [a] case before [a] non-Article III adjudi-\ncator\u201d after \u201c[being] made aware of the need for consent \nand the right to refuse it.\u201d Wellness Int\u2019l Network, 575 \nU.S. at 685 (internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing \nimplied consent to a bankruptcy judge\u2019s resolution of cer-\ntain claims); Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 n.3, 591 (discussing im-\nplied consent to a magistrate judge\u2019s disposition of an ac-\ntion). Those authorities are unlike this case, where the de-\nfendants have not engaged in any conduct (litigation-re-\nlated or otherwise) evincing an \u201cintention of . . . submitting \nto the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 n.3 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nIn sum, Congress cannot take conduct otherwise in-\nsufficient to support an inference of consent, brand it as \n\u201cconsent,\u201d and then decree that a defendant, after some \ntime has passed, is \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to the loss \nof a due process right for engaging in that conduct. This \nunprecedented framework for consent- based jurisdiction, \npredicated on conduct that is not \u201cof such a nature as to \njustify the fiction\u201d of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d \n\n45a \n \nInt\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 318 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Thus, the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion is incompatible with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause. \nC. \nThe appellants and their amici make various other ar-\nguments in support of the constitutionality of the PSJVTA \nand the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case, none \nof which is persuasive. \nThe Government defends the constitutionality of the \nPSJVTA on the grounds that the predicate conduct at is-\nsue is \u201cclosely linked to the only claim for which personal \njurisdiction is permitted, a civil ATA action concerning at-\ntacks on Americans.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 30. But the rele-\nvant question here is not whether the predicate conduct \nidentified in the statute bears some relation to the activi-\nties proscribed under the ATA, or to Congress\u2019s interest \nin remediating the harms that flow from those activities. \nRather, the question is whether such conduct demon-\nstrates the defendants\u2019 valid consent to the authority of a \nUnited States court. No basis exists to conclude that it \ndoes. \nAlso unpersuasive is the Government\u2019s contention \nthat Congress, in furtherance of an important legislative \npurpose, narrowly tailored the PSJVTA to establish juris-\ndiction over only the PLO, the PA, and their \u201csuccessors \nor affiliates.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 24. Such singling out does \nnot cure a constitutional deficiency. Where, as here, a stat-\nute impinges on constitutional rights, it cannot be salvaged \non the basis that it violates the rights of only a handful of \nsubjects. \nRelatedly, the Government contends that this Court \nmust defer to Congress\u2019s choices in crafting the PSJVTA \nbecause the statute is \u201ccentrally concerned with matters \n\n46a \n \nof foreign affairs,\u201d a realm in which the political branches \nenjoy \u201cbroad authority.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 27. Invalidating \nthe statute, the Government argues, would frustrate leg-\nislative and executive efforts to give full effect to the \nATA\u2019s civil liability provisions, which comprise part of the \nnation\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive legal response to international \nterrorism.\u201d Id. at 22\u201323 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). It is true, of course, that when \u201csensitive interests in \nnational security and foreign affairs [are] at stake,\u201d the \npolicy judgments of both Congress and the Executive are \n\u201centitled to significant weight.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian \nLaw Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36 (2010). But it is equally true \nthat the Government\u2019s broad \u201cforeign affairs power . . . , \n\u2018like every other governmental power, must be exercised \nin subordination to the applicable provisions of the Consti-\ntution.\u2019\u201d Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 416 \nn.9 (2003) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. \nCorp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). Indeed, \u201c[o]ur deference \nin matters of policy cannot . . . become abdication in mat-\nters of law,\u201d and \u201c[o]ur respect for Congress\u2019s policy judg-\nments . . . can never extend so far as to disavow restraints \non federal power that the Constitution carefully con-\nstructed.\u201d Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 538 (2012). \nThus, a statute \u201ccannot create personal jurisdiction \nwhere the Constitution forbids it.\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks \non Sept. 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal \nquotation marks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by \nSamantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305 (2010); accord Glencore \nGrain Rotterdam B.V. v. Shivnath Rai Harnarain Co., \n284 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002); Price v. Socialist Peo-\nple\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 95 (D.C. Cir. \n2002). Because the PSJVTA purports to provide consent-\nbased jurisdiction in a manner at odds with constitutional \ndue process, the statute cannot stand, notwithstanding the \n\n47a \n \npolicy concerns that motivated its enactment. See Nat\u2019l \nFed\u2019n of Indep. Bus., 567 U.S. at 538 (\u201c[T]here can be no \nquestion that it is the responsibility of th[e] Court to en-\nforce the limits on federal power by striking down acts of \nCongress that transgress those limits.\u201d). \nThe appellants also urge us to depart from our prior \nholding that the due process analyses under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments parallel one another in civil \ncases, see Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 330, and to embrace in-\nstead the view that the Fifth Amendment imposes com-\nparatively looser requirements for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction. For its part, the Government argues that \nCongress, as compared to state legislatures subject to the \nFourteenth Amendment, should be permitted under the \nFifth Amendment to authorize \u201ca greater scope of per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d where it wishes to facilitate federal ad-\njudication of certain \u201clegal claims.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 39\u2013\n40. As the basis for this position, the Government contends \nthat the Supreme Court \u201chas tied the limitations of its \nFourteenth Amendment personal jurisdiction jurispru-\ndence\u201d to interstate federalism concerns, which do not \nsimilarly constrain the exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative \npower. Id. at 37\u201338. Under the Government\u2019s theory, the \nFifth Amendment subjects Congress to a more lenient due \nprocess standard, allowing it to enact the sort of \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision featured in the PSJVTA \u2014 \u201c[e]ven if,\u201d \ndue to their limited sovereignty, \u201cstate[s] could not enact \nsimilar legislation consistent with the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.\u201d Id. at 40. \nThe short answer to this argument is that the panel\u2019s \nopinion in Waldman I is the law of the Circuit and cannot \nbe changed unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court or \nby this Court in an en banc or \u201cmini-en banc\u201d decision. See \nUnited States v. Peguero, 34 F.4th 143, 158 & n.9 (2d Cir. \n\n48a \n \n2022). In any event, federalism is not the only constraint \non the exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Douglass v. \nNippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 (5th \nCir. 2022) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Douglass v. \nKaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023) (mem.); Livnat, 851 F.3d at \n55 (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is not just about federalism.\u201d). \nFundamentally, the Constitution\u2019s personal jurisdiction \nrequirements represent a \u201crestrict[ion] [on] judicial \npower\u201d \u2014 and, as a corollary, a restriction on the legisla-\ntive ability to expand that power \u2014 \u201cnot as a matter of \nsovereignty, but as a matter of individual liberty.\u201d J. \nMcIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion) (quot-\ning Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702). Thus, to the ex-\ntent that the need for personal jurisdiction operates as a \nlimit on a state\u2019s sovereign authority, that effect \u201cmust be \nseen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty in-\nterest preserved by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Ins. Corp. \nof Ireland, 456 U.S. at 702 n.10. Relatedly, the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s precedents make clear that one of the \u201cvital pur-\npose[s] of personal-jurisdiction standards,\u201d whether ap-\nplied in state or federal court, \u201cis to ensure fairness to the \ndefendant.\u201d Livnat, 851 F.3d at 55 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted and alteration adopted). \nFor these very reasons, several courts of appeals, in-\ncluding ours, have rejected the notion that federalism\u2019s ir-\nrelevance in the Fifth Amendment context justifies a \n\u201cmore lenient\u201d standard for personal jurisdiction. Wald-\nman I, 835 F.3d at 329\u201330; see, e.g., Livnat, 851 F.3d at \n54\u201355; see also Douglass, 46 F.4th at 236\u201338 (\u201cBecause the \nDue Process Clauses use the same language and guaran-\ntee individual liberty in the same way, it makes sense that \nthe standards developed in the Fourteenth Amendment \ncontext must govern under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). No \nbasis exists to conclude that the same argument, rooted in \nthe absence of federalism-related restrictions on national \n\n49a \n \npower, would warrant relaxing due process constraints on \nCongress\u2019s ability to \u201cdeem[] certain actions . . . to be con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction.\u201d Intervenor Br. at 40. \nWhether premised on contacts or consent, subjecting a \nnonresident defendant to the power of a particular forum \nimplicates compelling concerns for fairness and individual \nliberty, and those \u201cstrong justifications for personal-juris-\ndiction limits apply equally in Fifth Amendment cases.\u201d \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55.16  \nThe plaintiffs take a somewhat different approach to \nthis Fifth Amendment issue: they ask us to invoke our \n\u201c\u2018mini en banc\u2019 process,\u201d overrule Waldman I entirely, \nand embrace the broader Fifth Amendment standard used \nfor personal jurisdiction in criminal cases, so that the dis-\ntrict court may assert \u201cspecific jurisdiction\u201d over the de-\nfendants irrespective of whether the PSJVTA gives rise to \nvalid consent. Pls.\u2019 Br. at 16, 49. Together with their amici, \nthe plaintiffs raise a host of historical, structural, and prac-\ntical considerations, including many of the same federal-\nism-related arguments already rejected above, in an at-\ntempt to secure a more permissive interpretation of the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process limits. \nThese arguments, however, provide no persuasive ba-\nsis for disturbing a binding decision of this Court, espe-\ncially where that decision accords with existing Circuit \ncase law and the overwhelming weight of authority from \n \n16 Moreover, \u201c[j]urisdictional rules should be \u2018simple,\u2019 \u2018easily ascer-\ntainable,\u2019 and \u2018predictable.\u2019\u201d Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56 (alterations \nadopted) (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137). The Government\u2019s pro-\nposal meets none of those criteria. While the Government assures us \nthat not every conceivable \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provision would pass \nmuster under a relaxed Fifth Amendment standard, it fails to identify \nany workable limitation on the \u201cgreater scope\u201d of jurisdiction that \nwould be permitted.

In contending that \nseveral federal courts of appeals have held otherwise, see Pls.\u2019 Br. at \n59\u201360, the plaintiffs rely on outdated authorities, chief among them a \nvacated decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, see Douglass v.

(per curiam), opinion vacated and reh\u2019g en banc \ngranted, 2 F.4th 525 (5th Cir. 2021) (mem.), which subsequently con-\ncluded that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments require the same personal jurisdiction analysis, see 46 \nF.4th 226 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc). The plaintiffs also misstate the \nholdings of other cases, which nowhere suggested that the personal \njurisdiction requirements of the Fifth Amendment are less stringent \nthan those applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., \nPinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., 292 F.3d 361, 370\u201371 & 370 n.2 (3d Cir. \n2002) (invoking Fourteenth Amendment due process \u201cminimum con-\ntacts\u201d standards where the Fifth Amendment applied); see also Peay \nv.

Circuits); see \nalso Livnat, 851 F.3d at 54\u201355 & 55 n.5 (similar). Moreo-\nver, Waldman I was not the first decision of this Court to \napply Fourteenth Amendment due process principles in a \nFifth Amendment context; the analysis there followed \nfrom prior Circuit precedents that \u201cclearly establish[ed] \nthe congruence of [the] due process analysis under both \nthe Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments.\u201d 835 F.3d at 330 \n(citing, among other authorities, Chew, 143 F.3d at 28 n.4, \nand In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, \n673\u201374 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also Porina v.

Therefore, \nwe decline the invitation to abandon our prior ruling and \nupend settled law on the due process standards under the \nFifth Amendment. \nTo the extent the plaintiffs ask us to revisit any other \naspect of our decision in Waldman I, we decline that invi-\ntation as well.

But \u201cthe federal courts cannot exercise \njurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits\u201d of the Due \nProcess Clause, \u201cno matter how horrendous the underly-\ning attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d \nId. at 595\u201396 (quoting Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 344). The \nPSJVTA provides for personal jurisdiction over the PLO \nand the PA in a manner that exceeds those constitutional \nlimits. Because the statute violates due process, the de-\nfendants cannot be \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in this case. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the parties \nand their amici. To the extent not specifically addressed \nabove, those arguments are either moot or without merit. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision regarding \u201cdeemed\u201d consent to personal juris-\ndiction is inconsistent with constitutional due process. Ac-\ncordingly, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against the PLO and \nthe PA was properly dismissed for lack of personal juris-\ndiction, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). The judgment of the \ndistrict court is AFFIRMED. \n\n \n(53a) \nAPPENDIX B \n15-3135-cv (L) \nWaldman v.

This Court concluded on appeal that the \ndistrict court lacked both general and specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and the PA, and we therefore vacated the \njudgment entered against the defendants and remanded \nthe action for dismissal. The plaintiffs later moved to recall \nthe mandate in this case based on a new statute, the Anti-\nTerrorism Clarification Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183. We denied that motion because the stat-\nute\u2019s prerequisites had not been met. \nCongress responded with the statute now at issue, the \nPromoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 \nStat. 2534, 3082. The PSJVTA provides that the PLO and \nthe PA \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d in any civil ATA action if, after a specified \ntime, those entities either (1) make payments, directly \nor indirectly, to the designees or families of incarcerated \nor deceased terrorists, respectively, whose acts of terror \ninjured or killed a United States national, or (2) under-\ntake any activities within the United States, subject to lim-\nited exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).

The district court \n(Daniels, J.) concluded that the defendants had engaged in \njurisdiction-triggering conduct under the statute, but that \nthe PSJVTA violated constitutional due process require-\nments. Both the plaintiffs and the Government now dis-\npute the latter conclusion, and the plaintiffs argue gener-\nally that the PSJVTA justifies recalling the mandate. \nIn Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization, __ \nF.4th __, No. 22-76 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2023), which we also \ndecide today, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is inconsistent \nwith the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Thus, no \nbasis exists to recall the mandate in this case, and the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate is DENIED. \n \nKENT A.

See id. \u00a7 2333(a). On appeal from a sub-\nstantial post-trial judgment entered against the defend-\nants, this Court concluded that the district court lacked \nboth general and specific personal jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA. See Waldman v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 835 F.3d 317, 344 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018) (mem.). We accordingly vacated \nthe judgment and remanded the action for dismissal of \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Id. Our mandate issued on Novem-\nber 28, 2016. \nSince that time, Congress has twice enacted statutes \npurporting to establish personal jurisdiction over the PLO \nand the PA on the basis of consent, which, when validly \ngiven, may constitute an independent basis for subjecting \na defendant to suit in a forum lacking general and specific \njurisdiction. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 \nU.S. 462, 472 & n.14 (1985); Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n703\u201304 (1982); see also Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 143 \nS. Ct. 2028, 2039 (2023) (plurality opinion). After the \npassage of the first such statute, the Anti-Terrorism \nClarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183, the plaintiffs moved to recall the mandate \nin this case. In June 2019, we denied that motion because \nthe ATCA\u2019s prerequisites for personal jurisdiction had \n\n60a \n \nnot been satisfied. See Waldman v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 925 F.3d 570, 574\u201376 (2d Cir. 2019) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d) \n(per curiam), cert. granted, judgment vacated sub nom. \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020) (mem.). \nCongress responded with the enactment of the statute \nnow at issue, the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. \n116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082. The PSJVTA pro-\nvides that the PLO and the PA \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any civil ATA action, \nirrespective of \u201cthe date of the occurrence\u201d of the underly-\ning \u201cact of international terrorism,\u201d upon engaging in cer-\ntain forms of post-enactment conduct, namely (1) making \npayments, directly or indirectly, to the designees or fami-\nlies of incarcerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, \nwhose acts of terror injured or killed a United States na-\ntional, or (2) undertaking any activities within the United \nStates, subject to a handful of exceptions. 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nThe Supreme Court vacated and remanded our de-\ncision in Waldman II in light of the PSJVTA\u2019s enact-\nment, see Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. 2714, and we in turn re-\nmanded to the district court for the limited purpose of \nconsidering the new statute\u2019s effect on this case. The \ndistrict court (Daniels, J.) concluded that the defendants \nhad engaged in jurisdiction-triggering conduct under the \nstatute, but that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provi-\nsion violated constitutional due process requirements. The \nplaintiffs dispute the latter conclusion, and they argue gen-\nerally that the PSJVTA justifies recalling this Court\u2019s \nmandate. The Government, as intervenor pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n\n61a \n \n5.1(c), joins the plaintiffs in defending the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutionality. \nWe address the very same constitutional issue \nin Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization,    F.4th   \n, No. 22-76 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2023), which we also decide \ntoday. In Fuld, we conclude that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision \nfor \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction is incon-\nsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment. Thus, the statute cannot be applied to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO or the PA, and as a result, \nno basis exists to recall the mandate in this case. \nI. BACKGROUND \nWe assume familiarity with Waldman I, Waldman \nII, and our decision today in Fuld, which collectively \ndetail the history of this litigation and the relevant \nstatutory background. \nThe plaintiffs commenced this action against the PLO \nand the PA in 2004, invoking the ATA\u2019s civil damages rem-\nedy for \u201cnational[s] of the United States injured . . . by rea-\nson of an act of international terrorism.\u201d1 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a). Throughout the pretrial proceedings, the PLO \nand the PA repeatedly moved to dismiss the claims against \nthem for lack of personal jurisdiction. All of those motions \nwere denied. The district court determined that it could \nexercise general jurisdiction over the defendants, see \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 04-cv-397, 2011 \nWL 1345086, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2011), even after the \nSupreme Court narrowed the applicable test for \n \n1 As explained in Fuld, the PA was established under the 1993 Oslo \nAccords to serve as the non-sovereign and interim governing body of \nparts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d). The PLO, an entity founded in 1964, conducts \nPalestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Permanent Observer to the \nUnited Nations on behalf of the Palestinian people. \n\n62a \n \ngeneral jurisdiction in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014).2 See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. \n04-cv-397, 2014 WL 6811395, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2014). \nAfter a seven-week trial beginning in January \n2015, a jury found the defendants liable for six of the \nterror attacks at issue and awarded damages of $218.5 \nmillion, an amount automatically trebled to $655.5 million \npursuant to the ATA. See Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 322, 324; \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). During the trial and again in post-trial \nbriefing, the defendants unsuccessfully reasserted their \nargument that the case should be dismissed for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. The district court rejected those argu-\nments and entered final judgment. The defendants then \nmade the same arguments on appeal to this Court.  \nIn Waldman I, this Court agreed with the de-\nfendants. The decision explained that the PLO and the \nPA have a Fifth Amendment due process right not to be \nsued in a forum with which they have insufficient contacts, \nsee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 329, and that the personal ju-\nrisdiction analysis is \u201cbasically the same under both the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d id. at 330. Applying \nDaimler, we determined that the district court lacked gen-\neral jurisdiction because the PLO and the PA are not \u201cat \nhome\u201d in the United States, but \u201cin Palestine, where these \nentities are headquartered and from where they are di-\nrected.\u201d Id. at 334 (emphasis omitted) (citing Daimler, 571 \nU.S. at 139 n.20). We also found that the district court could \nnot subject the defendants to specific jurisdiction, given \nthe absence of any \u201csubstantial connection\u201d between their \n\u201csuit-related conduct \u2014 their role in the six terror attacks \nat issue \u2014 [and] . . . the forum.\u201d Id. at 335 (citing Walden v. \n \n2 For procedural reasons not relevant here, the proceedings before \nthe district court are captioned differently, as Sokolow v. Palestine \nLiberation Organization, No. 04-cv-397 (S.D.N.Y.). \n\n63a \n \nFiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014)). Thus, \u201c[t]he district \ncourt could not constitutionally exercise either general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d Id. at \n344. We vacated the judgment of the district court and re-\nmanded the action \u201cwith instructions to dismiss the case \nfor want of personal jurisdiction.\u201d3 Id. at 322. \nOur mandate issued on November 28, 2016. See Judg-\nment Mandate, No. 15-3135, Doc. No. 248 (2d Cir. Nov. 28, \n2016). The plaintiffs then filed a petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari, which was denied in April 2018. See Sokolow, 138 \nS. Ct. at 1438. \nCongress responded to Waldman I and similar deci-\nsions with the enactment of the ATCA, Pub. L. No. 115-253, \n132 Stat. 3183, a precursor to the statute at issue here. The \nATCA amended the ATA to include a new subsection, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), which provided that a defendant \nwould \u201cbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in . . . [a civil ATA] action if,\u201d following a 120-day pe-\nriod after the ATCA\u2019s enactment, the defendant (1) \u201cac-\ncept[ed]\u201d certain \u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from the United \nStates, or (2) \u201cmaintain[ed]\u201d an office \u201cwithin the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States\u201d pursuant to a waiver or suspen-\nsion of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202, a provision barring the PLO from \n \n3 As discussed in Fuld, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit similarly concluded that federal courts \nlacked both general and specific jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA \nin civil ATA cases related to terrorist activity abroad. See Livnat v. \nPalestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 54\u201358 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (concluding \nthat exercising general or specific jurisdiction over the PA would not \n\u201cmeet the requirements of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause\u201d), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 373 (2018) (mem.); see also Shatsky v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 955 F.3d 1016, 1036\u201337 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(same as to both the PLO and the PA); Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian \nAuth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1123\u201326 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (same), judgment va-\ncated on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 2713 (2020) (mem.), opinion rein-\nstated in part, 820 F. App\u2019x 11 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (mem.). \n\n64a \n \noperating any such office. ATCA \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. at 3184. The \nATCA took effect on October 3, 2018. \nSeveral days later, on October 8, 2018, the plaintiffs \nfiled a motion to recall the November 2016 mandate issued \nin this action. The plaintiffs argued that the ATCA estab-\nlished personal jurisdiction over the defendants with re-\ngard to the previously dismissed claims. We rejected \nthat contention in Waldman II, reasoning that \u201c[t]he \nplaintiffs ha[d] not shown that either factual predicate . . . \nof the ATCA [was] satisfied.\u201d 925 F.3d at 574. Specifically, \nthe plaintiffs did not dispute that the PLO and the PA \nwere no longer \u201caccept[ing] qualifying assistance\u201d from \nthe United States, and they had failed to show that the de-\nfendants were maintaining any offices \u201cwithin the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States\u201d while \u201cbenefit[ing] from a \nwaiver or suspension\u201d of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202. Id. at 574\u201375. \nFor these reasons, and in light of \u201c[t]his Court\u2019s interest in \nfinality,\u201d we concluded that the circumstances did not \n\u201cwarrant invoking the extraordinary remedy of recalling \na mandate issued two and a half years\u201d earlier. \nId. at 575\u201376. Accordingly, on June 3, 2019, the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate was denied. Id. at 576. \nWhile the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari \nfrom Waldman II was pending, Congress acted again, \nthis time enacting the PSJVTA on December 20, 2019. See \nPub. L. No. 116-94, \u00a7 903(c), 133 Stat. 2534, 3082. A de-\ntailed description of the PSJVTA is set forth in Fuld. \nBriefly, \u00a7 903(c) of the PSJVTA superseded the ATCA \nprovision codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), resulting in a nar-\nrowed definition of the term \u201cdefendant,\u201d which now re-\nfers solely to the PLO, the PA, and any \u201csuccessor[s]\u201d or \n\u201caffiliate[s]\u201d thereof.4 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). The PSJVTA \n \n4 As stated in Fuld, the PSJVTA also includes a number of additional \nprovisions, but we do not pass on the constitutionality of any portion \n\n65a \n \nalso specified new post-enactment conduct that would be \n\u201cdeemed\u201d to constitute \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction \nin civil ATA actions, \u201cregardless of the date of the occur-\nrence of the act of international terrorism upon which such \ncivil action was filed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nThese new factual predicates for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d are \nlisted in two prongs, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). The first prong provides that \u201ca de-\nfendant shall be deemed to have consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d if, after April 18, 2020, the defendant \u201cmakes \nany payment, directly or indirectly\u201d: \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, after \nbeing fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been impris-\noned for committing any act of terrorism that injured \nor killed a national of the United States, if such pay-\nment is made by reason of such imprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, following \nsuch individual\u2019s death while committing an act of ter-\nrorism that injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of the death \nof such individual. \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). Under the second prong, \u201ca defendant \nshall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d \nif, after January 4, 2020, the defendant \u201ccontinues to main-\ntain,\u201d \u201cestablishes,\u201d or \u201cprocures any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in the \nUnited States,\u201d or otherwise \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of the \n[PLO] or the [PA].\u201d Id. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The PSJVTA ex-\nempts \u201ccertain activities and locations\u201d from the reach of \n \nof the PSJVTA other than \u00a7 903(c). For purposes of clarity, this opin-\nion refers to \u00a7 903(c) as the PSJVTA, which is consistent with the opin-\nion in Fuld, as well as with the nomenclature used in the district court\u2019s \ndecisions and the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal. \n\n66a \n \nthis second prong, including, among others, conduct re-\nlated to \u201cofficial business of the United Nations.\u201d5 Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nSeveral months after the PSJVTA\u2019s enactment, the \nSupreme Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, vacated the judgment in Waldman II, and re-\nmanded the case \u201cfor further consideration in light of \nthe [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714. On Septem-\nber 8, 2020, this Court in turn issued an order pursuant \nto United States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir. \n1994), remanding the action to the district court \u201cfor the \nlimited purposes of determining the applicability of the \nPSJVTA to this case, and, if the PSJVTA is determined to \napply, any issues regarding its application to this case in-\ncluding its constitutionality,\u201d Order, No. 15-3135, Doc. No. \n368 (Sept. 8, 2020). We stated that \u201c[a]fter the district \ncourt has concluded its consideration, the case will be re-\nturned to this Court for further proceedings,\u201d and that in \nthe meantime, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the Novem-\nber 2016 mandate would be \u201cheld in abeyance.\u201d Id. \nAfter this limited remand to the district court, the Gov-\nernment intervened in the action to defend the constitu-\ntionality of the PSJVTA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a); Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 5.1(c). Several months later, on March 10, 2022, the \ndistrict court issued a decision related to the questions \n \n5 In particular, and as discussed in Fuld, the PSJVTA includes excep-\ntions for facilities and activities devoted \u201cexclusively [to] the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(A)\u2013(B), specified activities related to engagements with \nUnited States officials or legal representation, id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(C)\u2013(E), \nand any activities \u201cancillary to [those] listed\u201d in these exceptions, id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(F). Congress also provided that the PSJVTA \u201cshall apply \nto any case pending on or after August 30, 2016,\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7 903(d)(2), \n133 Stat. at 3085, just one day before this Court\u2019s decision in Waldman \nI. \n\n67a \n \npresented in our Jacobson remand order. See Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 590 F. Supp. 3d 589 \n(S.D.N.Y.), reconsideration denied, 607 F. Supp. 3d 323 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2022). The district court found that the de-\nfendants had triggered the PSJVTA\u2019s first prong, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), because the \u201c[p]laintiffs ha[d] pre-\nsented sufficient evidence to support the determination \nthat [the] [d]efendants . . . made [qualifying] payments af-\nter April 18, 2020.\u201d6 Id. at 594. Nonetheless, the district \ncourt determined that \u201c[t]he conduct identified in the [first \nprong] is insufficient to support a finding that [the] \n[d]efendants have consented to personal jurisdiction,\u201d \nid. at 596, and accordingly, the statute \u201cviolate[s] [con-\nstitutional] due process,\u201d id. at 597. \nOn March 24, 2022, we reinstated the proceedings con-\ncerning the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate. The \nplaintiffs then moved for reconsideration of the district \ncourt\u2019s March 10, 2022 decision, specifically requesting \nthat the district court make factual findings under the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong and consider its constitutionality. \nWe stayed the proceedings in this Court pending the res-\nolution of that motion. \nThe district court denied the motion for reconsidera-\ntion on June 15, 2022. See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 607 F. Supp. 3d 323, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). It declined \nto resolve the parties\u2019 factual dispute as to whether the \n \n6 Specifically, the district court found that the defendants had made \npayments \u201cto the families of individuals killed while committing acts \nof terrorism . . . [that] harmed U.S. nationals,\u201d thereby triggering 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)(ii). Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d at 594. The dis-\ntrict court did not address whether the defendants had made payments \nto the designees of incarcerated terrorists, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(1)(A)(i), and it also declined to \u201creach the issue of whether the \nfactual predicates in . . . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B),\u201d the PSJVTA\u2019s sec-\nond prong, \u201cha[d] been met.\u201d Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d at 595 n.3. \n\n68a \n \ndefendants\u2019 United States activities were exempt from the \nPSJVTA\u2019s second prong, because \u201c[e]ven accepting [the] \n[p]laintiffs\u2019 argument\u201d that no exception applied, the \n\u201ctypes of conduct\u201d at issue did not evince \u201cany intention on \nthe part of [the] [d]efendants to legally submit to suit in \nthe United States.\u201d7 Id. at 326. In light of that determina-\ntion and its March 10, 2022 decision, the district court con-\ncluded that \u201cthe exercise of [personal] jurisdiction under \neither of the PSJVTA\u2019s two jurisdiction-triggering prongs \nwould violate due process.\u201d Id. at 327\u201328. \nWith the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration re-\nsolved, we lifted the stay on these proceedings concerning \nthe motion to recall the mandate. \nII. DISCUSSION \nOur principal task is to give \u201cfurther consideration\u201d to \nthe motion at issue in Waldman II \u2014 that is, the plaintiffs\u2019 \nOctober 2018 motion to recall this Court\u2019s November 2016 \nmandate \u2014 \u201cin light of the [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. \nat 2714. \n\u201cWe possess an inherent power to recall a mandate, \nsubject to review for \nabuse of discretion.\u201d Taylor v. \nUnited States, 822 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted and alteration adopted). However, \n \n7 To support their argument that the defendants had engaged in non-\nexempt activities \u201cwhile physically present in the United States,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B)(iii), the plaintiffs pointed to the defendants\u2019 \n\u201cprovision of consular services in the United States, their interviews \nwith prominent media and social media activity, and their maintenance \nof an office in New York.\u201d Sokolow, 607 F. Supp. 3d at 325. The de-\nfendants did \u201cnot dispute\u201d that they had engaged in these activities; \ninstead, the defendants argued that all of the conduct in question fell \nwithin the PSJVTA\u2019s exemptions for UN-related conduct. Id. at 325\u2013\n26; see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(A), (F). The district court found that it \nwas unnecessary to resolve this issue, and we need not resolve it on \nappeal. \n\n69a \n \n\u201c[i]n recognition of the need to preserve finality in judicial \nproceedings, . . . we exercise [this] authority sparingly and \nonly in exceptional circumstances.\u201d Id. (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted and alteration adopted); see also Cal-\nderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 550 (1998). In some \ncases, the enactment of a new statute might justify the ex-\nercise of our power to recall a previously issued mandate. \nCf. Sargent v. Columbia Forest Prods., Inc., 75 F.3d 86, \n90 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that a recall may be warranted \nwhere changes in governing law cast serious doubt on a \nprevious judgment). But given today\u2019s decision in Fuld, \nthis case is not one of them. \nThe plaintiffs make a variety of arguments in support \nof their position that \u201c[t]his Court should recall the man-\ndate, apply the PSJVTA in this case, and remand to the \ndistrict court with instructions to reinstate its original \njudgment based on the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Br. at 2. All of \nthose arguments, however, flow from the premise that the \nPSJVTA \u201cestablishes [consent-based] personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d over the PLO and the PA in a manner consistent with \ndue process. Id. at 26. We reach the opposite conclusion \ntoday in Fuld, and we incorporate the entirety of Fuld\u2019s \nanalysis here. Thus, as set forth in Fuld, the PSJVTA\u2019s \nprovision for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction vi-\nolates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nBecause we find in Fuld that the PSJVTA is uncon-\nstitutional, the statute cannot be applied to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO or the PA in this case. Ac-\ncordingly, no basis exists to recall the November 2016 man-\ndate that issued after Waldman I, where we determined \nthat the plaintiffs\u2019 claims had to be \u201cdismiss[ed] . . . for \nwant of personal jurisdiction.\u201d 835 F.3d at 322. In view of \nthis conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the parties\u2019 \n\n70a \n \nvarious disputes that assume the constitutionality of the \nPSJVTA. \nWe reiterate that the terror attacks at issue in this lit-\nigation were \u201cunquestionably horrific.\u201d Id. at 344. But as \nwe stated in Waldman I and reaffirm today in Fuld, \u201cthe \nfederal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case be-\nyond the limits\u201d of the Due Process Clause, \u201cno matter how \nhorrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id. The PSJVTA\u2019s provision for \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction exceeds those \nconstitutional limits, and accordingly, the statute supplies \nno basis for taking the extraordinary step of recalling this \nCourt\u2019s mandate. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the parties \nand their amici. To the extent not specifically addressed \nabove, those arguments are either moot or without merit. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall \nthe November 2016 mandate is DENIED. \n \n\n \n(71a) \nAPPENDIX C \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n \nMARK I. SOKOLOW, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \n-against- \nPALESTINE LIBERATION \nORGANIZATION and \nPALESTINIAN AUTHORITY, \nDefendants. \n \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n \n \nMEMORANDUM \nDECISION AND \nORDER \n \n04 Civ. 397 (GBD) \n \n \n \nGEORGE B. DANIELS, United States District Judge: \nPlaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of this \nCourt\u2019s earlier ruling on the applicability and constitu-\ntionality of the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. \nJ, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 State. 3082, codified at 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334 (the \u201cPSJVTA\u201d). An exercise of jurisdiction \npursuant to the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cU.S. activities\u201d prong 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(l)(B)(iii), would breach the limits pre-\nscribed by the Due Process Clause. The statute is \ntherefore determined to be unconstitutional. Plaintiffs\u2019 \nmotion for reconsideration, (ECF No. 1056), is denied. \nBACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiffs brought this action against Defendants in \n2004, asserting causes of action for international \n \n1 The relevant factual and procedural background is set forth \nin greater detail in this Court\u2019s original determination on the \napplicability and constitutionality of the PSNTA, see Sokolow v. \n\n72a \n \n \nterrorism pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), \ncodified at 18 U.S.C. 2333, and various state law claims. \n(ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved repeatedly to dismiss \nthe complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. (ECF \nNos. 45, 66, 93.) This Court denied their motions, \nreasoning that \u2018the totality of activities in the United \nStates by the PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of gen-\neral personal jurisdiction.\u201d Sokolow v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30 2011), vacated sub nom. Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org. 835 F.3d 317,337 (2d Cir. \n2016). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daim-\nler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the Second Circuit \nvacated this Court\u2019s decision and held that exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction over Defendants violated the Due Pro-\ncess Clause of the Fifth Amendment because neither de-\nfendant was \u201cat home\u201d in the United States, and the ter-\nrorist attacks at issue \u201cwere not sufficiently connected \nto the United States\u201d to support specific personal juris-\ndiction. Waldman, 835 F.3d at 333-34, 337. \nIn response to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWaldman Congress passed a series of statutes ex-\npanding the bases on which a defendant can be deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction,  including, \nas relevant here, the PSJVTA.  Specifically, the \nPSJVTA states that a defendant is deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction by (1) making pay-\nments to the designees of individuals imprisoned or \nkilled as a result of committing any act of terrorism that \ninjured or killed a U.S. citizen (the PS JVTA\u2019s \u201cpay-\nments prong\u201d ), and (2) maintaining any premises in \n \nPalestine Liberation Org., No. 04 CIV. 397 (GBD), 2022 WL \n719261 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2022), and is incorporated by refer-\nence herein. \n\n73a \n \n \nthe United States or conducting any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestinian Authority or the Palestinian Libera-\ntion Organization (the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cU.S. activities \nprong\u201d ). 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2334(e)(l). Following the pas-\nsage of the PSJVTA, the Second Circuit remanded \nthis case to this Court \u201c for the limited purpose of \ndetermining the applicability of the PSJVTA to this \ncase, and if the PSJVTA is determined to apply, any \nissues regarding its application to this case including \nits constitutionality.\u201d (ECF No. 1006, at 3.) On March \n10, 2022, this Court issued a Memorandum Decision \nand Order in which it held that the factual predicate for \napplication of the PSJVTA\u2019s payments prong to this \ncase had been established, and that the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction pursuant to that prong would be un-\nconstitutional. Sokolow, 2022 WL 719261 at *2-6. \nShortly after entry of this Court\u2019s order, Plaintiffs \nmoved for reconsideration, requesting that this Court \nundertake a similar analysis with respect to the \nPSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities prong. (ECF No. 1056.) This \ndecision follows. \nTHE PSJVTA DOES NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY \nPROVIDE FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER \nDEFENDANTS \nPlaintiffs point to three categories of conduct they \ncontend meet the PSJVTA\u2019s test for consent to jurisdic-\ntion based on non-exempt (non-United Nations \n(\u201cU.N.\u201d)) activities in the United States. (ECF No. \n1057, at 20.) Specifically, Plaintiffs rely on Defendants\u2019 \nprovision of consular services in the United States, their \ninterviews with prominent media and social media activ-\nity, and their maintenance of an office in New York. (Id. \nat 20-23, 32.) Defendants do not dispute they have en-\ngaged in these types of activities. Rather Defendants \n\n74a \n \n \nargue that their conduct falls within the PSJVTA\u2019s ex-\nclusions for official U.N. or U.N.-ancillary activities un-\nder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). (ECF No. 1064, at 15-26.) \nDefendants also argue that the factual predicates of \nthe U.S. activities prong of the PSJVTA even if met \nare not sufficient to support an exercise of personal \njurisdiction consistent with the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment. (Id. at 6-12.) This Court agrees \nwith Defendants\u2019 latter argument, and in doing so, joins \ntwo other courts in concluding that an exercise of juris-\ndiction under either of the PSJVTA\u2019s factual predicates \nis unconstitutional. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., No. 20-CV-3374 (JMF) 2022 WL 62088 at *7 \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6 2022); Shatsky v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 18-CV-12355 (MKV) 2022 WL 826409, \nat*5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18 2022).2 \nEven accepting Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defend-\nants\u2019 United States activities fall within the ambit of \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s U.S. activities prong-a finding this \nCourt need not make in order to resolve the instant \nmotion-these types of conduct do not infer any inten-\ntion on the part of Defendants to legally submit to \nsuit in the United States.3 As the Court explained in \nFuld, in promulgating the PSJVTA, Congress \n\u2018simply took conduct in which the PLO and PA had \npreviously engaged\u2014conduct that the Second and \n \n2 Plaintiffs\u2019  claim that \u201c[n]o court has addressed\u201d the U.S. ac-\ntivities prong of the PSJVTA, (ECF No. 1057, at 13), is incor-\nrect. Both the Fuld and Shatsky Courts specifically considered \nthe U.S. activities prong and ultimately held it unconstitutional. \n3 Both this Court in its March 10, 2022 decision and the Fuld \nCourt discuss the history of the jurisprudence on jurisdiction by \nconsent. Sokolow 2022 WL 719261, at *2-6; Fuld, 2022 WL 62088 \nat *6. This Court will not belabor the discussion by repeating that \nhistory here. \n\n75a \n \n \nD.C. Circuits had held was insufficient to support per-\nsonal jurisdiction in Waldman I and Shatsky I\u2014and de-\nclared that such conduct shall be deemed to be consent.\u201d \nFuld, 2022 WL 62088, at *7. But Congress \u201ccannot \nsimply declare anything it wants to be consent.\u201d Id. at \n*12. Consent is not \u201ca legal fiction devoid of content\u201d and \nneither the courts nor Congress may \u201cengag[e] in circular \nreasoning that premises consent on the presumption that \ndefendants know the law and then define[] the law so \nthat anyone engaging in the defined conduct is deemed \nto have consented to personal jurisdiction.\u201d M3 USA \nCorp. v. Qamoum, No. CV 20-2903 (RDM), 2021 \nWL 2324753, at *12 (D.D.C. June 7, 2021). Consti-\ntutional due process \u201crequires more than notice and the \nopportunity to conform ones conduct for effective con-\nsent to jurisdiction.\u201d Shatsky, 2022 WL 826409 at *5. \nThe activities at issue here\u2014primarily the notarization \nof documents and a handful of interactions with the me-\ndia\u2014are insufficient to support any meaningful consent \nto jurisdiction by Defendants.4 \nThe alternate personal jurisdiction theories Plain-\ntiffs advance do not support their constitutional \n \n4 Plaintiffs rely on Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, \n641 (2d Cir. 2016), for their claim that \u201cthe Second Circuit has \nacknowledged the continued vitality of cases holding that \u2018a defend-\nant may consent to personal jurisdiction without regard to what a \ndue process analysis of its contacts would yield.\u2019\u201d (ECF No. 1057, \nat 15 (quoting Brown).) Brown acknowledged no such theory. To \nthe contrary, the Brown Court only noted that other Circuits have \nso held, and then went on to reject that interpretation: \u201cBut as the \nSupreme Court recognized ... the reach of that coercive power, \neven when exercised pursuant to a corporation\u2019s purported \u2018 con-\nsent,\u2019 may be limited by the Due Process clause.\u201d Brown, 814 F.3d \nat 641. \n\n76a \n \n \nargument.5 As Defendants correctly note Burnham\u2019s \ntag jurisdiction theory only applies to individuals.6 See \ne.g., Estate of Ungar v. Palestinian Auth. \n400 \nF.Supp.2d 541 553 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), aff\u2019d, 332 P. App\u2019x \n643 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing Burnham, 495 U.S. 604); Mar-\ntinez v. Aero Caribbean, 764 F.3d 1062, 1064 (9th Cir. \n2014). Plaintiffs\u2019 secondary suggestion, that Defendants \nconsented to jurisdiction solely by virtue of the fact that \nCongress permits their presence in the United States, re-\nlies heavily on pre-International Shoe case law from the \nnineteenth century that is now obsolete, and in any event, \nrequired some transaction of business in the forum that \nis absent here. See e.g., Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. \nv. Harris, 79 U.S. 65, 81 (1870) (\u201cif it does business there, \nit will be presumed to have assented\u201d); Hess v. Pawloski,  \n274 U.S. 352 355 (1927) (\u201ctransaction of business in state\u201d \nsupports \u201cconsent to be bound by the process of its \ncourts\u201d); Washington v. Superior Ct. of Wash. 289 U.S. \n \n5 This Court notes that Plaintiffs could have raised these theories \nwhich rely on personal jurisdiction case law long predating the in-\nitiation of this suit, in their responses to any of Defendants\u2019 several \nmotions  to dismiss. Motions for reconsideration are not to reiter-\nate previous arguments or raise new arguments that could have \nbeen raised earlier. See e.g., Wil!iams v. Romarm, 751 F. App\u2019x 20, \n24 (2d Cir. 2018). This Court further notes that several of these \ntheories have already been foreclosed by the Second Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in Waldman. Waldman, 835 F.3d at 337. \n6 \u201cTag jurisdiction\u201d refers to a court\u2019s exercise of personal juris-\ndiction over an individual who is served and thus \u201ctagged\u201d while \nphysically present in the forum. In re Edelman, 295 F.3d 171,  179 \n(2d Cir. 2002) (citing Burnham v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 495 U.S. 604 \n(1990) (plurality opinion)); see also Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, \n247 (2d Cir. 1995) (\u201cFed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2) specifically authorizes \npersonal service of a summons and complaint upon an individual \nphysically present within a judicial district of the United States, and \nsuch personal service comports with the requirements of due process \nfor the assertion of personal jurisdiction.\u201d ). \n\n77a \n \n \n361, 364-65 (1933) (state \u201cneed not have admitted the cor-\nporation to do business within its borders\u201d). Finally,  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 argument that Defendants have consented to \njurisdiction in the United States because they \u201creceive \nsubstantial benefits\u201d from their U.S. activities is mis-\nplaced, because a defendant\u2019s receipt of benefits is rele-\nvant to the issue of specific jurisdiction,  not jurisdiction \nby consent. C.f. Fuld, 2022 WL 62088, at *12, n. 10 (\u201crec-\niprocity\u201d or receipt of benefits is not a component of the \nconsent analysis) (collecting cases); see also, Hess, 274 \nU.S. at 356 (\u201cthe implied consent is limited to proceed-\nings growing out of accidents or collisions on a highway \nin which the nonresident may be involved.\u201d). Even if De-\nfendants reap benefits from their activities in the \nUnited States, jurisdiction is still lacking because, as \nthe Second Circuit has already held, the conduct about \nwhich Plaintiffs complain in this suit did not involve \n(and, in fact long predates) the PSJVTA\u2019s in-territory \nactivities in which Defendants now engage. Waldman, \n835 F.3d at 344 (jurisdiction does not exist in this case \nbecause the terror attacks at issue were not expressly \naimed at the United States, death and injuries suffered \nby U.S. nationals were random, and lobbying activities \nregarding American policy toward Israel are insuffi-\nciently suit-related). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above and in this Court\u2019s \nMarch 10, 2022 decision, Sokolow, 2022 WL 719261, at \n*2-6,  the exercise of jurisdiction under either of the \nPSJVTA\u2019s two jurisdiction\u00adtriggering prongs would vi-\nolate due process. The statute is therefore unconstitu-\ntional. \n\n78a \n \n \nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to close the open \nmotions at ECF Nos. 1056 and 1068.7 \nDated:  June 15, 2022 \n \nNew York, New York \nSO ORDERED. \n George B.

DANIELS, United States District Judge: \nThis action returns to this Court on remand from the \nSecond Circuit for the \u201climited purposes of determining \nthe applicability of the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. \nJ, tit. IX,\u00a7 903, 133 State. 3082 (the \u201cPSJVTA\u201d)\u201d and \u201cany \nissues regarding its application to this case including its \nconstitutionality.\u201d (Mandate of the U.S.C.A., ECF No. \n1006, at 3.) \nFollowing remand, the parties, submitted briefing con-\ncerning: (1) whether the factual predicates for application \nof the PSJVTA have been met; and (2) whether application \nof the statute is unconstitutional. On May 19, 2021, this \nCourt heard argument from the parties. After oral argu-\nment, the parties filed supplementing briefing. (Defend-\nants\u2019 Letter dated June 9, 2021, ECF No. 1031; Plaintiffs \nLetter dated July 6, 2021, ECF No. 1035.) On September \n7, 2021, the Government intervened in this action and filed \n\n80a \n \n \na memorandum of law in support of the constitutionality \nof the PSNTA. (Government\u2019s Brief in Support of \nPSJVTA, ECF No. 1043). Defendant responded to the \nGovernment\u2019s brief. (Defendants\u2019 Letter dated Septem-\nber 20, 2021, ECF No. 146.) Having considered the par-\nties\u2019 arguments, the Court finds (I) that the factual predi-\ncate for application of the PSJVTA to this case has been \nestablished, and (2) that the statute is unconstitutional. \nI.  BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiffs brought this action against Defendants in \n2004, asserting causes of action for international terrorism \npursuant to the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), codified in \n18 U.S.C. 2333, and various state law claims. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal juris-\ndiction in July 2007. (Notice of Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, \nECF No. 45.) In a memorandum decision and order dated \nSeptember 30, 2008, Defendants\u2019 motion was denied with-\nout prejudice; Plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion for jurisdictional \ndiscovery was granted. (ECF No. 58.) Defendants re-\nnewed their motion to dismiss the Complaint on May 29, \n2009. (Notice of Renewed Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, \nECF No. 66.) In a memorandum decision and order dated \nMarch 11, 2010, this Court denied Defendants\u2019 motion \nwithout prejudice to renew at the close of jurisdictional \ndiscovery. (ECF No. 79.) Following the close of jurisdic-\ntional discovery in April 2010, Defendants renewed their \nmotion. (Notice of Mot. to Dismiss Complaint, ECF No. \n81.) In a memorandum decision and order dated March \n30, 2011, Defendants\u2019 motion was denied. (ECF No. 87.) \nDefendant next moved to transfer venue to the District of \nColumbia or, in the alternative, to dismiss the case for lack \nof personal jurisdiction. (Notice of Mot. to Transfer \n \n1 The Court references only the underlying facts and procedural his-\ntory necessary to explain the Court\u2019s decision. \n\n81a \n \n \nVenue, ECF No. 93.) That motion was denied in an Order \ndated June 2, 2011. (ECF No. 122.) \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daimler \nAG v. Bauman, Defendants moved for reconsideration of \nthis Court\u2019s March 2011 Memorandum Decision and Or-\nder. (Notice of Mot. for Reconsideration, ECF No. 421.) \nDefendants\u2019 motion was denied in an Order dated June \n16, 2014. (ECF No. 537.) Defendants moved for summary \njudgment, arguing that Daimler required dismissal for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. (Notice of Mot. for Summary \nJudgment, ECF 496.) Defendants\u2019 motion for summary \njudgment was denied. (Memorandum Decision and Order \ndated December 1, 2014, ECF No. 657.) Defendants peti-\ntioned the Second Circuit for expedited review of the deci-\nsion and for a stay of all district court proceedings pending \nreview, including of the trial scheduled for January l, \n2015. (Notice of Motion for Stay of Proceedings, ECF \nNo. 665.) Defendants\u2019 petition and motion were denied. \n(Mandate dated January 28, 2015, ECF No., 777.) Follow-\ning a seven-week trial, a jury returned a verdict for Plain-\ntiffs. (Judgment, ECF No. 980.) Defendants appealed the \nverdict. On appeal, the Second Circuit found that Defend-\nants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the fo-\nrum to allow the Court to exercise general or specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction over them. Waldman v. Palestine Liber-\nation Org., 835 F.3d 317,323 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded \nthe case with instructions to dismiss the action for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction \u201cover defendants with respect to the \nclaims in this action.\u201d (Id at 4.) \nIn reaction to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Wald-\nman, Congress passed the Anti\u2022 Terrorism Clarification \nAct (\u201cATCA\u201d). Pub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018). \nThe ATCA amended the ATA, providing that a defendant \n\n82a \n \n \nis deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in a \ncivil action under the ATA (1) by accepting US foreign as-\nsistance, or (2) by benefitting from a waiver or suspension \nof 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205.2 After the passage of the law, Plaintiffs \npetitioned the Second Circuit to recall its mandate in light \nof the ATCA The Second Circuit denied the petition, find-\ning that the factual predicates of the ATCA had not been \nsatisfied because, at the time of the appeal, Defendants \nwere not accepting U.S. foreign assistance, they were not \nbenefitting from a waiver or suspension of Section 1003 of \nthe ATA, nor were Defendants maintaining an office or fa-\ncility within the jurisdiction of the United States. Wald-\nman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 925 F.3d 570, 573 (2d \nCir. 2019) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d). Plaintiffs appealed Waldman \nII to the Supreme Court. While the appeal was pending, \nCongress passed the PSJVTA, expanding the bases on \nwhich a defendant can consent to personal jurisdiction. \nSpecifically, the statute states that a defendant may con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction in cases under the ATA by (1) \nmaking payments to the designees of individuals impris-\noned or killed as a result of committing any act of terror-\nism that injured or killed a U.S. citizen, and (2) maintaining \nany premises in the United States or conducting any activ-\nity while physically present in the United States on behalf \nof the Palestinian Authority or the Palestinian Liberation \nOrganization. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2334(e)(l). Following the pas-\nsage of the PSJVTA, the Supreme Court vacated and re-\nmanded the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Waldman II for \nfurther consideration in light of the PSJVTA. Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714, 206 L. Ed. 2d \n852 (2020). \n \n2 Section 5202 forbids the PLO and its successors and agents from \nexpending funds or maintaining facilities within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States. \n\n83a \n \n \nII.  THE PSJVTA APPLIES TO THE CASE \nThe PSJVTA creates personal jurisdiction over de-\nfendants on the basis of deemed consent where a defendant \nmakes payments that trigger the application of the statute, \nor where a defendant engages in certain activities in the \nUnited States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \nPlaintiffs argue that the PSJVTA is applicable to this \ncase under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) because \nDefendants have made payments after April 18, 2020 to \nindividuals convicted for, or killed while, committing acts of \nterrorism that harmed U.S. nationals. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Memo-\nrandum of Law (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Brief\u2019), ECF No. 1018, at 8.) \nPlaintiffs also argue that the statute applies under 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(B)(i) and (ii) because Defendants maintained \nan office in New York City, provided counselor services, \nheld press conferences, and updated social media ac-\ncounts for \u201cthe State of Palestine\u201d after January 4, \n2020. (Id. at 17-18.) \nIn their opposition, Defendants argue that the office \nin New York City is not \u201cin\u201d the United States for the \npurpose of the statute because it is part of the Palestin-\nian Liberation Organization\u2019s (\u201cPLO\u201d) Mission to the \nUnited Nations (\u201cU.N.\u201d) headquartered in New York. \n(Defendants Memorandum of Law (\u201cDefendants\u2019 Oppo-\nsition\u201d), ECF No. 1021, at 11.) In support, Defendants \npoint to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(B). (Id) Defendants also \nargue that their U.S. activities may not be considered \nfor the purpose of determining applicability of the \nPSJVTA because their activities have been undertaken \nexclusively for the purpose of conducting official busi-\nness of the U.N. or, alternatively, fall under exemptions \nto the application of the statute in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3) \nbecause their activities are part of official UN business. \n(Id at 13.) With regards to the payment prong of the \n\n84a \n \n \nstatute, Defendants do not contest that they made pay-\nments triggering application of the PSJVTA under 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(A). (Defendants\u2019 Opposition at 2.) Instead, \nDefendants argue that terrorism convictions that were \nobtained in Israeli military trials were not \u201cfairly tried,\u201d \nas required for application of the statute based on 18 \n\u00a7 2334(e)(l)(A)(i). (Id.) \nThe PSJVTA is codified at 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l). The \nstatute states that \u201cfor the purposes of any civil action \nunder Section 2333 of this title, a defendant shall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in \nsuch civil action if, regardless of the date of the occur-\nrence of the act of international terrorism upon which \nsuch civil action was filled,\u201d defendant engages in cer-\ntain conduct. Id. The statute has two factual predicates \nwhich, if established, triggers applicability. Under the \nfirst factual predicate, the statute will apply where a de-\nfendant, \n[A]fter the date that is 120 days after the date of \nenactment of the [PSJVTA], makes any payment \ndirectly or indirectly -- (i) to any payee desig-\nnated by any individual who, after being fairly \ntried or pleading guilty, has been imprisoned \nfor committing any act of terrorism that injured \nor killed a national of the United States, if such pay-\nment is made by reason of such imprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, follow-\ning such individual\u2019s death while committing an act \nof terrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason of \nthe death of such individual [.] \n18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A). The second factual predicate \nstates that the statute will apply where a defendant, \n\n85a \n \n \n[A]fter 15 days after the date of enactment of the \n[PSJVTA] -- (i) continues to maintain any office, \nheadquarters, premises, or other facilities or estab-\nlishments in the United States; (ii) establishes or \nprocures any office, headquarters, premises, or \nother facilities or establishments in the United \nStates; or (iii) conducts any activity while physically \npresent in the United States on behalf of the Pales-\ntine Liberation Organization or the Palestinian Au-\nthority. \n18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A). \nPlaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to support \nthe determination that Defendants have made payments \nafter April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals killed \nwhile committing acts of terrorism, and that those pay-\nments were made because the individual engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals. \nDefendants have a practice of making payments to the \nfamilies of individuals who died while committing acts of \nterrorism. The Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d) has adminis-\ntered monthly payments to the families of individuals who \ndied while committing acts of terrorism since at least 1994. \n(Declaration of Arieh Spitzen (\u201cSpitzen Declaration\u201d), \nECF No. 1020, at \u00b6 8, 10.) Defendants have control over \nthe payment program and are responsible for its opera-\ntion. (Id. at \u00b6 28.) These payments, known as \u201cshahids,\u201d \nare administered by the Institution for Families of Mar-\ntyrs and the Injured (the \u201cInstitution\u201d). (Id. at \u00b6 12.) Pay-\nment of shahids is made pursuant to a \u201cSocial Examina-\ntion\u201d form submitted by the families of the deceased ter-\nrorists and reviewed by the Institution\u2019s staff. (Id. at \u00b6 13.) \nDefendants have continued making payments to the \nfamilies of individuals killed while committing acts of ter-\nrorism after April 18, 2020. On June 8, 2020, the Prime \n\n86a \n \n \nMinister of Palestine stated \u201cwe continued to pay the pris-\noner and the families of the martyrs in full.\u201d (Middle East \nResearch Institute Special Dispatch dated June 11, 2020, \nECF No. 1020-7, at 1.) Additionally, reports from the \nState Department confirm that Defendants have contin-\nued making shahid payments since October 2020. (Article \ndated October 30, 2020, ECF No 1018-28, at 1.) \nDefendants have made shahid payments to the families \nof individuals killed while committing acts of terrorism be-\ncause of the death of the individual or \u201cmartyrdom.\u201d The \nfamilies of individuals who died in terror attacks would not \nbe eligible for shahid payments from the Institution ab-\nsent the individual\u2019s death. (Id. at 12.) To receive shahid \npayments, the family of deceased terrorists must submit a \nSocial Examination form with information about the de-\nceased, the date, place, and circumstances of their death, \nand proof of their death. (Id. at \u00b6 13.) In one such applica-\ntion, which was approved, the Institution staff wrote in a \nsection titled \u201cDepartment Recommendations\u201d that the \ndeceased \u201cwas martyred during a heroic martyrdom oper-\nation against the Zionists in the occupied city of Jerusa-\nlem\u201d and \u201c[t]herefore, we recommend that she is consid-\nered one of the al-Awsa Intifada martyrs according to the \nregulations.\u201d (Id. at 5.) \nDefendants have made shahid payments on behalf of \nindividuals who died during an act of terrorism that \nharmed injured U.S. nationals. For example, Wafa Idris \ndied on January 27, 2020 while committing an act of terror-\nism. (Spitzen Declaration \u00b6 45; Declaration of Kent A. \nYalowitz (\u201cYalowitz Declaration\u201d), ECF No. 1018, at \u00b6 78.) \nThe attack injured five U.S. nationals: Mark Sokolow, \nElana Sokolow, Jamie Sokolow, Lauren Sokolow, and \nRena Sokolow. (Yalowitz Declaration at \u00b6 77.) An appli-\ncation for shahid was filed by Idris\u2019 mother with the \n\n87a \n \n \nInstitution for Families of Martyrs and the Injured. \n(Wafa Idris Social Examination, ECF No. 1020-13, at 1.) \nThe application was approved. (Id. at 5.) A shahid pay-\nment of 600 shekels a month was allocated. (Id.) \nAs Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to show that \nDefendants conduct meets the factual predicate in 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a72334(e)(l)(A)(ii) has been met, the PSJVTA is ap-\nplicable to this case.3 \nIII. THE PSJVTA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL \nThe PSJVTA states that Defendants are \u201cdeemed to \nconsent to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they meet any of the \nfactual predicates identified in 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(l)(A) or \n(B). \nDefendant argues that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the \nPSJVTA violates the due process clause of the Constitu-\ntion because it does not reflect a free and voluntary relin-\nquishment of Defendants\u2019 right to personal jurisdiction. \n(Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Brief on the PSJVTA in Fuld \net al. v. PLO et al., 20 Civ 3374, ECF No. 42, at 5.) Defend-\nants contend that for the conduct identified in the PSJVTA \nto reflect an agreement to consent to the forum\u2019s exercise \nof personal jurisdiction over it, Defendants must receive a \nreciprocal benefit in exchange. (Id. at 6-7.) Since the stat-\nute does not confer any benefit on Defendants, Defendants \nargue that the PSJVTA represents an unconstitutional \nimposition of personal jurisdiction. (Id. at 7.) \nIn opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the PSJVTA\u2019s \ndeemed consent provision establishes constitutionally \nvalid personal jurisdiction over Defendants on the basis of \n \n3 Having determined that the PSJVTA applies under 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A)(ii), this Court does not reach the issue of whether the \nfactual predicates in 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A)(ii) or 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(l)(B) have been met. \n\n88a \n \n \nimplied consent. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defs.\u2019 Supp. \nBrief (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Response\u201d), ECF No. 1035, at 4.) Plain-\ntiffs argue that the doctrine of implied consent does not \nrequire that Defendants receive a reciprocal benefit for \nthe Court\u2019s exercise of judicial power to be constitu-\ntional.  (Id. at 6.) Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants\u2019 \ndecision to engage in conduct identified by the statute was \nknowing and voluntary. (Id.) Plaintiffs contend that De-\nfendants\u2019 decision to engage in the conduct that triggered \nthe application of the PSJVTA amounts to a legal submis-\nsion that Defendants have impliedly consented to personal \njurisdiction. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Response at 4.) \nUnder the due process clause of the Constitution, \ncourts may not exercise judicial power over a defendant \nwhere maintenance of the suit offends traditional notions \nof fair play and substantial justice. Daimler AG v. Bau-\nman, 571 U.S. 117, 126 (2014). The requirement that courts \nhave personal jurisdiction over defendants represents a \nrestriction on judicial power as a matter of individual lib-\nerty. Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704 (1982). As an individual right, \npersonal jurisdiction can be waived by a defendant. (Id.) \nA court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant \ncomports with due process where defendant has sufficient \ncontacts with the forum to support general or specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Daimler, 571 U.S. at 126. A court may \nalso exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, even \nabsent minimum contacts, where the defendant consents \nto the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. Ins. Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 704. \nThe conduct identified in the PSJVTA is insufficient to \nsupport a finding that Defendants have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction. A defendant may consent to a court\u2019s \njurisdiction expressly or by implication. Id. at 703-4. \n\n89a \n \n \nCourts have found that a defendant constructively con-\nsents to a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction where defendants \nrefuses to comply with discovery orders regarding per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Hammond Packing Co. v. State of Ark., \n212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909). Specifically, where a defendant \nviolates court orders requiring them to produce evidence \nmaterial to the issue of personal jurisdiction, courts have \ntaken that conduct as a legal submission to support a pre-\nsumption of the fact that \u201cthe refusal to produce evi-\ndence material to the administration of due process was \nbut an admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d Id. The Hammond Court found that this pre-\nsumption was like \u201cmany other presumptions attached \nby law to the failure of a party to a cause to specially set \nup or assert his supposed rights in the mode prescribed \nby law.\u201d Id. The presumption did not violate due pro-\ncess because it was based on the \u201cundoubted right of the \nlawmaking power to create a presumption of fact as to \nthe bad faith and untruth of an answer to be gotten from \nthe suppression or failure to produce the proof ordered, \nwhen such proof concerned the rightful decision of the \ncause.\u201d Id. \nHere, the parties do not dispute that Defendants\u2019 \nconduct m making payments to individuals killed while \ncommitting acts of terrorism that killed U.S. Nationals \ntriggers application of the PSJVTA. (Supra at II.) This \nconduct is wholly unrelated to any court order in this lit-\nigation. Jurisdictional discovery took place in this case \nin 2008. Defendants did not violate any discovery or-\nders. Accordingly, Defendants actions in violation of \nthe statute is insufficiently related to the litigation to \nenable the court to exercise constitutionally valid \n\n90a \n \n \npersonal jurisdiction over Defendants on the basis of \nconstructive or implied consent.4 \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants\u2019 decision to make \npayments that trigger the application of the PSNTA \nrepresents a legal submission to this Court that Defend-\nants have impliedly consented to personal jurisdiction. \n(Plaintiffs\u2019 Response at 4.) In support of its argument, \nPlaintiffs cite Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des \nBauxites de Guinee. In Ins. Corp. of Ireland, the trial \ncourt sanctioned the defendant for violating discovery or-\nders under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure by taking as established the fact that the de-\nfendant in that case had sufficient contacts with the forum \nto support personal jurisdiction, which is what plaintiff \nwas trying to prove through discovery. Ins. Corp of Ire-\nland, 456 U.S. at 705-7. Affirming the trial court, the Su-\npreme Court found that the sanction did not violate due \nprocess because the facts of the case supported a Ham-\nmond Packing presumption, and \u201cthe sanction was spe-\ncifically related to the particular \u2018claim\u2019 at issue in the or-\nder to provide discovery.\u201d (Id at 706.)

Jan. 6, 2022) (finding the \nPSJVTA did not constitutionally provide for personal jurisdiction \nover the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Au-\nthority on the basis of implied consent because \u201cthe conduct to \nwhich Congress attached jurisdictional consequence in the \nPSJVTA is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the fiction\u2019 that \n[d)efendants actually consented to the jurisdiction of the Court\u201d \nand inferring consent from \u2018martyr payments\u2019 \u201cthat have no direct \nconnection to the United States, let alone litigation in a United \nStates court - would strain the idea of consent beyond its breaking \npoint\u201d). \n\n91a \n \n \nHammond Packing presumption.5 The conduct at issue is \nunrelated to the underlying issues in the litigation, nor \nwould the sanction of finding personal jurisdiction be spe-\ncifically related to any court order. Contra Ins. Corp of \nIreland, 456 U.S. at 703-4 (no due process violation where \npersonal jurisdiction is based on a presumption of fact re-\nsulting from defendant\u2019s refusal to comply with discovery \norders). Accordingly, finding that Defendants have im-\npliedly consented to personal jurisdiction based solely on \ntheir conduct in violation of the PSJVTA would violate the \ndue process clause of the constitution.6 \n \n5 Nor could this Court make such a finding, as the Second Circuit \nalready held, that there were insufficient contacts to support general \nor specific jurisdiction in this case. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 344 (find-\ning that general jurisdiction did not exist over defendants because \nthey were not at home in New York; specific jurisdiction did not exist \nbecause the terror attacks at issue were not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States, deaths and injuries suffered by U.S. nationals were \nrandom, and lobbying activities regarding American policy toward \nIsrael are insufficiently suit-related). \n6 In addition to its support for Plaintiffs arguments, in its memo-\nrandum of law in intervention, the Government contends that fed-\neral courts must accord deference to the PSJVTA because the stat-\nute represents an enactment by Congress and the President in the \nfield of foreign affairs. (Govt. Mem ISO PSNTA at 13.) The Gov-\nernment cites Bank Marzai v. Peterson in support. In that case, \nthe Supreme Court noted that \u201c[i]n pursuit of foreign policy objec-\ntives, the political branches have regulated specific foreign-state \nassets by, inter alia, blocking them or governing their availability \nfor attachment ... Such measures have never been rejected as in-\nvasions of the Article HI judicial power.\u201d Bank Markazi v. Peter-\nson, 578 U.S. 212, 235(2016). As this Court finds that the PSNTA is \nunconstitutional for its violation of the due process clause, not for \nits invasion of the separation of powers, the Government\u2019s argu-\nment is inapplicable. \n\n92a \n \n \nIV.

FURMAN, United States District Judge: \nThe Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments have long been interpreted to mean that a \nparty cannot be subjected to the jurisdiction of a forum\u2019s \ncourts unless the party has certain minimum contacts with \nthe forum. Courts have recognized three independent ba-\nses for such \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d: first, general jurisdic-\ntion, when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with the forum in \nwhich suit is brought are so constant and pervasive as to \nrender it essentially at home in the forum; second, specific \njurisdiction, when there is a sufficient connection between \nthe underlying controversy and the forum; and third, a de-\nfendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent, whether ex-\npress or implied, to suit in the forum. \nTo date, courts have held that these bases are insuffi-\ncient to sustain lawsuits brought by family members of \nAmerican victims of terrorist attacks in Israel and the oc-\ncupied territories under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 \n(\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 et seq., against the Palestine \n\n94a \n \n \nLiberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian Au-\nthority (\u201cPA\u201d). In 2019, Congress responded to these rul-\nings by enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \ndiv. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, which includes innova-\ntive provisions intended to ensure that such lawsuits are \nnot dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction. Specifi-\ncally, the statute provides that the PLO and PA would be \n\u201cdeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in any \ncase brought under the ATA if, after a date certain, they \nengaged in specified conduct \u2014 conduct in which they had \nlong engaged. \nThe novel question presented in this case \u2014 brought \nby the family members of a Jewish American killed in a \n2018 terrorist attack in Gush Etzion, a settlement located \nin the West Bank, against the PLO and the PA for their \nalleged roles in encouraging and supporting the attack \u2014 \nis whether this \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction is consistent \nwith the requirements of due process. For the reasons that \nfollow, the Court concludes that it is not. In brief, Con-\ngress cannot, consistent with the Constitution, simply de-\ncree that any conduct, without regard for its connections \nto the United States generally or to litigation in the United \nStates specifically, signals a party\u2019s intent to submit to the \njurisdiction of a United States court. To hold otherwise \nwould effectively mean that there are no constitutional \nlimitations on the exercise of personal jurisdiction as a leg-\nislature could simply create such jurisdiction out of whole \ncloth by deeming any conduct \u2014 even, for example, the \nconduct that gives rise to the cause of action itself \u2014 to be \n\u201cconsent.\u201d The Court cannot and will not acquiesce in \nwhat amounts to a legislative sleight of hand at the ex-\npense of a fundamental constitutional right and, thus, is \ncompelled to grant the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s motion to dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. \n\n95a \n \n \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs in this case are the wife and four children of \nAri Yoel Fuld, an American citizen who, on September 16, \n2018, was brutally stabbed to death outside a mall in Gush \nEtzion, a settlement located in the West Bank. See ECF \nNo. 21 (\u201cAm. Compl.\u201d), \u00b6\u00b6 106-110. Plaintiffs allege, on in-\nformation and belief, that Khalil Yousef Ali Jabarin, the \nmurderer, targeted Fuld because he was a Jewish Ameri-\ncan. See id. \u00b6 107; see also id. \u00b6 101 (alleging, on infor-\nmation and belief, that Jabarin \u201cdecided to become . . . a \n\u2018martyr[]\u2019 and kill Jews\u201d). In this suit, however, they do \nnot seek relief from Jabarin (who was apprehended by Is-\nraeli authorities after the murder). Instead, they seek \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the PA, \nwhich was established by the 1993 Oslo Accords to exer-\ncise interim governance authority for the Palestinian peo-\nple in Gaza and the West Bank, and the PLO, which has \nbeen recognized by the United Nations as the representa-\ntive of the Palestinian people, on the ground that they \u201cen-\ncouraged, incentivized, and assisted\u201d the attack on Fuld. \nId. \u00b6 4. They do so principally pursuant to the ATA, as \namended by the PSJVTA. See id. \u00b6 1. \nCongress enacted the ATA in 1992 in an effort \u201cto de-\nvelop a comprehensive legal response to international ter-\nrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 102-1040, at 5 (1992) (\u201c1992 House \nReport\u201d); see Pub. L. No. 102-572, \u00a7 1003(a), 106 Stat. \n4506, 4521-24 (1992) (adding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2331, 2333-2338). \nThe statute created a civil damages remedy for United \nStates nationals harmed by an act of international terror-\nism committed by a foreign terrorist organization. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). To the extent relevant here, it permits \nsuch United States nationals to sue \u201cany person who aids \nand abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, \nor who conspires [to commit] an act of international ter-\nrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2). Among other things, it provides \n\n96a \n \n \nfor treble damages plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See id. \n\u00a7 2333(a). \nIn 2004, a group of eleven American families (the \n\u201cSokolow plaintiffs\u201d) sued the PA and PLO under the ATA \nfor various terrorist attacks in Israel. See Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317, 322, 324 (2d Cir. \n2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d). The PA and PLO moved repeatedly \nto dismiss the Sokolow plaintiffs\u2019 claims for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction, but the district court denied their mo-\ntions, reasoning that \u201cthe totality of activities in the United \nStates by the PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of gen-\neral personal jurisdiction.\u201d Sokolow v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2011), vacated sub nom. Waldman I, \n835 F.3d 317. After more than a decade of litigation and a \nseven-week trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the \nSokolow plaintiffs and awarded them more than $650 mil-\nlion pursuant to the ATA\u2019s treble damages provision. See \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 322, 326. \nIn the meantime, in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014), the Supreme Court clarified that \u201cgeneral\u201d \npersonal jurisdiction is appropriate only in a forum where \nthe defendant is \u201cessentially at home,\u201d which, in the case \nof a non-natural person, is usually limited to its place of in-\ncorporation or principal place of business, see id. at 136-\n39. In the wake of Daimler, the Second Circuit vacated \nthe judgment in Sokolow, holding in Waldman I that the \ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over the \nPA and PLO had violated the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment because neither defendant was \u201cat \nhome\u201d in the United States and the terrorist attacks at is-\nsue \u201cwere not sufficiently connected to the United States\u201d \nto support \u201cspecific personal jurisdiction.\u201d 835 F.3d at 337. \nIn a trio of similar cases against the PA and PLO, the D.C. \n\n97a \n \n \nCircuit reached the same conclusions. See Shatsky v. Pal-\nestine Liberation Org., 955 F.3d 1016, 1036-37 (D.C. Cir. \n2020); Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d \n1115, 1123-24 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. granted, judgment va-\ncated, 140 S. Ct. 2713 (2020), and opinion reinstated in \npart, No. 15-7034, 2020 WL 5361653 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 18, \n2020); Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 56-57 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017). \nIn 2018, Congress responded to these decisions by en-\nacting the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184 (adding 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)). Section 4 of the ATCA provided that, \n\u201cfor purposes of any civil action under [the ATA], a defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction in such civil action if,\u201d after January 31, 2019, the \ndefendant \u201caccepts\u201d certain \u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d from \nthe United States or maintains an office within the United \nStates pursuant to a waiver or suspension of 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 5202 (which otherwise prohibits the PLO from maintain-\ning an office in the United States). Id. Within days of the \nATCA\u2019s enactment, the Sokolow plaintiffs filed a motion \nasking the Second Circuit to recall the mandate in Wald-\nman I, arguing that Section 4 of the ATCA provided per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PA and PLO. See Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 925 F.3d 570, 574 (2d Cir. 2019) \n(per curiam) (\u201cWaldman II\u201d), cert. granted, judgment va-\ncated sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 140 \nS. Ct. 2714 (2020). The Second Circuit denied their motion, \nfinding that the plaintiffs had failed to show \u201cthat either \nfactual predicate of Section 4 of the ACTA ha[d] been sat-\nisfied.\u201d Id. Once again, the D.C. Circuit reached the same \nconclusions. See Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1128. \nThe plaintiffs in these cases filed petitions for certio-\nrari in the Supreme Court. On December 20, 2019, while \n\n98a \n \n \ntheir petitions were pending, Congress intervened again \nby passing the PSJVTA. To the extent relevant here, the \nPSJVTA superseded the personal jurisdiction provisions \nin the ATCA. It amended the definition of \u201cdefendant\u201d to \nspecifically include the PA, the PLO, and their affiliates \nand successors. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903(b)(5), 133 Stat. 3082, 3083. And it provided two new \nfactual predicates for conduct that will be \u201cdeemed\u201d con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction for civil actions under the \nATA. As amended by the PSJVTA, the ATA now pro-\nvides, first, that a defendant \u201cshall be deemed to have con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in ATA cases if, after April \n18, 2020, it \u201cmakes any payment, directly or indirectly,\u201d to \neither (i) a payee designated by someone imprisoned for \nan act of terrorism that injured or killed an American na-\ntional \u201cif such payment is made by reason of such impris-\nonment\u201d or (ii) to a family member of an individual who \ndied while committing an act of terrorism that injured or \nkilled an American national \u201cif such payment is made by \nreason of the death of such individual.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A). Second, the Act states that a defendant \nwill be \u201cdeemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d if, after January 4, 2020, it \u201cestablishes,\u201d \u201cprocures,\u201d \nor \u201ccontinues to maintain any office, headquarters, prem-\nises, or other facilities or establishments in the United \nStates,\u201d or \u201cconducts any activity while physically present \nin the United States on behalf of\u201d the PLO or the PA. Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). That subsection is subject to several ex-\nceptions, including, most notably, offices or facilities used \n\u201cexclusively for the purpose of conducting official business \nof the United Nations\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d activities. Id. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nOn April 27, 2020, the Supreme Court granted certio-\nrari to both the Sokolow plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the \nD.C. Circuit litigation, vacated the lower court judgments, \n\n99a \n \n \nand remanded the cases \u201cfor further consideration in light \nof the [PSJVTA].\u201d Sokolow, 140 S. Ct. at 2714; see Klie-\nman, 140 S. Ct. at 2713. Thereafter, the Second Circuit \nremanded Sokolow to the district court \u201cfor the limited \npurpose of determining the applicability of the PSJVTA to \n[that] case, and, if the PSJVTA is determined to apply, any \nissues regarding its application to [that] case including its \nconstitutionality.\u201d Mandate, Waldman v. Palestine Liber-\nation Org., No. 15-3135 (2d Cir. Sept. 8, 2020), ECF No. \n369. On remand, the parties (and the United States) have \nbriefed both issues. See Sokolow v. Palestinian Libera-\ntion Org., No. 04-CV-397 (GBD) (S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2015), \nECF Nos. 1015, 1021, 1022, 1043.1 \nIn the meantime, Plaintiffs filed this suit on April 30, \n2020, three days after the Supreme Court vacated and re-\nmanded in Sokolow. See ECF No. 1. In their Amended \nComplaint, Plaintiffs allege that both prongs of the \nPSJVTA\u2019s personal jurisdiction provisions are satisfied. \nFirst, they allege that, after April 18, 2020, Defendants \nmade payments to the families of deceased terrorists who \nkilled or injured Americans and to the designees of terror-\nists who pleaded guilty or were fairly convicted of killing \nor injuring Americans. See Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-57, 59, 60, \n \n1 The Shatksy and Klieman plaintiffs are also still pursuing their \nclaims in light of the PSJVTA. In conjunction with their litigation in \nthe D.C. Circuit, the Shatsky plaintiffs also filed a \u201cprotective action\u201d \nin this Court. See Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 18-CV-\n12355 (MKV) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2020), ECF No. 21, at 1. In that pro-\nceeding, Defendants have also moved to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction, and their motion remains pending. See Shatsky v. Pales-\ntine Liberation Org., No. 18-CV-12355 (MKV) (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, \n2021), ECF No. 116. Meanwhile, the Klieman plaintiffs are seeking \njurisdictional discovery before the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia. See Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. \n04-CV-1173 (PLF) (D.D.C. Dec. 2, 2020), ECF No. 298. \n\n100a \n \n \n62-67, 114-115.2 Second, they allege that, after January 4, \n2020, Defendants provided consular services in the United \nStates, and conducted press-conferences, distributed in-\nformational materials, and engaged the United States me-\ndia in order to influence American foreign policy and pub-\nlic opinion. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 68-90. They further allege that, after \nJanuary 4, 2020, Defendants maintained offices in the \nUnited States that were not used exclusively for the pur-\npose of conducting official United Nations business. See \nid. \u00b6\u00b6 75-95. \nAfter Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, the PA \nand PLO moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand for failure to state a claim. See ECF No. 24. For rea-\nsons not relevant here, the Court directed the parties to \nfile supplemental briefs as to the \u201capplication and consti-\ntutionality of the PSJVTA.\u201d ECF No. 34. Additionally, af-\nter confirming that the PA and PLO sought to challenge \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA, the Court, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403(a) and Rule 5.1(b) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, certified the constitutional challenge to \nthe Attorney General of the United States and invited him \nto intervene. ECF No. 36. The United States subse-\nquently intervened and filed a brief defending the consti-\ntutionality of the PSJVTA. ECF No. 52; see ECF No. 53 \n(\u201cU.S. Mem.\u201d). Thereafter, both sides submitted supple-\nmental briefs responding to the submission of the United \n \n2 In fact, Plaintiffs allege, albeit not in the Amended Complaint, that \nsuch payments \u201care a legal entitlement under the PA Prisoners and \nEx-Prisoners Law, under which \u2018[t]he PA must give every prisoner a \nmonthly salary . . .

See Am.

By contrast, Defendants \ndo contest Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the PSJVTA\u2019s second \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d prong has been met. See, e.g., Defs.\u2019 Mem. 21-25; ECF No. \n50 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Reply\u201d), at 7-10. Because the Court concludes that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s first prong has been met, it need not decide whether De-\nfendants\u2019 conduct also implicates the second prong. \n\n103a \n \n \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316-17 (1945)). \nMore specifically, there are three traditional bases for per-\nsonal jurisdiction that comport with constitutional due \nprocess principles. First, a court may exercise \u201cgeneral \njurisdiction\u201d over a foreign defendant \u201cwhen the defend-\nant\u2019s affiliations with the State in which suit is brought are \nso constant and pervasive as to render it essentially at \nhome in the forum State.\u201d Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 331 \n(cleaned up). In such cases, jurisdiction encompasses \u201cany \nand all claims against that defendant.\u201d Id. Second, a court \nmay exercise \u201cspecific or conduct-linked jurisdiction\u201d \nwhere there is a sufficient \u201caffiliation between the forum \nand the underlying controversy, principally, activity or an \noccurrence that takes place in the forum state and is there-\nfore subject to the State\u2019s regulation.\u201d Sonera Holding \nB.V. v. Cukurova Holding A.S., 750 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. \n2014) (cleaned up). In other words, \u201cto exercise jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process, the defendant\u2019s suit-re-\nlated conduct must create a substantial connection with \nthe forum.\u201d Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1122 (2014). \nIn this case, Plaintiffs make no argument for general \nor specific jurisdiction, and for good reasons: Any such ar-\ngument would be foreclosed by the Second Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion in Waldman I. First, to the extent relevant here, the \nSecond Circuit held in Waldman I that the neither the PA \nnor the PLO can be fairly regarded as \u201cat home\u201d in the \nUnited States for purposes of general jurisdiction; in-\nstead, both \u201care \u2018at home\u2019 in Palestine, where these enti-\nties are headquartered and from where they are directed.\u201d \nSee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 332-34; see also Shatsky, 955 \nF.3d at 1036 (\u201cThe Palestinian Authority and the PLO are \nnot subject to general jurisdiction because neither one is \n\u2018at home\u2019 in the District of Columbia within the meaning of \nDaimler.\u201d). Second, the Waldman I Court held that the \nalleged tortious actions by the PA and the PLO, \u201cas \n\n104a \n \n \nheinous as they were, were not sufficiently connected to \nthe United States to provide specific personal jurisdiction \nin the United States. There is no basis to conclude that the \ndefendants participated in these acts in the United States \nor that their liability for these acts resulted from their ac-\ntions that did occur in the United States.\u201d 835 F.3d at 337. \nThese conclusions apply, with equal force, to this case.4 It \nfollows that the Court cannot \u201cconstitutionally exercise ei-\nther general or specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants in this case.\u201d Id. at 344. \nInstead of relying on general or specific jurisdiction, \nPlaintiffs here rely entirely on the third traditional basis \nfor personal jurisdiction: consent. See, e.g., J. McIntyre \nMach., Ltd. v. Nicasto, 564 U.S. 873, 880 (2011) (plurality \nopinion); Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n \n4 An argument could be made \u2014 although, conspicuously, Plaintiffs \ndo not make it \u2014 that this case is distinguishable from Waldman I \nbecause here the Amended Complaint alleges, on information and be-\nlief, that the attacker specifically \u201ctargeted\u201d the victim \u201cbecause he \nwas a Jewish American.\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 107; cf. Waldman I, 835 F.3d \nat 343-44 (holding that there was no specific jurisdiction in part \u201cbe-\ncause the terror attacks in Israel at issue . . . were not expressly aimed \nat the United States and because the deaths and injuries suffered by \nthe American plaintiffs in these attacks were random and fortuitous\u201d \n(internal quotation marks omitted)). But the sole factual basis for the \nallegation \u2014 namely, that Jabarin \u201cdeduced\u201d Fuld \u201cwas a Jew and an \nAmerican\u201d on the basis of the latter\u2019s \u201cskullcap\u201d having \u201cbold English \nlettering on it,\u201d Am. Compl. \u00b6 107 \u2014 is too \u201cconclusory and insufficient \nfor specific personal jurisdiction purposes,\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks on \nSept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 659, 676 (2d Cir. 2013); see also Waldman I, \n835 F.3d at 338 (rejecting the argument that \u201cDefendants intended to \nhit American citizens\u201d on that ground that \u201cit would be impermissible \nto speculate based on scant evidence what the terrorists intended to \ndo\u201d (emphasis omitted)). In any event, Plaintiffs have forfeited any \nargument in favor of specific jurisdiction. See, e.g., Delgado v. Vil-\nlanueva, No. 12-CV-3113 (JMF), 2013 WL 3009649, at *2 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y.

Allied Van Lines, \nInc., 900 F.2d 1196, 1199 (8th Cir. 1990).5 Unlike subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, \u201cpersonal jurisdiction represents . . . \nan individual right,\u201d which \u201ccan, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites \nde Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 (1982) (\u201cBauxites\u201d). Thus, \nthe Supreme Court has acknowledged \u201c[a] variety of legal \narrangements\u201d that \u201chave been taken to represent ex-\npress or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the \ncourt.\u201d Id. The archetypal example of express consent \noccurs when \u201cparties to a contract . . . agree in advance to \nsubmit to the jurisdiction of a given court.\u201d Id. at 704 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). Examples of \u201clegal ar-\nrangements\u201d that constitute \u201cimplied\u201d consent are (1) a \nparty\u2019s agreement to arbitrate, see id. (citing Victory \nTransp. Inc. v. Comisaria Gen. de Abastecimientos y \nTransportes, 336 F.2d 354, 363 (2d Cir. 1964) (\u201cBy agree-\ning to arbitrate in New York, where the United States Ar-\nbitration Act makes such agreements specifically enforce-\nable, [the respondent] must be deemed to have consented \nto the jurisdiction of the court that could compel the arbi-\ntration proceeding in New York.\u201d)); and (2) \u201cstate proce-\ndures which find constructive consent to the personal ju-\nrisdiction of the state court in the voluntary use of certain \nstate procedures,\u201d id. (citing Adam v.

See ECF No. 46 (\u201cPls.\u2019 Mem.\u201d), at 13 \nn.4. But they acknowledge that that argument is foreclosed by Wald-\nman I and make it only to preserve the issue \u201cfor appellate consider-\nation.\u201d Id. Thus, the Court need not and does not address the issue \nhere. \n\n106a \n \n \naction against a plaintiff in its courts.\u201d)). Additionally, the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a defendant \nwaives any defense based on lack of personal jurisdiction \n\u2014 and, in that sense, \u201cconsents\u201d to personal jurisdiction \n\u2014 by failing to raise the issue either in an answer or in an \ninitial motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1); see Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 704. \nSignificantly, the reason that consent suffices to sup-\nport personal jurisdiction is rooted in the fact that \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause.\u201d Id. \nat 694. \u201cThe personal jurisdiction requirement recognizes \nand protects an individual liberty interest.\u201d Id. at 702. If \na party consents to appear in a particular forum, whether \nexplicitly or implicitly, it follows that \u201cmaintenance of the \nsuit\u201d in that forum does \u201cnot offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). \u201cThe \nactions of the defendant . . . amount to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Id. at 704-05. After all, \n\u201c[c]onsent, by its very nature, constitutes \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018ac-\nceptance.\u2019\u201d WorldCare Corp. v. World Ins. Co., 767 F. \nSupp. 2d 341, 355 (D. Conn. 2011) (quoting Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary definition of \u201cconsent\u201d as \u201c[a]greement, ap-\nproval, or permission as to some act or purpose, esp. given \nvoluntarily by a competent person; legally effective as-\nsent\u201d). Put differently, like presence in a forum that is suf-\nficient to support general jurisdiction, consent \u201creveals \ncircumstances . . . from which it is proper to infer an inten-\ntion to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the \nlaws of the forum.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 \n(plurality opinion) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Shaffer \nv. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 203-04 (1977) (describing cases in \nwhich the Court \u201cpurported . . . to identify circumstances \nunder which . . . consent [could] be attributed to [a foreign \ndefendant]\u201d as an \u201cattempt[] to ascertain what dealings \n\n107a \n \n \nmake it just to subject a foreign corporation to local suit\u201d \n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nThat inference is reasonable, however, only where the \ndefendant\u2019s statements or conduct actually signal ap-\nproval or acceptance. That, in turn, requires the \u201cconsent\u201d \nto meet certain minimum requirements. Thus, the law \ngenerally requires the party\u2019s consent to be \u201cknowing and \nvoluntary\u201d before it is treated as effective. See, e.g., In re \nAsbestos Prods. Liab. Litig. (No. VI), 384 F. Supp. 3d 532, \n538 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (\u201cIt is axiomatic . . . that consent is only \nvalid if it is given both knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d). After \nall, if a party giving consent does not understand the con-\nsequences of its actions or lacks the ability to withhold con-\nsent, it cannot be said that its \u201cconsent\u201d signals anything, \nlet alone \u201can intention to submit to the laws of the forum.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opinion). Re-\nlatedly, courts may not enforce a party\u2019s express consent \nto personal jurisdiction where doing so \u201cwould be unrea-\nsonable and unjust,\u201d M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., \n407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972), or where the agreement was affected \nby \u201cfraud, undue influence, or overweening bargaining \npower,\u201d id. at 13; see also id. at 10-11 (noting that these \nlimits are \u201cmerely the other side of the proposition . . . that \nin federal courts a party may validly consent to be sued in \na jurisdiction where he cannot be found\u201d). And for conduct \nto imply consent, the conduct must be \u201cof such a nature as \nto justify the fiction\u201d that the party actually consented to \nsubmit itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 \nU.S. at 318. Put simply, for waiver of personal jurisdiction \nthrough consent to satisfy the requirements of due pro-\ncess, it \u201cmust be willful, thoughtful, and fair. \u2018Extorted ac-\ntual consent\u2019 and \u2018equally unwilling implied consent\u2019 are \nnot the stuff of due process.\u201d Leonard v. USA Petroleum \nCorp., 829 F. Supp. 882, 889 (S.D. Tex. 1993). \n\n108a \n \n \nMeasured against these standards, the PSJVTA does \nnot constitutionally provide for personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants in this case. Congress simply took conduct in \nwhich the PLO and PA had previously engaged \u2014 conduct \nthat the Second and D.C. Circuits had held was insufficient \nto support personal jurisdiction in Waldman I, Livnat, \nShatsky, and Klieman \u2014 and declared that such conduct \n\u201cshall be deemed\u201d to be consent. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1); \nsee, e.g., Shatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, 1037 (holding that \nalleged \u201cmartyr payments\u201d did not confer specific jurisdic-\ntion over Defendants). But the conduct to which Congress \nattached jurisdictional consequence in the PSJVTA is not \n\u201cof such a nature as to justify the fiction\u201d that Defendants \nactually consented to the jurisdiction of the Court. Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 318. Inferring consent to jurisdiction in \nthe United States from the first prong of the \u201cdeemed con-\nsent provision\u201d \u2014 for \u201cmartyr payments,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), that have no direct connection to the \nUnited States, let alone to litigation in a United States \ncourt \u2014 would strain the idea of consent beyond its break-\ning point. And while the second prong \u2014 relating to offices \nor other facilities in the United States and activities \u201cwhile \nphysically \npresent \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B) \u2014 does relate to conduct in the United \nStates, the conduct (at least as alleged in this case) is too \nthin to support a meaningful inference of consent to juris-\ndiction in this country. Neither form of conduct, as alleged \nin this case, even remotely signals approval or acceptance \nof the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Nor do they support an infer-\nence that Defendants intended \u201cto submit to the laws of \nthe [United States]\u201d or to the jurisdiction of an American \ncourt. J. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 881 (plurality opin-\nion). It may be that, under different circumstances, Con-\ngress or a state legislature could constitutionally \u201cdeem\u201d \ncertain conduct to be consent to personal jurisdiction. \n\n109a \n \n \n(The Court need not and does not decide that question \nhere.) To pass muster, however, the predicate conduct \nwould have to be a much closer proxy for actual consent \nthan the predicate conduct at issue is here. To be blunt: \nThe PSJVTA is too cute by half to satisfy the require-\nments of due process here. \nThat conclusion finds strong support in College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). The question there \nwas whether a state could be deemed to have waived its \nEleventh Amendment immunity from suit merely by en-\ngaging in conduct that violated federal law. The Supreme \nCourt held that it could not because \u201cthere is little reason \nto assume actual consent based upon the State\u2019s mere \npresence in a field subject to congressional regulation.\u201d \nId. at 680. \u201cThere is a fundamental difference,\u201d the Court \nobserved, \u201cbetween a State\u2019s expressing unequivocally \nthat it waives its immunity and Congress\u2019s expressing un-\nequivocally its intention that if the State takes certain ac-\ntion it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity.\u201d Id. \nat 680-81. In the former situation, the state has voluntarily \nconsented to suit. \u201cIn the latter situation, the most that \ncan be said with certainty is that the State has been put on \nnotice that Congress intends to subject it to suits brought \nby individuals. That is very far from concluding that the \nState made an altogether voluntary decision to waive its \nimmunity.\u201d Id. at 681. The fact that \u201cthe asserted basis \nfor constructive waiver\u201d was \u201cconduct that the State real-\nistically could choose to abandon,\u201d the Court declared, had \n\u201cno bearing on the voluntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. at 684. \nTo be sure, College Savings Bank involved the Elev-\nenth Amendment, not the Due Process Clause of either the \nFifth or Fourteenth Amendments, and there are differ-\nences between the two contexts. Significantly, however, \n\n110a \n \n \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning was not specific to any particular \nconstitutional right. To the contrary, the Court explicitly \nnoted that constructive \u2014 i.e., \u201cdeemed\u201d \u2014 consents were \n\u201csimply unheard of in the context of other constitutionally \nprotected privileges. . . . Constructive consent is not a doc-\ntrine commonly associated with the surrender of consti-\ntutional rights.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (latter emphasis added). \nUnderscoring the point, the Court then offered an exam-\nple involving a very different constitutional right, the Sixth \nAmendment right to trial by jury: \n[I]magine if Congress amended the securities laws \nto provide with unmistakable clarity that anyone \ncommitting fraud in connection with the buying or \nselling of securities in interstate commerce would \nnot be entitled to a jury in any federal criminal \nprosecution of such fraud. Would persons engaging \nin securities fraud after the adoption of such an \namendment be deemed to have \u201cconstructively \nwaived\u201d their constitutionally protected rights to \ntrial by jury in criminal cases? After all, the trading \nof securities is not so vital an activity that any one \nperson\u2019s decision to trade cannot be regarded as a \nvoluntary choice. The answer, of course, is no. The \nclassic description of an effective waiver of a consti-\ntutional right is the intentional relinquishment or \nabandonment of a known right or privilege. Courts \nindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver of fundamental constitutional rights. \nId. at 681-82 (cleaned up). In short, the principles under-\nlying College Savings Bank are not specific to the Elev-\nenth Amendment, but rather apply to constitutional rights \nbroadly. And there is no reason to believe that they apply \nany less forcefully to the constitutional right at issue here \n\u2014 the due process right not to be subjected to suit absent \n\n111a \n \n \nsufficient \u201c\u2018contacts\u2019 with the forum,\u201d Ford Motor Co., 141 \nS. Ct. at 1024 \u2014 than they do to the Sixth Amendment jury \ntrial right. \nThus, College Savings Bank all but compels the con-\nclusion that personal jurisdiction is lacking here. Yes, \nCongress \u201cexpress[ed] unequivocally its intention that if\u201d \neither the PLO or PA \u201ctakes certain action it shall be \ndeemed to have\u201d consented to suit in an American court. \n527 U.S. at 680-81. From that fact, however, \u201cthe most \nthat can be said with certainty is that\u201d the PLO and PA \nhave \u201cbeen put on notice that Congress intends to subject \n[them] to suits\u201d in the United States. Id. at 681. \u201cThat is \nvery far from concluding that\u201d either the PLO or the PA \n\u201cmade an altogether voluntary decision to\u201d submit to such \nsuits. Id. Moreover, the fact that \u201cthe asserted basis for\u201d \ndeemed consent jurisdiction in the PSJVTA is \u201cconduct \nthat\u201d the PLO and PA \u201crealistically could choose to aban-\ndon\u201d is of no moment. Id. at 684. That fact simply has \u201cno \nbearing on the voluntariness of the waiver.\u201d Id. \nThat would be enough, but a pair of recent Second Cir-\ncuit decisions concerning business registration statutes \nprovides additional support for the Court\u2019s conclusion that \nthe exercise of jurisdiction over Defendants here would vi-\nolate due process. See Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., \n814 F.3d 619, 639-41 (2d Cir. 2016); Chen v. Dunkin\u2019 \nBrands, Inc., 954 F.3d 492, 498-99 (2d Cir. 2020). In \nBrown, the Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that by \nregistering to do business in Connecticut and appointing \nan agent for service of process as required by Connecticut \nstatute, the defendant had \u201cconsented to the jurisdiction \nof Connecticut courts for all purposes.\u201d 814 F.3d at 630. \nIn Chen, the Court held the same with respect to registra-\ntion under New York law. See 954 F.3d at 499. Most rele-\nvant here, the Court did so in part because giving \u201cbroader \n\n112a \n \n \neffect\u201d to the registration statutes \u201cwould implicate Due \nProcess and other constitutional concerns.\u201d Brown, 814 \nF.3d at 626; accord Chen, 954 F.3d at 498-99. \u201cIf mere reg-\nistration and the accompanying appointment of an in-state \nagent \u2014 without an express consent to general jurisdic-\ntion \u2014 nonetheless sufficed to confer general jurisdiction \nby implicit consent,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cevery corpora-\ntion would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state \nin which it registered, and Daimler\u2019s ruling would be \nrobbed of meaning by a back- door thief.\u201d Brown, 814 F.3d \nat 640; accord Chen, 954 F.3d at 499. \nAdmittedly, Brown and Chen do not speak directly to \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA. The plaintiffs in both \ncases argued that the statutes at issue gave rise to general \njurisdiction. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs and the United \nStates make no such argument, as the PSJVTA\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional provisions are specific to claims against Defendants \nunder the ATA. Moreover, the statutes at issue in Brown \nand Chen were not explicit in deeming registration to be \nconsent. The PSJVTA, of course, is. In point of fact, \nBrown and Chen explicitly left open the possibility \u201cthat a \ncarefully drawn state statute that expressly required con-\nsent to general jurisdiction as a condition on a foreign cor-\nporation\u2019s doing business in the state, at least in cases \nbrought by state residents, might well be constitutional,\u201d \nBrown, 814 F.3d at 641 (emphasis added), and ultimately \ndid not reach the question squarely presented here, \nnamely whether a court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant, \u201ceven when exercised pursuant to [the \ndefendant\u2019s] purported \u2018consent,\u2019 [is] limited by the Due \nProcess clause,\u201d id.6 But the decisions strongly suggest \u2014 \n \n6 The Brown Court noted that Pennsylvania\u2019s registration statute \n\u201cmore plainly advise[d] the registrant that enrolling in the state as a \nforeign corporation and transacting business will vest the local courts \n\n113a \n \n \neven if they do not hold \u2014 that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdic-\ntion is limited by the Due Process Clause and that allowing \nCongress by legislative fiat to simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct that \nwould otherwise not support personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States to be \u201cconsent,\u201d as it tried to do here, would \n\u201crob[]\u201d the case law conditioning personal jurisdiction on \nsufficient contacts with the forum \u201cof meaning by a back-\ndoor thief.\u201d Id. at 640. \nNotably, in arguing that the PSJVTA passes constitu-\ntional muster, Plaintiffs and the United States do not dis-\npute that a statute \u201cdeeming\u201d certain conduct to be \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction must be consistent with due \nprocess. See U.S. Mem. 7-9; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13. In their view, \nhowever, to comply with due process, a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \n \nwith general jurisdiction over the corporation,\u201d 814 F.3d at 640 (citing \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i)-(ii)), and that the Third Circuit had \nheld that the statute was consistent with due process, see id. (citing \nBane v. Netlink, Inc., 925 F.2d 637, 640 (3d Cir. 1991)). (The Pennsyl-\nvania statute is apparently the only registration statute in the country \nthat is explicit in deeming registration to be consent. See Asbestos \nProds. Liab. Litig., 384 F. Supp. 3d at 539.) Notably, however, the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court recently held that, following Daimler, \nthe statutory scheme could not be squared with the Due Process \nClause. See Mallory v. Norfolk S. Rwy. Co., \u2014 A.3d \u2014, 2021 WL \n6067172, at *14-21 (Pa. Dec. 22, 2021). The Court acknowledged that \nthe state\u2019s business registration statute put foreign corporations on \nnotice that registration would be deemed consent, but concluded that \nsuch \u201cnotice . . . does not render the consent voluntary.\u201d Id. at *19. \n(In so holding, the Court rested in part on the \u201cunconstitutional con-\nditions doctrine.\u201d See id. at *20. Defendants here advert to that doc-\ntrine, but only in a footnote. See Defs.\u2019 Mem. 14 n.3. Accordingly, the \nCourt deems any argument with respect to the doctrine to have been \nabandoned. See, e.g., Fieldcamp v. City of New York, 242 F. Supp. 2d \n388, 391 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\u201c[T]he failure to provide argument on a point \nat issue constitutes abandonment of the issue.\u201d); accord Wilmington \nTr., N.A. v. 115 Owner LLC, No. 20-CV-2157 (JMF), 2021 WL \n5086368, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2021).) \n\n114a \n \n \nstatute need only give defendants \u201cfair warning about \nwhat conduct will subject them to personal jurisdiction \nwith respect to a particular class of claims, and a reasona-\nble period to structure their primary conduct with some \nminimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will \nnot render them liable to suit.\u201d U.S. Mem. 9 (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13.7 If a statute does \nso, they argue, a defendant who thereafter engages in the \npredicate conduct has \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d con-\nsented to jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction over \nsuch a defendant comports with due process. As applied \nhere, Plaintiffs and the United States argue that Defend-\nants knowingly and voluntarily \u201cconsented\u201d because they \n\u201cknew\u201d the activities that would \u201cbe deemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction and were given \u201cthe opportunity to \u2018voluntar-\nily\u2019 choose whether or not to continue such activities and \nthereby consent to jurisdiction in the courts of the United \nStates.\u201d U.S. Mem. 10; see Pls.\u2019 Supp. Mem. 5. In short, in \ntheir view, nothing more than fair notice and an oppor-\ntunity to conform is required for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to sat-\nisfy due process. \nThe Court cannot agree. Separate and apart from the \nfact that the argument of Plaintiffs and the United States \nis the very one rejected by the Supreme Court in College \n \n7 Plaintiffs add that, to pass muster under the Due Process Clause, a \ndeemed consent statute also has to serve a \u201clegitimate governmental \nobjective\u201d so as to \u201cavoid[] the arbitrary or irrational exercise of \npower.\u201d Pls.\u2019 Mem. 13-16 (citing Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n846 (1998)). True enough: \u201cThe touchstone of due process is protec-\ntion of the individual against arbitrary action of government.\u201d Wolff \nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974). But this additional prong adds \nlittle to Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed test (and is easily satisfied here in any \nevent), as \u201conly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be \narbitrary in the constitutional sense and therefore unconstitutional.\u201d \nTenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581, 600 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up). \nThus, the Court need not and does not address it further. \n\n115a \n \n \nSavings Bank, to accept it would effectively mean that \nthere are no due process limitations on the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Congress or a state legislature could \nprovide for jurisdiction over any defendant for any con-\nduct so long as the conduct post-dated enactment of the \nlaw at issue. That is, Congress or the legislature could \nsimply \u201cdeem\u201d a substantive violation of the law at issue to \nbe \u201cconsent\u201d and, on that basis, subject any defendant who \nlater committed a violation to jurisdiction without regard \nfor its \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations\u201d with the forum. Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 319. Congress, for example, could simply \n\u201cdeem\u201d a substantive violation of the ATA to mean that a \ndefendant had \u201cconsented\u201d to jurisdiction. Or, perhaps \nmore revealingly, a state legislature could pass a statute \ndeclaring that any foreign corporation that distributed ve-\nhicles to in-state dealerships would be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in that state \u2014 circum-\nventing the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Daimler. 571 U.S. \nat 136; cf. Coll. Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 683 (\u201cRecogniz-\ning a congressional power to exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners would also, as a practical matter, permit Congress to \ncircumvent the antiabrogation holding of Seminole Tribe \n[of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996)].\u201d). In short, to \nhold that fair notice and an opportunity to conform one\u2019s \nbehavior are the only requirements for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \njurisdiction to comport with due process would be to hold \nthat personal jurisdiction is limited only by reach of the \nlegislative imagination \u2014 which is to say, that there are no \nconstitutional limits at all. \nCongress should not be permitted to circumvent fun-\ndamental constitutional rights through such sleight of \nhand. See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. R.R. Comm\u2019n, \n271 U.S. 583, 593 (1926) (\u201c[C]onstitutional guarantees, so \ncarefully safeguarded against direct assault, [should not \n\n116a \n \n \nbe] open to destruction by the indirect but no less effective \nprocess of requiring a surrender which, though in form \nvoluntary, in fact lacks none of the elements of compul-\nsion.\u201d). Indeed, to give such power to a legislature would \nbe to violate the longstanding proposition that \u201cit was not \nleft to the legislative power to enact any process which \nmight be devised\u201d and that due process \u201ccannot be so con-\nstrued as to leave Congress free to make any process \u2018due \nprocess of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Ho-\nboken Land & Improvement Co., 59 U.S. 272, 276 (1856); \nsee Quill Corp. v. N. Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 305 (1992) (not-\ning that Congress does not \u201chave the power to authorize \nviolations of the Due Process Clause\u201d), overruled on other \ngrounds by S. Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080 \n(2018). More directly on point, it would offend the funda-\nmental principle that a statute \u201ccannot create personal ju-\nrisdiction where the Constitution forbids it.\u201d In re Terror-\nist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks omitted), abrogated on other \ngrounds by Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305 (2010); see \nPrice v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 \nF.3d 82, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that a stat-\nute cannot grant personal jurisdiction where the Constitu-\ntion forbids it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Or as \nthe Second Circuit put it in Waldman I (when rejecting \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the PLO and the PA had con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction through their appointment \nof an agent for service of process in Washington): A stat-\nute cannot itself \u201canswer the constitutional question of \nwhether due process is satisfied.\u201d 835 F.3d at 343 (empha-\nsis added). \nMoreover, as the Supreme Court\u2019s reference to the \njury trial right in College Savings Bank makes plain, to \naccept the argument advanced by Plaintiffs and the \nUnited States could (and likely would) have staggering \n\n117a \n \n \nimplications beyond the realm of personal jurisdiction. Af-\nter all, the concepts of consent and waiver have legal sig-\nnificance with respect to a host of individual constitutional \nrights. Law enforcement may conduct a warrantless \nsearch on consent. See, e.g., Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, \n412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973). A defendant cannot be prose-\ncuted for a felony absent an indictment unless he waives \nthe right to be indicted by a grant jury. See, e.g., Matthews \nv. United States, 622 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 2010). Parties \nentitled to a civil jury trial under the Seventh Amendment \ncan consent to a bench trial. See, e.g., Texas v. Penguin \nGrp. (USA) Inc., No. 11-MD-2293 (DLC), 2013 WL \n1759567, at *6-7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2013). Parties in a fed-\neral civil case are entitled to litigate their claims before an \nArticle III judicial officer absent consent to proceed by \nother means. See, e.g., Wellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sha-\nrif, 575 U.S. 665, 674-78 (2015). And so on. To accept that \nfair notice and an opportunity to alter conduct are all that \nis required for a legislature to \u201cdeem\u201d conduct to be \u201ccon-\nsent\u201d is to accept that the rights underlying these doc-\ntrines are subject to mere legislative whim. Congress \ncould simply say that a person who is arrested on probable \ncause with a cellphone is \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \u201cconsented\u201d to \na search of the phone, cf. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, \n386 (2014) (holding that law enforcement officers \u201cmust \ngenerally secure a warrant\u201d before searching a cellphone \nseized incident to an arrest); that by merely filing or an-\nswering a lawsuit in federal court, a party is \u201cdeemed\u201d to \nhave \u201cconsented\u201d to a bench trial or to have \u201cconsented\u201d to \nthe jurisdiction of a Magistrate Judge; and so on. Consti-\ntutional rights are not so fickle. \nConspicuously, Plaintiffs and the United States do not \ncite any case suggesting, let alone holding, that a legisla-\nture may simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct unrelated to actual con-\nsent to be consent, in the personal jurisdiction context or \n\n118a \n \n \notherwise.8 The closest they come is the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision in Bauxites, but Bauxites does not bear the \nweight they put on it. In Bauxites, the district court found \nthat the petitioners had violated various discovery orders \nrelating the question of personal jurisdiction. Exercising \nits authority under Rule 37(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the district court sanctioned the peti-\ntioners by deeming the facts that formed the basis for per-\nsonal jurisdiction to be established. On appeal, the peti-\ntioners argued that this violated due process because a \ncourt \u201cmay not create\u201d personal jurisdiction \u201cby judicial \nfiat.\u201d 456 U.S. at 695. The Supreme Court rejected the \nargument, holding that application of Rule 37(b)(2) sup-\nported the presumption, established in Hammond Pack-\ning Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 351 (1909), \u201cthat the re-\nfusal to produce evidence material to the administration of \n \n8 Plaintiffs and the United States both rely on Wellness Interna-\ntional Network and Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580 (2003), see U.S. \nMem. 13-14; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 14, but neither case provides support for their \ncause. In each case, the Court blessed the concept of implied consent \n(in Wellness International Network, for consent to the jurisdiction of \na bankruptcy judge and in Roell, for consent to the jurisdiction of a \nmagistrate judge) and stressed that \u201cconsent \u2014 whether express or \nimplied \u2014 must still be knowing and voluntary.\u201d Wellness Int\u2019l Net-\nwork, 575 U.S. at 685. But neither case identified a standard for de-\ntermining what conduct constitutes implied consent, let alone ad-\ndressed whether or when a legislature can simply \u201cdeem\u201d conduct to \nbe consent. If anything, the decisions support the proposition that \nconduct constitutes consent only where the party\u2019s actual acquies-\ncence can be inferred, as they held that a party\u2019s consent to a non-\nArticle III adjudicator turns on whether it \u201cvoluntarily appeared\u201d be-\nfore that adjudicator. Id. at 685; Roell, 538 U.S. at 590. \u201cAppearance\u201d \nis defined, in turn, as \u201cthe overt act by which a party submits himself \nto the court\u2019s jurisdiction. An appearance may be expressly made . . . \nor it may be implied from some act done with the intention of appear-\ning and submitting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Roell, 538 U.S. at 586 \nn.3 (emphases added). \n\n119a \n \n \ndue process was but an admission of the want of merit in \nthe asserted defense.\u201d 456 U.S. at 705-06. \u201cThe sanction,\u201d \nthe Court concluded, \u201ctook as established the facts \u2014 con-\ntacts with Pennsylvania \u2014 that [the respondent] was seek-\ning to establish through discovery. That a particular legal \nconsequence \u2014 personal jurisdiction of the court over the \ndefendants \u2014 follows from this, does not in any way affect \nthe appropriateness of the sanction.\u201d Id. at 709. \nBauxites, therefore, stands for the straightforward \nproposition that where a defendant voluntarily submits to \nthe jurisdiction of a court for purposes of disputing juris-\ndiction and then violates orders with respect to jurisdic-\ntional discovery, it does not offend due process to deem \nthe facts supporting personal jurisdiction to be estab-\nlished. Critically, however, the petitioners\u2019 conduct was \nrelated to the litigation itself \u2014 in which petitioners had \nvoluntarily appeared (albeit for the limited purpose of \ndisputing jurisdiction). See id. at 706 (\u201cA defendant is al-\nways free to ignore the judicial proceedings, risk a de-\nfault judgment, and then challenge that judgment on ju-\nrisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding. By sub-\nmitting to the jurisdiction of the court for the limited pur-\npose of challenging jurisdiction, the defendant agrees to \nabide by that court\u2019s determination on the issue of juris-\ndiction.\u201d (citation omitted)). Moreover, the petitioners \nwere not deemed to have consented to the court\u2019s juris-\ndiction through their conduct; indeed, the Court made \nclear that such a direct sanction would indeed have vio-\nlated due process. See 456 U.S. at 706 (citing Hovey v. El-\nliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897)). \nInstead, the petitioners\u2019 conduct in Bauxites was suffi-\ncient to support a presumption of fact \u2014 namely, that they \nhad contacts with Pennsylvania \u2014 that, in turn, had the \nlegal consequence of establishing personal jurisdiction. In \n\n120a \n \n \nother words, the Court blessed a legal fiction, but only be-\ncause the fiction was not so far detached from fact. See id. \nat 701 (quoting Justice Holmes\u2019s opinion in McDonald v. \nMabee, 243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917), for the proposition that \n\u201c\u2018great caution should be used not to let fiction deny the \nfair play that can be secured only by a pretty close adhe-\nsion to fact\u2019\u201d). Additionally, the Court took pains to state \nthat its holding \u201cdoes not alter the requirement that there \nbe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 between the nonresident defendant \nand the forum \nRather, our holding deals with how \nthe facts needed to show those \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 can be \nestablished when a defendant fails to comply with court-\nordered discovery.\u201d Id. at 703 n.10. If anything, therefore, \nBauxites supports the conclusion that a court may not ex-\nercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, based on \npurported consent or otherwise, unless the defendant has \nsufficient \u201ccontacts, ties, or relations\u201d with the forum \n\u201csuch that the maintenance of the suit does not offend tra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316, 319 (internal quotation marks omit-\nted).9 \nSeparately, Plaintiffs and the United States fall back \non the deference that courts owe to the political branches \nwith respect to matters of foreign affairs and national se-\ncurity. See U.S. Mem. 10-13, 19; Pls.\u2019 Mem. 14-16. But \ntheir argument is unavailing for several reasons. First, \n \n9 To be sure, Bauxites does state that \u201c[t]he actions of the defendant \nmay amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court, \nwhether voluntary or not.\u201d 456 U.S. at 704-05 (emphasis added). Read \nin context, however, the phrase \u201cor not\u201d plainly refers to situations \nother than consent in which a defendant\u2019s actions nevertheless legally \namount to submission to the jurisdiction of a court. To read it other-\nwise would violate the fundamental proposition \u2014 endorsed, of course, \nby Plaintiffs and the United States themselves \u2014 that consent must \nbe knowing and voluntary in order to be valid. \n\n121a \n \n \nalthough courts should grant deference to the political \nbranches when it comes to such matters in light of their \nconstitutionally derived powers and expertise, \u201cconcerns \nof national security and foreign relations do not warrant \nabdication of the judicial role. . . . [T]he Government\u2019s au-\nthority and expertise in these matters do not automatically \ntrump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the protection \nthat the Constitution grants to individuals.\u201d Holder v. Hu-\nmanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 34 (2010) (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see Open Soc\u2019y Just. Initiative v. \nDep\u2019t of Def., No. 20-CV-5096 (JMF), 2021 WL 3038528, at \n*7 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2021) (\u201cJudicial deference in the area \nof national security is certainly warranted. But deference \nis not equivalent to acquiescence.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). Indeed, the courts\u2019 \u201crespect for Con-\ngress\u2019s policy judgments\u201d cannot \u201cdisavow restraints on \nfederal power that the Constitution carefully constructed\u201d \nbecause courts \u201cenforce the limits on federal power by \nstriking down acts of Congress that transgress those lim-\nits.\u201d NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012). As Justice \nSouter once put it: \u201cEven Justice Sutherland\u2019s reading of \nthe National Government\u2019s \u2018inherent\u2019 foreign affairs \npower . . . contained the caveat that the power, \u2018like every \nother governmental power, must be exercised in subordi-\nnation to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d \nAm. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 417 n.9 (2003) \n(quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., \n299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). \nThe constitutional limits on the political branches\u2019 ex-\nercise of the treaty power underscore the point. The Con-\nstitution explicitly grants the President the \u201cPower, by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate to make \nTreaties.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2. And treaties, by defi-\nnition, implicate foreign relations. Yet, the law is pellucid \nthat \u201cthe treaty power cannot override constitutional \n\n122a \n \n \nlimitations respecting individual rights.\u201d Oneida Indian \nNation of N.Y. v. State of N.Y., 860 F.2d 1145, 1163 (2d Cir. \n1988) (citing Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1957) (plu-\nrality opinion)); see Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n, 539 U.S. at 416 & n.9 \n(\u201c[Treaties are s]ubject . . . to the Constitution\u2019s guaran-\ntees of individual rights.\u201d); In re Premises Located at 840 \n140th Ave. NE, Bellevue, Wash., 634 F.3d 557, 571 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201cTreaties, like statutes, are subject to constitu-\ntional limits, including the separation of powers and the \nguarantee of due process.\u201d). If the political branches can-\nnot use the treaty power \u2014 despite its explicit constitu-\ntional provenance and the fact that it is wielded, by defini-\ntion, in the realm of foreign affairs \u2014 to override an indi-\nvidual\u2019s due process rights, they surely cannot do so here \neither. \nSecond, and in any event, Plaintiffs and the United \nStates do not cite, and the Court has not found, any au-\nthority for the proposition that the test for personal juris-\ndiction \u2014 which, again, is an individual constitutional right \n\u2014 varies by context or by the nature of a plaintiff\u2019s claim. \nSee Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56 (\u201c[A]lthough congressional in-\nterests may be relevant to whether personal jurisdiction \ncomports with due-process standards, they cannot change \nthe standards themselves.\u201d (citation omitted)); see also \nWaldman I, 835 F.3d at 329-30 & n.10 (holding that per-\nsonal jurisdiction standards are the same under the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments, citing cases against foreign \ndefendants and involving terrorism, and specifically re-\njecting the argument that there is \u201c\u2018universal\u2019 \u2014 or limit-\nless \u2014 personal jurisdiction in terrorism cases\u201d). And fi-\nnally, such an \u201cexpansive view\u201d of Congress\u2019s authority to \ncreate personal jurisdiction where it otherwise would not \nexist, even if limited to the context of foreign affairs, would \npay insufficient \u201cheed to the risks to international comity.\u201d \nDaimler, 571 U.S. at 141. \u201cConsiderations of international \n\n123a \n \n \nrapport thus reinforce\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cdetermination that \nsubjecting\u201d foreign parties to jurisdiction based on con-\nduct that has no direct contact with the United States, let \nalone nexus with litigation in the United States, \u201cwould not \naccord with the \u2018fair play and substantial justice\u2019 due pro-\ncess demands.\u201d Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316). \nIn the final analysis, the Court cannot acquiesce in \nCongress\u2019s legislative sleight of hand and exercise juris-\ndiction over Defendants here pursuant to the PSVJTA. A \ndefendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary consent is a valid basis \nto subject it to the jurisdiction of a court, but Congress \ncannot simply declare anything it wants to be consent. To \nhold otherwise would let fiction get the better of fact and \nmake a mockery of the Due Process Clause. See McDon-\nald, 243 U.S. at 91 (Holmes, J.) (\u201c[G]reat caution should be \nused not to let fiction deny the fair play that can be secured \nonly by a pretty close adhesion to fact\u201d); M3 USA Corp. v. \nQamoum, No. CV 20-2903 (RDM), 2021 WL 2324753, at \n*12 (D.D.C. June 7, 2021) (\u201c[T]he Court must avoid treat-\ning \u2018consent\u2019 as simply a \u2018legal fiction\u2019 devoid of content or \nengaging in \u2018circular\u2019 reasoning that premises \u2018consent\u2019 on \nthe presumption that defendants know the law and then \ndefines the law so that anyone engaging in the defined con-\nduct is deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d). That is not to say that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdic-\ntion in all its forms would necessarily be unconstitutional.10 \n \n10 Nor is it to say that Defendants are correct in arguing that \n\u201c\u2018deemed\u2019 consent to jurisdiction cannot be squared with Due Process \nunless there is reciprocity,\u201d which they define as \u201can express or im-\nplied exchange by which a defendant impliedly agrees to jurisdiction \nin return for a benefit conferred by the forum,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. 1 (empha-\nsis added). Although there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s re-\nceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent, see, e.g., Hess v. Paw-\nloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356-57 (1927); cf. J.

Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318. \nIt follows that exercising jurisdiction under the facts of \nthis case does not comport with due process and Defend-\nants\u2019 motion must be granted. \nCONCLUSION \nAs in Waldman I, the killing of Ari Fuld was \u201cunques-\ntionably horrific\u201d and Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to seek justice on \nhis and their own behalf are morally compelling. 835 F.3d \nat 344. \u201cBut,\u201d as the Second Circuit emphasized in its de-\ncision, \u201cthe federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a \ncivil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process \nclause of the Constitution, no matter how horrendous the \nunderlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims.\u201d Id. at 344. For the reasons discussed above, the \nCourt concludes that exercising jurisdiction here would in-\ndeed go beyond the limits prescribed by the Due Process \nClause. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, \n \nconduct, from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from \nand thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum State\u201d); Coll. \nSavings Bank, 527 U.S. at 686 (\u201cCongress may, in the exercise of its \nspending power, condition its grant of funds to the States upon their \ntaking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take, \nand that acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the ac-\ntions.\u201d), Defendants do not cite, and the Court has not found, any case \nholding that such receipt of a benefit is a necessary condition. See \nalso, e.g., Sun Forest Corp. v. Shvili, 152 F. Supp. 2d 367, 380 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (Lynch, J.) (\u201c[V]oluntary consent to jurisdiction need \nnot be supported by consideration.\u201d). \n\n125a \n \n \nthe Court concludes that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for \nlack of personal jurisdiction must be and is GRANTED. \nAs a result, the Court need not and does not reach Defend-\nants\u2019 other arguments for dismissal. \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. \n24, to close this case, and to enter judgment for Defend-\nants. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  January 6, 2022 \n \nNew York, New York \n \nJESSE M.

The plaintiffs contend that the newly enacted \nATCA provides federal courts with jurisdiction over the \ndefendants in this case and thus the mandate should be \nrecalled. The extraordinary remedy of recalling a mandate \nis not warranted in this case, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion is \naccordingly DENIED. \n \nKENT A. YALOWITZ AND DAVID C.

Koeltl, of the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York, sitting by designation. \n\n130a \n \n \nattacks in Israel that killed or wounded the plaintiffs or \ntheir family members. After a seven-week trial, the jury \nawarded the plaintiffs damages which, after trebling, \namounted to $655.5 million. On appeal, this Court held that \nthe federal courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. This Court \nvacated the judgment of the district court and remanded \nthe case with instructions to dismiss the action. The man-\ndate issued on November 28, 2016, and the Supreme Court \ndenied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari on \nApril 2, 2018. The plaintiffs have now moved to recall the \nmandate based on the recently enacted Anti-Terrorism \nClarification Act (\u201cATCA\u201d). \nThe ATCA became law on October 3, 2018. Pub. L. \nNo. 115-253, 132 Stat 3183 (2018). Section 4 of the ATCA, \nwhich added a subsection (e) to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334, specifies \nactivities by which certain parties shall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction. The provision states \nthat \u201cregardless of the date of the occurrence of the act of \ninternational terrorism upon which [a] civil action \n[brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333] was filed,\u201d a defendant \nshall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \nin such action if the defendant either (a) accepts any of \nthree specified forms of assistance after the date that is \n120 days after Section 4 of the ATCA was enacted or (b) is \n\u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension of section 1003 of \nthe [ATA]\u201d and, after the date that is 120 days after Sec-\ntion 4 of the ATCA was enacted, establishes or continues \nto maintain \u201cany office, headquarters, premises, or other \nfacilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States.\u201d1 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1). \n \n1 Section 1003 of the ATA provides that: \nIt shall be unlawful, if the purpose be to further the interests of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor to any of those, or any agents thereof . . . \n\n131a \n \n \nOn October 8, 2018, the plaintiffs filed the present mo-\ntion to recall the mandate issued in this case. They argue \nthat Section 4 of the ATCA provides the federal courts \nwith jurisdiction over the defendants with respect to the \nplaintiffs\u2019 claims. The defendants counter that the plain-\ntiffs have failed to show circumstances that warrant the \nextraordinary remedy of recalling the mandate and that, \nin any event, Section 4 of the ATCA does not apply retro-\nactively to closed cases. \nI. \nThe federal courts of appeals \u201cpossess an inherent \npower to recall [a] mandate, subject to review for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d Taylor v. United States, 822 F.3d 84, 90 (2d \n \n(1) to receive anything of value except informational material \nfrom the PLO or any of its constituent groups, any successor \nthereto, or any agents thereof; \n(2) to expend funds from the PLO or any of its constituent \ngroups, any successor thereto, or any agents thereof; or \n(3) notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, to es-\ntablish or maintain an office, headquarters, premises, or other fa-\ncilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the United \nStates at the behest or direction of, or with funds provided by the \nPalestine Liberation Organization or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor to any of those, or any agents thereof. \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202. The President of the United States may waive this \nprovision  \nif the President determines and certifies in writing to the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Sen-\nate, and the appropriate congressional committees that the Palestin-\nians have not, after the date of enactment of this Act [either (1) taken \ncertain steps at the U.N. or (2) taken certain actions vis-\u00e0-vis the \nInternational Criminal Court]. \nKlieman v. Palestinian Auth., --- F.3d ----, 2019 WL 2093018, at *12 \n(D.C. Cir. May 14, 2019) (alteration and emphasis in Klieman) (quot-\ning Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No. 114-113, 129 \nStat. 2242, 2780 (2015)). \n\n132a \n \n \nCir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted, alteration in origi-\nnal). Recalling a mandate is an extraordinary remedy to \nbe used \u201csparing[ly].\u201d Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. \n538, 550 (1998); Taylor, 822 F.3d at 90. Courts are reluc-\ntant to recall a mandate because of \u201cthe need to preserve \nfinality in judicial proceedings.\u201d Sargent v. Columbia For-\nest Prod., Inc., 75 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1996). Although the \npassage of a new law might warrant recalling a mandate \nin some circumstances, this is not such a case. \nII. \nA. \nThe plaintiffs have not shown that either factual pred-\nicate of Section 4 of the ATCA has been satisfied. As to the \nfirst factual predicate, acceptance of a qualifying form of \nUnited States assistance, the plaintiffs state only that the \ndefendants have accepted qualifying assistance in the \npast; they do not contend that the defendants currently do \nso. Meanwhile, in Klieman v. Palestinian  Authority, \nwhich was decided on May 14, 2019, the Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit accepted the represen-\ntation the Department of Justice made in an amicus curiae \nbrief that neither the PLO nor the PA accept United \nStates assistance. --- F.3d ----, 2019 WL 2093018, at *10 \n(D.C. Cir. May 14, 2019). The papers the plaintiffs filed in \nconnection with this motion do not provide any reason to \ndoubt the Department of Justice\u2019s representation or the \nKlieman court\u2019s adoption of that representation. \nThe plaintiffs also fail to show that, in accordance with \nSection 4\u2019s second factual predicate, the defendants bene-\nfit from a waiver or suspension of Section 1003 of the ATA \nand have established or continued to maintain an office or \nother facility \u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \nBoth conditions are necessary under Section 4\u2019s second \nfactual predicate. Klieman, 2019 WL 2093018 at *10. \n\n133a \n \n \nAs to the first condition, the plaintiffs have not estab-\nlished that the defendants benefit from an express waiver \nor suspension under Section 1003 of the ATA. The plain-\ntiffs contend that an express waiver is not required by Sec-\ntion 4 of the ATCA, and that the President impliedly sus-\npended Section 1003 of the ATA with respect to the de-\nfendants by permitting the defendants to engage in con-\nduct allowed only if Section 1003 were suspended. But the \nKlieman court persuasively rejected a similar argument, \nreasoning that allowing implied waivers to qualify under \nSection 4 of the ATCA would \u201cneglect the actual language \nof the legal authorization to issue waivers under [ATA] \n\u00a7 1003, . . . which creates legal consequences when the \nPresident \u2018certifies in writing\u2019 that a waiver is to be is-\nsued.\u201d 2019 WL 2093018 at *12. The plaintiffs in this case \nhave not put forth anything that could qualify as, or sub-\nstitute for, an express waiver or suspension under Section \n1003 of the ATA. \nMoreover, the plaintiffs in this case have not shown \nthat the defendants have established or continued to main-\ntain an office or other facility within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States. Although the PLO maintains its United \nNations Observer Mission in New York, the prohibitions \nof Section 1003 of the ATA do not apply to that office. \nKlinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione \nMotonave Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, 46 (2d Cir. 1991); \nsee United States v.  Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. \nSupp. 1456, 1465 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (finding the ATA inap-\nplicable to the PLO Observer Mission). The Observer Mis-\nsion is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States. See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51 (\u201c[T]he \nPLO\u2019s participation in the UN is dependent on the legal \nfiction that the UN Headquarters is not really United \nStates territory at all, but is rather neutral ground over \nwhich the United States has ceded control.\u201d). \n\n134a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs point out that, according to Klinghoffer, \n\u201cactivities not conducted in furtherance of the PLO\u2019s ob-\nserver status may properly be considered as a basis of ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d Id. at 51. But this statement was made in ref-\nerence to determining whether such activities conferred \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO under \u00a7 301 of the New \nYork Civil Practice Laws and Rules. Nothing in Kling-\nhoffer suggests that the PLO\u2019s engaging in activities un-\nrelated to its observer status transforms the PLO\u2019s Ob-\nserver Mission into an office or other facility for the PLO \n\u201cwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \nIn sum, the plaintiffs have provided no basis to con-\nclude that a factual predicate of Section 4 of the ATCA has \nbeen met in this case. \nB. \nThis Court\u2019s interest in finality also weighs against re-\ncalling the mandate. When its factual predicates are met, \nSection 4 provides jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cregard-\nless of the date of the occurrence of the act of international \nterrorism upon which [the relevant] civil action was filed,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1), providing that the defendant sub-\nsequently commits certain acts. But irrespective of \nwhether this language suggests that Section 4 applies ret-\nroactively to pending cases, such as the appeal in Klieman, \nit does not suggest that courts should reopen cases that \nare no longer pending. Legislation applies prospectively \nunless Congress explicitly provides for retroactive appli-\ncation. Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257, 265\u201366 (2012); see \nLandgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 272\u201373 (1994). \nAnd it is well-established that retroactive laws generally \ndo not affect valid, final judgments. See Bank Markazi v. \nPeterson, 136 S. Ct. 1310, 1323 (2016) (\u201cCongress . . . may \nnot \u2018retroactively comman[d] the federal courts to reopen \nfinal judgments.\u2019\u201d (quoting Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, \nInc., 514 U.S. 211, 219 (1995) (alteration in original))). The \n\n135a \n \n \nmandate in this case was issued two and a half years ago, \nand the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a \nwrit of certiorari more than six months before the plain-\ntiffs filed their motion to recall the mandate. The ATCA \ndoes not provide explicitly or implicitly that closed cases \ncan be reopened. Recalling the mandate now would offend \n\u201cthe need to preserve finality in judicial proceedings.\u201d \nTaylor, 822 F.3d at 90 (quotation marks omitted).2  \nCONCLUSION \nThis case does not warrant invoking the extraordi-\nnary remedy of recalling a mandate issued two and a half \nyears ago. The Court has considered all the arguments of \nthe parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, they \nare either moot or without merit. For the reasons ex-\nplained above, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to recall the mandate \nis DENIED. \n \n \n \n2 The plaintiffs in this case have filed a new complaint in the South-\nern District of New York. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, No. 18cv12213 (S.D.N.Y.). To the extent that there are any de-\nvelopments in the activities of the PA or the PLO that may subject \nthem to personal jurisdiction under the ATCA, they can be raised in \nthat case. \n\n \n \n(136a) \nAPPENDIX G \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n \nCase Argued: April 12, 2016  \nCase Decided: August 31, 2016 \nMotion Filed: October 8, 2018 \nMotion Decided: June 3, 2019 \nDocket Nos. 15-3135-cv (Lead); 15-3151-cv (XAP) \nEVA WALDMAN, REVITAL BAUER, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS \nNATURAL GUARDIAN OF PLAINTIFFS YEHONATHON \nBAUER, BINYAMIN BAUER, DANIEL BAUER AND YEHUDA \nBAUER, SHAUL MANDELKORN, NURIT MANDELKORN, OZ \nJOSEPH GUETTA, MINOR, BY HIS NEXT FRIEND AND \nGUARDIAN VARDA GUETTA, VARDA GUETTA, \nINDIVIDUALLY AND AS NATURAL GUARDIAN OF PLAINTIFF \nOZ JOSEPH GUETTA, NORMAN GRITZ, INDIVIDUALLY AND \nAS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF \nDAVID GRITZ, MARK I.

A jury found the defendants---the Palestine \nLiberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority---\nliable under the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a), for various terror attacks in Israel that killed or \nwounded United States citizens.  The jury awarded the \nplaintiffs damages of $218.5 million, an amount that was \ntrebled automatically pursuant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total award to $655.5 million.  The \ndefendants appeal, arguing that the district court lacked \ngeneral and specific personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants, and, in the alternative, seek a new trial because the \ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing certain tes-\ntimony by two expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs cross-ap-\npeal, asking this Court to reinstate claims the district \ncourt dismissed. \nWe vacate the judgment of the district court and re-\nmand the case with instructions to dismiss the action be-\ncause the federal courts lack personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendants with respect to the claims in this action.

Koeltl, District Judge: \nIn this case, eleven American families sued the Pales-\ntine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian \nAuthority (\u201cPA\u201d) (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d)1 under the \nAnti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), for var-\nious terror attacks in Israel that killed or wounded the \nplaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) or their \nfamily members.2  \nThe defendants repeatedly argued before the District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York that the court \nlacked personal jurisdiction over them in light of their \nminimal presence in, and the lack of any nexus between \nthe facts underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the United \nStates.  The district court (Daniels, J.) concluded that it \n \n1  While other defendants, such as Yasser Arafat, were named as de-\nfendants in the case, they did not appear, and the Judgment was en-\ntered only against the PLO and the PA. \n2  The plaintiffs are United States citizens, and the guardians, family \nmembers, and personal representatives of the estates of United States \ncitizens, who were killed or injured in the terrorist attacks. \n\n141a \n \n \nhad general personal jurisdiction over the defendants, \neven after the Supreme Court narrowed the test for gen-\neral jurisdiction in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 \n(2014).  See Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 04-\ncv-397 (GBD), 2014 WL 6811395, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, \n2014); see also Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. \n04-cv-397 (GBD), 2011 WL 1345086, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. \n30, 2011). \nAfter a seven-week trial, a jury found that the defend-\nants, acting through their employees, perpetrated the at-\ntacks and that the defendants knowingly provided mate-\nrial support to organizations designated by the United \nStates State Department as foreign terrorist organiza-\ntions.  The jury awarded the plaintiffs damages of $218.5 \nmillion, an amount that was trebled automatically pursu-\nant to the ATA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total \naward to $655.5 million. \nOn appeal, the defendants seek to overturn the jury\u2019s \nverdict by arguing that the United States Constitution \nprecludes the exercise of personal jurisdiction over them.  \nIn the alternative, the defendants seek a new trial, arguing \nthat the district court abused its discretion by allowing \ncertain testimony by two expert witnesses.  The plaintiffs \ncross-appeal, asking this Court to reinstate non-federal \nclaims that the district court dismissed, and reinstate the \nclaims of two plaintiffs for which the district court found \ninsufficient evidence to submit to the jury. \nWe conclude that the district court erred when it con-\ncluded it had personal jurisdiction over the defendants \nwith respect to the claims at issue in this action.  There-\nfore, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and \nREMAND the case to the district court with instructions \nto DISMISS the case for want of personal jurisdiction.  Ac-\ncordingly, we do not consider the defendants\u2019 other \n\n142a \n \n \narguments on appeal or the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, all of \nwhich are now moot. \nI. \nA. \nThe PA was established by the 1993 Oslo Accords as \nthe interim and non-sovereign government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip (collectively referred to \nhere as \u201cPalestine\u201d).  The PA is headquartered in the city \nof Ramallah in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Pres-\nident and the PA\u2019s ministers reside. \nThe PLO was founded in 1964.  At all relevant times, \nthe PLO was headquartered in Ramallah, the Gaza Strip, \nand Amman, Jordan.  Because the Oslo Accords limit the \nPA\u2019s authority to Palestine, the PLO conducts Palestine\u2019s \nforeign affairs. \nDuring the relevant time period for this action, the \nPLO maintained over 75 embassies, missions, and delega-\ntions around the world.  The PLO is registered with the \nUnited States Government as a foreign agent.  The PLO \nhas two diplomatic offices in the United States: a mission \nto the United States in Washington, D.C. and a mission to \nthe United Nations in New York City.  The Washington, \nD.C. mission had fourteen employees between 2002 and \n2004, including two employees of the PA, although not all \nat the same time.3  The Washington, D.C. and New York \nmissions engaged in diplomatic activities during the rele-\nvant period.  The Washington, D.C. mission \u201chad a sub-\nstantial commercial presence in the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *4.  It used dozens of tele-\nphone numbers, purchased office supplies, paid for certain \nliving expenses for Hassan Abdel Rahman, the chief PLO \n \n3  The district court concluded that \u201cthe weight of the evidence indi-\ncates that the D.C. office simultaneously served as an office for the \nPLO and the PA.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *3. \n\n143a \n \n \nand PA representative in the United States, and engaged \nin other transactions.  Id.  The PLO also retained a con-\nsulting and lobbying firm through a multi-year, multi-mil-\nlion-dollar contract for services from about 1999 to 2004.  \nId.  The Washington, D.C. mission also promoted the Pal-\nestinian cause in speeches and media appearances. Id.   \nCourts have repeatedly held that neither the PA nor \nthe PLO is a \u201cstate\u201d under United States or international \nlaw.  See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 937 F.2d 44, \n47-48 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding the PLO, which had no de-\nfined territory or permanent population and did not have \ncapacity to enter into genuine formal relations with other \nnations, was not a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of the Foreign Sov-\nereign Immunities Act); Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian \nAuth., 315 F. Supp. 2d 164, 178-86 (D.R.I. 2004) (holding \nthat neither the PA nor the PLO is a state entitled to sov-\nereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct because neither entity has a defined territory with a \npermanent population controlled by a government that \nhas the capacity to enter into foreign relations); see also \nKnox v.  Palestine Liberation Org., 306 F. Supp. 2d 424, \n431 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (holding that neither the PLO nor the \nPA was a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act). \nWhile the United States does not recognize Palestine \nor the PA as a sovereign government, see Sokolow v. Pal-\nestine  Liberation Org., 583 F. Supp. 2d 451, 457-58 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2008) (\u201cPalestine, whose statehood is not recog-\nnized by the United States, does not meet the definition of \na \u2018state,\u2019 under United States and international law . . . .\u201d) \n(collecting cases), the PA is the governing authority in Pal-\nestine and employs tens of thousands of security personnel \nin Palestine.  According to the PA\u2019s Minister of Finance, \nthe \u201cPA funds conventional government services, includ-\ning developing infrastructure; public safety and the judi-\ncial system; health care; public schools and education; \n\n144a \n \n \nforeign affairs; economic development initiatives in agri-\nculture, energy, public works, and public housing; the pay-\nment of more than 155,000 government employee salaries \nand related pension funds; transportation; and, communi-\ncations and information technology services.\u201d \nB. \nThe plaintiffs sued the defendants in 2004, alleging vi-\nolations of the ATA for seven terror attacks committed \nduring a wave of violence known as \u201cthe al Aqsa Intifada,\u201d \nby nonparties who the plaintiffs alleged were affiliated \nwith the defendants.  The jury found the plaintiffs liable \nfor six of the attacks.4 At trial, the plaintiffs presented ev-\nidence of the following attacks. \ni. January 22, 2002: Jaffa Road Shooting \nOn January 22, 2002, a PA police officer opened fire \non a pedestrian mall in Jerusalem.  He shot \u201cindiscrimi-\nnately at the people who were on Jaffa Street,\u201d at a nearby \nbus stop and aboard a bus that was at the stop, and at peo-\nple in the stores nearby \u201cwith the aim of causing the death \nof as many people as possible.\u201d  The shooter killed two in-\ndividuals and wounded forty-five others before he was \nkilled by police.  The attack was carried out, according to \ntrial evidence, by six members of the PA police force who \nplanned the shooting.  Two of the plaintiffs were injured. \nii. January 27, 2002: Jaffa Road Bombing \nOn January 27, 2002, a PA intelligence informant \nnamed Wafa Idris detonated a suicide bomb on Jaffa Road \nin Jerusalem, killing herself and an Israeli man and \n \n4  The district court found claims relating to an attack on January 8, \n2001 that wounded Oz Guetta speculative and did not allow those \nclaims to proceed to the jury. The plaintiffs argue that this Court \nshould reinstate the Guetta claims. Because we conclude that there is \nno personal jurisdiction over the defendants for the ATA claims, it is \nunnecessary to reach this issue. \n\n145a \n \n \nseriously wounding four of the plaintiffs, including two \nchildren.  Evidence presented at trial showed that the \nbombing was planned by a PA intelligence officer who en-\ncouraged the assailant to conduct the suicide bombing, \neven after the assailant had doubts about doing so. \niii. March 21, 2002: King George Street Bombing \nOn March 21, 2002, Mohammed Hashaika, a former \nPA police officer, detonated a suicide bomb on King \nGeorge Street in Jerusalem.  Hashaika\u2019s co-conspirators \nchose the location because it was \u201cfull of people during the \nafternoon.\u201d  Hashaika set-off the explosion while in a \ncrowd \u201cwith the aim of causing the deaths of as many civil-\nians as possible.\u201d  Two plaintiffs were grievously wounded, \nincluding a seven-year-old American boy.  Evidence pre-\nsented at trial showed that a PA intelligence officer named \nAbdel Karim Aweis orchestrated the attack. \niv. June 19, 2002: French Hill Bombing \nOn June 19, 2002, a seventeen-year-old Palestinian \nman named Sa\u2019id Awada detonated a suicide bomb at a bus \nstop in the French Hill neighborhood of Jerusalem.  \nAwada was a member of a militant faction of the PLO\u2019s \nFatah party called the Al Aqsa Martyr Brigades \n(\u201cAAMB\u201d), which the United States Department of State \nhad designated as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d \n(\u201cFTO\u201d).  The bombing killed several people and wounded \ndozens, including an eighteen-year-old plaintiff who was \nstepping off a bus when the bomb exploded. \nv. July 31, 2002: Hebrew University Bombing \nOn July 31, 2002, military operatives of Hamas---a \nUnited States-designated FTO---detonated a bomb hid-\nden in a black cloth bag that was packed with hardware \nnuts in a caf\u00e9 at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  The ex-\nplosion killed nine, including four United States citizens, \nwhose estates bring suit here.  \n\n146a \n \n \nvi. January 29, 2004: Bus No. 19 Bombing \nOn January 29, 2004, in an AAMB attack, a PA police \nofficer named Ali Al-Ja\u2019ara detonated a suicide vest on a \ncrowded bus, Bus No. 19 traveling from Malha Mall to-\nward Paris Square in central Jerusalem.  The suicide \nbombing killed eleven people, including one of the plain-\ntiffs.  The bomber\u2019s aim, according to evidence submitted \nat trial, was to \u201ccaus[e] the deaths of a large number of \nindividuals.\u201d \nC. \nIn 2004, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Southern Dis-\ntrict of New York.  The defendants first moved to dismiss \nthe claims for lack of personal jurisdiction in July 2007.  \nThe district court denied the motion, subject to renewal \nafter jurisdictional discovery.  After the close of jurisdic-\ntional discovery, the district court denied the defendants\u2019 \nrenewed motion, holding that the court had general per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendants.  See Sokolow, 2011 \nWL 1345086, at *7. \nThe district court concluded, as an initial matter, that \nthe service of process was properly effected by serving the \nChief Representative of the PLO and the PA, Hassan Ab-\ndel Rahman, at his home in Virginia, pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 4(h)(1)(B) (providing that a for-\neign association \u201cmust be served[ ] . . . in a judicial district \nof the United States . . . by delivering a copy of the sum-\nmons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or \ngeneral agent . . . .\u201d); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a) (provid-\ning for nationwide service of process and venue under the \nATA); Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2. \nThe district court then engaged in a two-part analysis \nto determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \ncomported with the due process protections of the United \nStates Constitution.  First, it determined whether the de-\nfendants had sufficient minimum contacts with the forum \n\n147a \n \n \nsuch that the maintenance of the action did not offend tra-\nditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.  \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2 (citing Frontera Res. \nAzerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan Republic, \n582 F.3d 393, 396 (2d Cir. 2009)). \nThe district court distinguished between specific and \ngeneral personal jurisdiction---specific jurisdiction applies \nwhere the defendants\u2019 contacts are related to the litigation \nand general jurisdiction applies where the defendants\u2019 \ncontacts are so substantial that the defendants could be \nsued on all claims, even those unrelated to contacts with \nthe forum---and found that the district court had general \njurisdiction over the defendants.  Id. at *3.  The court con-\nsidered what it deemed the defendants\u2019 \u201csubstantial com-\nmercial presence in the United States,\u201d in particular \u201ca \nfully and continuously functional office in Washington, \nD.C.,\u201d bank accounts and commercial contracts, and \u201ca \nsubstantial promotional presence in the United States, \nwith the D.C. office having been permanently dedicated to \npromoting the interests of the PLO and the PA.\u201d  Id. at *4. \nThe district court concluded that activities involving \nthe defendants\u2019 New York office were exempt from juris-\ndictional analysis under an exception for United Nations\u2019 \nrelated activity articulated in Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51-\n52 (UN participation not properly considered basis for ju-\nrisdiction); see Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *5.  The dis-\ntrict court held that the activities involving the Washing-\nton, D.C. mission were not exempt from analysis and pro-\nvided \u201ca sufficient basis to exercise general jurisdiction \nover the Defendants.\u201d  Id. at *6 (\u201cThe PLO and the PA \nwere continuously and systematically present in the \nUnited States by virtue of their extensive public relations \nactivities.\u201d). \nNext, the district court considered \u201c\u2018whether the as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction comports with \u201ctraditional \n\n148a \n \n \nnotions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d---that is, \nwhether it is reasonable under the circumstances of the \nparticular case.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Rob-\nertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 568 (2d Cir. 1996)).  The \ncourt found that the exercise of jurisdiction did not offend \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\u201d \npursuant to the standard articulated by International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945), and its \nprogeny.  See Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *6-7.  The dis-\ntrict court concluded that \u201c[t]here is a strong inherent in-\nterest of the United States and Plaintiffs in litigating ATA \nclaims in the United States,\u201d and that the defendants \n\u201cfailed to identify an alternative forum where Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims could be brought, and where the foreign court could \ngrant a substantially similar remedy.\u201d  Id. at *7. \nIn January 2014, after the Supreme Court had signif-\nicantly narrowed the general personal jurisdiction test in \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. 746, the defendants moved for recon-\nsideration of the denial of their motion to dismiss. \nOn April 11, 2014, the district court denied the defend-\nants\u2019 motions for reconsideration, ruling that Daimler did \nnot compel dismissal.  The district court also denied the \ndefendants\u2019 motions to certify the jurisdictional issue for \nan interlocutory appeal.  See Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, \nat *1.  The defendants renewed their jurisdictional argu-\nment in their motions for summary judgment, arguing \nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Gucci America, Inc. v. Weix-\ning Li, 768 F.3d 122 (2d Cir. 2014), altered the controlling \nprecedent in this Circuit, requiring dismissal of the case.  \nSee Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *1.  The district court \nconcluded that it still had general personal jurisdiction \nover the defendants, describing the action as presenting \n\u201c\u2018an exceptional case,\u2019\u201d id. at *2, of the kind discussed in \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19, and Gucci, 768 F.3d at 135. \n\n149a \n \n \nThe district court held that \u201c[u]nder both Daimler \nand Gucci, the PA and PLO\u2019s continuous and systematic \nbusiness and commercial contacts within the United \nStates are sufficient to support the exercise of general ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d and that the record before the court was \u201cin-\nsufficient to conclude that either defendant is \u2018at home\u2019 in \na particular jurisdiction other than the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *2. \nFollowing the summary judgment ruling, the defend-\nants sought mandamus on the personal jurisdiction issue.  \nThis Court denied the defendants\u2019 petition.  See In re Pal-\nestine Liberation Org., Palestinian Authority, No. 14-\n4449 (2d Cir. Jan. 6, 2015) (summary order). \nThe case proceeded to trial in January 2015.  During \nthe trial, the defendants introduced evidence about the \nPA\u2019s and PLO\u2019s home in Palestine.  The trial evidence \nshowed that the terrorist attacks occurred in the vicinity \nof Jerusalem.  The plaintiffs did not allege or submit evi-\ndence that the plaintiffs were targeted in any of the six at-\ntacks at issue because of their United States citizenship or \nthat the defendants engaged in conduct in the United \nStates related to the attacks. \nAt the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case in chief, the de-\nfendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), arguing, among \nother grounds, that the district court lacked personal ju-\nrisdiction over the defendants.  The Court denied the mo-\ntion.  The defendants renewed that motion at the close of \nall the evidence and again asserted that the court lacked \npersonal jurisdiction. \nDuring and immediately after trial, the District Court \nfor the District of Columbia issued three separate deci-\nsions dismissing similar suits for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion by similar plaintiffs in cases against the PA and the \nPLO.  See Estate of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 82 F. \n\n150a \n \n \nSupp. 3d 237, 245\u00ac46 (D.D.C. 2015), appeal docketed, No. \n15-7034 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 8, 2015); Livnat v. Palestinian \nAuth., 82 F. Supp. 3d 19, 30 (D.D.C. 2015), appeal dock-\neted, No. 15-7024 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2015); Safra v. Pales-\ntinian Auth., 82 F. Supp. 3d 37, 47-48 (D.D.C. 2015), ap-\npeal docketed, No. 15-7025 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 18, 2015). \nIn light of these cases, on May 1, 2015, the defendants \nrenewed their motion to dismiss for lack of both general \nand specific personal jurisdiction.  The defendants also \nmoved, in the alternative, for judgment as a matter of law \nor for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure 50(b) and 59.  The district court reviewed the deci-\nsions by the District Court for the District of Columbia, \nbut, for the reasons articulated in its 2014 decision and at \noral argument, concluded that the district court had gen-\neral personal jurisdiction over the defendants.  The dis-\ntrict court did not rule explicitly on whether it had specific \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants. \nThe jury found the defendants liable for all six attacks \nand awarded the plaintiffs damages of $218.5 million, an \namount that was trebled automatically pursuant to the \nATA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a), bringing the total award to \n$655.5 million. \nThe parties engaged in post-trial motion practice not \nrelevant here, the defendants timely appealed, and the \nplaintiffs cross-appealed. \nII. \nA. \n\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s assertion of personal ju-\nrisdiction de novo.\u201d  Dynegy Midstream Servs. v. Tram-\nmochem, 451 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 2006).5  \n \n5  The standard of review in this case is complicated because the is-\nsue of personal jurisdiction was raised initially on a motion to dismiss, \nboth before and after discovery, and as a basis for Rule 50 motions at \n\n151a \n \n \nTo exercise personal jurisdiction lawfully, three re-\nquirements must be met.  \u201cFirst, the plaintiff\u2019s service of \nprocess upon the defendant must have been procedurally \nproper.

Third, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nmust comport with constitutional due process principles.\u201d  \nLicci  ex rel. Licci v.

Personal \njurisdiction is \u201ca matter of individual liberty\u201d because due \nprocess protects the individual\u2019s right to be subject only to \nlawful power.  J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion) (quoting Ins. Corp. \nof Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n702 (1982)). \nThe ATA provides that process \u201cmay be served in any \ndistrict where the defendant resides, is found, or has an \n \nthe conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case and after all the evidence was pre-\nsented. This Court typically reviews factual findings in a district \ncourt\u2019s decision on personal jurisdiction for clear error and its legal \nconclusions de novo. See Frontera Res., 582 F.3d at 395. In this case, \nthe parties agree that this Court should review de novo whether the \ndistrict court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction was constitutional. See \nPls.\u2019 Br. at 27; Defs.\u2019 Br. at 23. In any event, the issues relating to \ngeneral jurisdiction are essentially legal questions that should be re-\nviewed de novo. Assuming without deciding the question, we review \nthe district court\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction de novo. \n\n152a \n \n \nagent . . . . \u201d 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2334(a).  The district court found \nthat the plaintiffs properly served the defendants because \nthey served the complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 4(h)(1)(B) (providing that service on an \nunincorporated association is proper if the complaint is \nserved on a \u201cgeneral agent\u201d of the entity), on Hassan Ab-\ndel Rahman, who \u201cbased upon the overwhelming compe-\ntent evidence produced by Plaintiffs, was the Chief Rep-\nresentative of the PLO and the PA in the United States at \nthe time of service.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *2.6 \nThe defendants have not disputed that service was \nproper and that there was a statutory basis pursuant to \nthe ATA for that service of process.  Therefore, the only \nquestion before the Court is whether the third jurisdic-\ntional requirement is met---whether jurisdiction over the \ndefendants may be exercised consistent with the Consti-\ntution. \nB. \nBefore we reach the analysis of constitutional due pro-\ncess, the plaintiffs raise three threshold issues: First, \nwhether the defendants waived their objections to per-\nsonal jurisdiction; second, whether the defendants have \ndue process rights at all; and third, whether the due pro-\ncess clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution \nand not the Fourteenth Amendment controls the personal \njurisdiction analysis in this case. \nFirst, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants waived \ntheir argument that the district court lacked personal ju-\nrisdiction over them.  The plaintiffs contend that the de-\nfendants could have argued that they were not subject to \ngeneral jurisdiction under the \u201cat home\u201d test before \n \n6  The district court found that the defendants are \u201cunincorporated \nassociations.\u201d  See Sokolow v. Palestine  Liberation Org., 60 F. Supp. \n3d 509, 523-24 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). \n\n153a \n \n \nDaimler was decided because the \u201cat home\u201d general juris-\ndiction test existed after Goodyear Dunlop Tire Opera-\ntions, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 (2011).  This argument \nis unavailing because this Court in Gucci looked to the test \nin Daimler as the appropriate test for general jurisdiction \nover a corporate entity.  See Gucci, 768 F.3d at 135-36.  \nThe defendants did not waive or forfeit their objection to \npersonal jurisdiction because they repeatedly and consist-\nently objected to personal jurisdiction and invoked Daim-\nler after this Court\u2019s decision in Gucci.  Furthermore, the \ndistrict court explicitly noted that the \u201cDefendants\u2019 mo-\ntions asserting lack of personal jurisdiction are not denied \nbased on a theory of waiver.\u201d  Sokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, \nat *2 n.2 (emphasis added). \nSecond, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants have \nno due process rights because the defendants are foreign \ngovernments and share many of the attributes typically \nassociated with a sovereign government.  Foreign sover-\neign states do not have due process rights but receive the \nprotection of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.  See \nFrontera Res., 582 F.3d at 396-400.  The plaintiffs argue \nthat entities, like the defendants, lack due process rights, \nbecause they do not view themselves as part of a sovereign \nand are treated as a foreign government in other contexts.  \nThe plaintiffs do not cite any cases indicating that a non-\nsovereign entity with governmental attributes lacks due \nprocess rights.  All the cases cited by the plaintiffs stand \nfor the proposition that sovereign governments lack due \nprocess rights, and these cases have not been extended be-\nyond the scope of entities that are separate sovereigns, \nrecognized by the United States government as sover-\neigns, and therefore enjoy foreign sovereign immunity. \nWhile sovereign states are not entitled to due process \nprotection, see id. at 399, neither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state, and \nthe executive\u2019s determination of such a matter is \n\n154a \n \n \nconclusive.  See Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2088 \n(2015); see also Ungar, 315 F. Supp. 2d at 177 (\u201cThe PA \nand PLO\u2019s argument must fail because Palestine does not \nsatisfy the four criteria for statehood and is not a State \nunder prevailing international legal standards.\u201d); Knox, \n306 F. Supp. 2d at 431 (\u201c[T]here does not exist a state of \nPalestine which meets the legal criteria for statehood. . . \n.\u201d); accord Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 47 (\u201cIt is quite clear \nthat the PLO meets none of those requirements [for a \nstate].\u201d).  Because neither defendant is a state, the defend-\nants have due process rights.  See O\u2019Neill v. Asat Trust \nReg. (In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001), 714 F.3d \n659, 681-82 (2d Cir. 2013) (\u201cO\u2019Neill\u201d) (dismissing for lack \nof personal jurisdiction claims against charities, financial \ninstitutions, and other individuals who are alleged to have \nprovided support to Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda); Liv-\nnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 26 (due process clause applies to the \nPA (collecting cases)). \nThird, the plaintiffs and amici curiae Former Federal \nOfficials argue that the restrictive Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards cannot be imported into the \nFifth Amendment and that the due process clause of the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution,7 and not the Four-\nteenth Amendment,8 applies to the ATA and controls the \nanalysis in this case.  The argument is particularly im-\nportant in this case because the defendants rely on the \nstandard for personal jurisdiction set out in Daimler and \nthe Daimler Court explained that it was interpreting the \n \n7  The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part: \u201c. . . nor shall any \nperson . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law . . . .\u201d  U.S. CONST. amend. V. \n8  The Fourteenth Amendment states in relevant part: \u201c. . . nor shall \nany State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law . . . .\u201d  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV., \u00a7 1. \n\n155a \n \n \ndue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Daim-\nler, 134 S. Ct. at 751. \nThe plaintiffs and amici argue that the Fourteenth \nAmendment due process clause restricts state power but \nthe Fifth Amendment should be applied to the exercise of \nfederal power.  Their argument is that the Fourteenth \nAmendment imposes stricter limits on the personal juris-\ndiction that courts can exercise because that Amendment, \ngrounded in concepts of federalism, was intended to ref-\neree jurisdictional conflicts among the sovereign States.  \nThe Fifth Amendment, by contrast, imposes more lenient \nrestrictions because it contemplates disputes with foreign \nnations, which, unlike States, do not follow reciprocal rules \nand are not subject to our constitutional system.  See, e.g., \nJ. McIntyre Mach., 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion) \n(\u201cBecause the United States is a distinct sovereign, a de-\nfendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of \nthe courts of the United States but not of any particular \nState.  This is consistent with the premises and unique ge-\nnius of our Constitution.\u201d).  To conflate the due process re-\nquirements of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments, the \nplaintiffs and amici argue, would impose a unilateral con-\nstraint on United States courts, even when the political \nbranches conclude that personal jurisdiction over a de-\nfendant for extraterritorial conduct is in the national in-\nterest.9  \n \n9  The plaintiffs also point to the brief filed by the United States So-\nlicitor General in Daimler to support their argument that the due pro-\ncess standards for the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments vary. How-\never, the United States never advocated that the Fourteenth Amend-\nment standard would be inapplicable to Fifth Amendment cases and, \ninstead, urged the Court not to reach the issue. See Brief for the \nUnited States as Amicus Curaie Supporting Petitioner, Daim-\nlerChrysler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014) (No. 11-965), 2013 \nWL 3377321, at *3 n.1 (\u201cThis Court has consistently reserved the \nquestion whether its Fourteenth Amendment personal jurisdiction \n\n156a \n \n \nThis Court\u2019s precedents clearly establish the congru-\nence of due process analysis under both the Fourteenth \nand Fifth Amendments.  This Court has explained: \u201c[T]he \ndue process analysis [for purposes of the court\u2019s in perso-\nnam jurisdiction] is basically the same under both the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The principal differ-\nence is that under the Fifth Amendment the court can con-\nsider the defendant\u2019s contacts throughout the United \nStates, while under the Fourteenth Amendment only the \ncontacts with the forum state may be considered.\u201d  Chew \nv. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998). \nIndeed, this Court has already applied Fourteenth \nAmendment principles to Fifth Amendment civil terror-\nism cases.  For example, in O\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 673-74, this \nCourt applied Fourteenth Amendment due process cases \nto terrorism claims brought pursuant to the ATA in fed-\neral court.  See In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, \n538 F.3d 71, 93 (2d Cir. 2008), abrogated on other grounds \nby Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305 (2010); see also Tex. \nTrading & Milling Corp. v. Fed.  Republic of Nigeria, 647 \nF.2d 300, 315 n.37 (2d Cir. 1981) (declining to apply differ-\nent due-process standards in a case governed by the Fifth \nAmendment compared to one governed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment), overruled on other grounds by Frontera  \nRes., 582 F.3d at 400; GSS Grp. Ltd v. Nat\u2019l Port Auth., \n680 F.3d 805, 816-17 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (applying Fourteenth \nAmendment case law when considering minimum contacts \nunder the Fifth Amendment). \nAmici Federal Officials concede that our precedents \nsettle the issue, but they argue those cases were wrongly \n \nprecedents would apply in a case governed by the Fifth Amendment, \nand it should do so here.\u201d). \n\n157a \n \n \ndecided and urge us not to follow them.  We decline the \ninvitation to upend settled law.10 \nAccordingly, we conclude that the minimum contacts \nand fairness analysis is the same under the Fifth Amend-\nment and the Fourteenth Amendment in civil cases and \nproceed to analyze the jurisdictional question. \nIII. \nPursuant to the due process clauses of the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments, there are two parts to the due \nprocess test for personal jurisdiction as established by In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. 310, and its progeny: the \u201cmin-\nimum contacts\u201d inquiry and the \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry.  \nSee Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodri-\nguez, 305 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.).  The \nminimum contacts inquiry requires that the court deter-\nmine whether a defendant has sufficient minimum con-\ntacts with the forum to justify the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendant.  See Daimler, 134 S. \nCt. at 754; Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 788 (1984); Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316; Metro. Life Ins., 84 F.3d at 567-68.  \nThe reasonableness inquiry requires the court to deter-\nmine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction over \nthe defendant comports with \u201c\u2018traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice\u2019\u201d under the circumstances of \nthe particular case.  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 754 (quoting \nGoodyear, 564 U.S. at 923); Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U.S. 462, 476-78 (1985). \nInternational Shoe distinguished between two exer-\ncises of personal jurisdiction: general jurisdiction and \n \n10  Amici argue for \u201cuniversal\u201d---or limitless---personal jurisdiction \nin terrorism cases. This Court has already rejected that suggestion. \nSee United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 107-08 (2d Cir. 2003) (per \ncuriam) (\u201c[T]errorism---unlike piracy, war crimes, and crimes against \nhumanity---does not provide a basis for universal jurisdiction.\u201d). \n\n158a \n \n \nspecific jurisdiction.  The district court in this case ruled \nonly on the issue of general jurisdiction.  We conclude that \ngeneral jurisdiction is absent; the question remains \nwhether the court may nonetheless assert its jurisdiction \nunder the doctrine of specific jurisdiction. \nA court may assert general personal jurisdiction over \na foreign defendant to hear any and all claims against that \ndefendant only when the defendant\u2019s affiliations with the \nState in which suit is brought \u201care so constant and perva-\nsive \u2018as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum \nState.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 751 (quoting Goodyear, 564 \nU.S. at 919); see also Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924.  \u201cSince \nInternational Shoe, \u2018specific jurisdiction has become the \ncenterpiece of modern jurisdiction theory, while general \njurisdiction [has played] a reduced rule.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. \nCt. at 755 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 925).  Accord-\ningly, there are \u201cfew\u201d Supreme Court opinions over the \npast half-century that deal with general jurisdiction.  Id. \n\u201cSpecific jurisdiction, on the other hand, depends on \nan affiliation between the forum and the underlying con-\ntroversy, principally, activity or an occurrence that takes \nplace in the forum State and is therefore subject to the \nState\u2019s regulation.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919 (altera-\ntions, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).  The \nexercise of specific jurisdiction depends on in-state activ-\nity that \u201cgave rise to the episode-in-suit.\u201d  Id. at 923 (quot-\ning Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 317) (emphasis in original).  In \ncertain circumstances, the \u201ccommission of certain \u2018single \nor occasional acts\u2019 in a State may be sufficient to render a \ncorporation answerable in that State with respect to those \nacts, though not with respect to matters unrelated to the \nforum connections.\u201d  Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at \n318). \n\n159a \n \n \nA. \nThe district court concluded that it had general juris-\ndiction over the defendants; however, that conclusion re-\nlies on a misreading of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in \nDaimler. \nIn Daimler, the plaintiffs asserted claims under the \nAlien Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act \nof 1991, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1350 & note, as well as other \nclaims, arising from alleged torture that was committed in \nArgentina by the Argentinian government with the collab-\noration of an Argentina-based subsidiary of the German \ncorporate defendant.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 750-52.  \nThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Cali-\nfornia federal court could exercise general personal juris-\ndiction over the German corporation based on the contin-\nuous activities in California of the German corporation\u2019s \nindirect United States subsidiary.  See id. at 751.  Daimler \nconcluded that the German corporate parent, which was \nnot incorporated in California and did not have its princi-\npal place of business in California, could not be considered \nto be \u201cat home in California\u201d and subject to general juris-\ndiction there.  Id. at 762. \nDaimler analogized its \u201cat-home test\u201d to that of an in-\ndividual\u2019s domicile.  \u201c[F]or a corporation, it is an equiva-\nlent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded \nas at home.  With respect to a corporation, the place of in-\ncorporation and principal place of business are paradigm \nbases for general jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 760 (alterations, in-\nternal quotation marks, and citations omitted). \nAs an initial matter, while Daimler involved corpora-\ntions, and neither the PA nor the PLO is a corporation---\nthe PA is a non-sovereign government and the PLO is a \nforeign agent, and both are unincorporated associations, \nsee Part I.A---Daimler\u2019s reasoning was based on an anal-\nogy to general jurisdiction over individuals, and there is no \n\n160a \n \n \nreason to invent a different test for general personal juris-\ndiction depending on whether the defendant is an individ-\nual, a corporation, or another entity.  Indeed, in Gucci this \nCourt relied on Daimler when it found there was no gen-\neral personal jurisdiction over the Bank of China, a non-\nparty bank that was incorporated and headquartered in \nChina and owned by the Chinese government.  The Court \ndescribed the Daimler test as applicable to \u201centities.\u201d  \n\u201cGeneral, all-purpose jurisdiction permits a court to hear \n\u2018any and all claims\u2019 against an entity.\u201d  Gucci, 768 F.3d at \n134 (emphasis added); see id. at 134 n.13 (\u201cThe essence of \ngeneral personal jurisdiction is the ability to entertain \u2018any \nand all claims\u2019 against an entity based solely on the entity\u2019s \nactivities in the forum, rather than on the particulars of \nthe case before the court.\u201d).  Consequently, we consider \nthe PLO and the PA entities subject to the Daimler test \nfor general jurisdiction.  See Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at \n245-46; Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 28; Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d \nat 46. \nPursuant to Daimler, the question becomes, where \nare the PA and PLO \u201c\u2018fairly regarded as at home\u2019\u201d? 134 S. \nCt. at 761 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 924).  The over-\nwhelming evidence shows that the defendants are \u201cat \nhome\u201d in Palestine, where they govern.  Palestine is the \ncentral seat of government for the PA and PLO.  The PA\u2019s \nauthority is limited to the West Bank and Gaza, and it has \nno independently operated offices anywhere else.  All PA \ngovernmental ministries, the Palestinian president, the \nParliament, and the Palestinian security services reside in \nPalestine. \nAs the District Court for the District of Columbia ob-\nserved, \u201c[i]t is common sense that the single ascertainable \nplace where a government such a[s] the Palestinian Au-\nthority should be amenable to suit for all purposes is the \nplace where it governs.  Here, that place is the West Bank, \nnot the United States.\u201d  Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 30; see \n\n161a \n \n \nalso Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 48.  The same analysis applies \nequally to the PLO, which during the relevant period \nmaintained its headquarters in Palestine and Amman, Jor-\ndan.  See Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 245 (\u201cDefendants\u2019 \nalleged contacts . . . do not suffice to render the PA and the \nPLO \u2018essentially at home\u2019 in the United States.\u201d) \nThe activities of the defendants\u2019 mission in Washing-\nton, D.C.---which the district court concluded simultane-\nously served as an office for the PLO and the PA, see \nSokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *3---were limited to main-\ntaining an office in Washington, promoting the Palestinian \ncause in speeches and media appearances, and retaining a \nlobbying firm.  See id. at *4. \nThese contacts with the United States do not render \nthe PA and the PLO \u201cessentially at home\u201d in the United \nStates.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 754.  The commercial \ncontacts that the district court found supported general \njurisdiction are like those rejected as insufficient by the \nSupreme Court in Daimler.  In Daimler, the Supreme \nCourt held as \u201cunacceptably grasping\u201d a formulation that \nallowed for \u201cthe exercise of general jurisdiction in every \nState in which a corporation \u2018engages in a substantial, con-\ntinuous, and systematic course of business.\u2019\u201d  134 S. Ct. at \n761.  The Supreme Court found that a court in California \ncould not exercise general personal jurisdiction over the \nGerman parent company even though that company\u2019s in-\ndirect subsidiary was the largest supplier of luxury vehi-\ncles to the California market.  Id. at 752.  The Supreme \nCourt deemed Daimler\u2019s contacts with California \u201cslim\u201d \nand concluded that they would \u201chardly render it at home\u201d \nin California.  Id. at 760. \nDaimler\u2019s contacts with California were substantially \ngreater than the defendants\u2019 contacts with the United \nStates in this case.  But still the Supreme Court rejected \nthe proposition that Daimler should be subjected to \n\n162a \n \n \ngeneral personal jurisdiction in California for events that \noccurred anywhere in the world.  Such a regime would al-\nlow entities to be sued in many jurisdictions, not just the \njurisdictions where the entities were centered, for world-\nwide events unrelated to the jurisdiction where suit was \nbrought.  The Supreme Court found such a conception of \ngeneral personal jurisdiction to be incompatible with due \nprocess.  The Supreme Court explained: \nGeneral jurisdiction . . . calls for an appraisal of a cor-\nporation\u2019s activities in their entirety, nationwide and \nworldwide.  A corporation that operates in many \nplaces can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.  \nOtherwise, \u201cat home\u201d would be synonymous with \u201cdo-\ning business\u201d tests framed before specific jurisdiction \nevolved in the United States.  Nothing in Interna-\ntional Shoe and its progeny suggests that \u201ca particu-\nlar quantum of local activity\u201d should give a State au-\nthority over a \u201cfar larger quantum of . . . activity\u201d hav-\ning no connection to any in-state activity. \nId. at 762 n.20 (internal citations omitted).  Regardless of \nthe commercial contacts occasioned by the defendants\u2019 \nWashington, D.C. mission, there is no doubt that the \u201cfar \nlarger quantum\u201d of the defendants\u2019 activities took place in \nPalestine. \nThe district court held that the record before it was \n\u201cinsufficient to conclude that either defendant is \u2018at home\u2019 \nin a particular jurisdiction other than the United States.\u201d  \nSokolow, 2014 WL 6811395, at *2.  That conclusion is not \nsupported by the record.  The evidence demonstrates that \nthe defendants are \u201cat home\u201d in Palestine, where these \n\n163a \n \n \nentities are headquartered and from where they are di-\nrected.  See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20.11 \nThe district court also erred in placing the burden on \nthe defendants to prove that there exists \u201can alternative \nforum where Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could be brought, and \nwhere the foreign court could grant a substantially similar \nremedy.\u201d  Sokolow, 2011 WL 1345086, at *7.  Daimler im-\nposes no such burden.  In fact, it is the plaintiff\u2019s burden \nto establish that the court has personal jurisdiction over \nthe defendants.  See Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda Ltd., 101 \nF.3d 863, 865 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201c[T]he plaintiff bears the ul-\ntimate burden of establishing jurisdiction over the defend-\nant by a preponderance of evidence . . . .\u201d); Metro.

Supp. 3d \nat 49.12  \nFinally, the district court did not dispute the defend-\nants\u2019 ties to Palestine but concluded that the court had \ngeneral jurisdiction pursuant to an \u201cexception\u201d that the \nSupreme Court alluded to in a footnote in Daimler.  In \nDaimler, the Supreme Court did not \u201cforeclose the possi-\nbility that in an exceptional case, a corporation\u2019s opera-\ntions in a forum other than its formal place of \n \n11  It appears that the district court, when considering where the de-\nfendants were \u201cat home,\u201d limited its inquiry to areas that are within a \nsovereign nation. We see no basis in precedent for this limitation. \n12  The district court\u2019s focus on the importance of identifying an al-\nternative forum may have been borrowed inappositely from forum \nnon conveniens jurisprudence, pursuant to which a court considers (1) \nthe degree of deference to be afforded to the plaintiff\u2019s choice of fo-\nrum; (2) whether there is an adequate alternative forum for adjudicat-\ning the dispute; and (3) whether the balance of private and public in-\nterests tips in favor of adjudication in one forum or the other. See \nNorex Petroleum  Ltd. v. Access Indus., Inc., 416 F.3d 146, 153 (2d \nCir. 2005). However, that is not the test for general jurisdiction under \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 762 n.20. \n\n164a \n \n \nincorporation or principal place of business may be so sub-\nstantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation \nat home in that State.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19 (citing Per-\nkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.S. 437, 447-48 \n(1952)). \nDaimler analyzed the 1952 Perkins case, \u201c\u2018the text-\nbook case of general jurisdiction appropriately exercised \nover a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in \nthe forum.\u2019\u201d Id. at 755-56 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at \n928).  The defendant in Perkins was a company, Benguet \nConsolidated Mining Company (\u201cBenguet\u201d), which was in-\ncorporated under the laws of the Philippines, where it op-\nerated gold and silver mines.  During World War II, the \nJapanese occupied the Philippines, and Benguet\u2019s presi-\ndent relocated to Ohio, where he kept an office, maintained \nthe company\u2019s files, and oversaw the company\u2019s activities.  \nPerkins, 342 U.S. at 447-48.  The plaintiff, a nonresident \nof Ohio, sued Benguet in a state court in Ohio on a claim \nthat neither arose in Ohio nor related to the corporation\u2019s \nactivities in Ohio, but the Supreme Court nevertheless \nheld that the Ohio courts could constitutionally exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  Id. at \n438, 440.  As the Supreme Court later observed: \u201c\u2018Ohio was \nthe corporation\u2019s principal, if temporary, place of busi-\nness.\u2019\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 756 (quoting Keeton v. Hus-\ntler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 780 n.11 (1984)). \nSuch exceptional circumstances did not exist in Daim-\nler, id. at 761 n.19, or in Gucci.  In Gucci, this Court held \nthat, while a nonparty bank had branch offices in the fo-\nrum, it was not an \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which to exercise \ngeneral personal jurisdiction where the bank was incorpo-\nrated and headquartered elsewhere, and its contacts were \nnot \u201c\u2018so continuous and systematic as to render [it] essen-\ntially at home in the forum.\u2019\u201d 768 F.3d at 135 (quoting \nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19). \n\n165a \n \n \nThe defendants\u2019 activities in this case, as with those of \nthe defendants in Daimler and Gucci, \u201cplainly do not ap-\nproach\u201d the required level of contact to qualify as \u201cexcep-\ntional.\u201d  Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 & n.19.  The PLO and \nPA have not transported their principle \u201chome\u201d to the \nUnited States, even temporarily, as the defendant had in \nPerkins.  See Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d \n619, 628-30 (2d Cir. 2016). \nAccordingly, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \ndecision in Daimler, the district court could not properly \nexercise general personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants. \nB. \nThe district court did not rule explicitly on whether it \nhad specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants, but \nthe question was sufficiently briefed and argued to allow \nus to reach that issue. \n\u201cThe inquiry whether a forum State may assert spe-\ncific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant focuses on \nthe relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation.  For a State to exercise jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process, the defendant\u2019s suit-related conduct \nmust create a substantial connection with the forum \nState.\u201d  Walden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115, 1121 (2014) (in-\nternal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The rela-\ntionship between the defendant and the forum \u201cmust arise \nout of contacts that the \u2018defendant himself\u2019 creates with \nthe forum.\u201d  Id. at 1122 (citing Burger King, 471 U.S. at \n475) (emphasis in original).  The \u201c\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 anal-\nysis looks to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State \nitself, not the defendant\u2019s contacts with persons who re-\nside there.\u201d  Id.  And the \u201csame principles apply when in-\ntentional torts are involved.\u201d  Id. at 1123. \nThe question in this case is whether the defendants\u2019 \nsuit-related conduct\u2014their role in the six terror attacks at \n\n166a \n \n \nissue\u2014creates a substantial connection with the forum \nState pursuant to the ATA.  The relevant \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d by the defendants was the conduct that could \nhave subjected them to liability under the ATA.  On its \nface, the conduct in this case did not involve the defend-\nants\u2019 conduct in the United States in violation of the ATA.  \nWhile the plaintiff-victims were United States citizens, the \nterrorist attacks occurred in and around Jerusalem, and \nthe defendants\u2019 activities in violation of the ATA occurred \noutside the United States. \nThe ATA provides: \nAny national of the United States injured in his or her \nperson, property, or business by reason of an act of \ninternational terrorism, or his or her estate, survi-\nvors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any appropriate \ndistrict court of the United States and shall recover \nthreefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost \nof the suit, including attorney\u2019s fees. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a). \nTo prevail under the ATA, a plaintiff must prove \n\u201cthree formal elements: unlawful action, the requisite \nmental state, and causation.\u201d  Sokolow, 60 F. Supp. 3d at \n514 (quoting Gill v. Arab Bank, PLC, 893 F. Supp. 2d 542, \n553 (E.D.N.Y. 2012)) (emphasis in original). \nTo establish an \u201cunlawful action,\u201d the plaintiffs must \nshow that their injuries resulted from an act of \u201cinterna-\ntional terrorism.\u201d  The ATA defines \u201cinternational terror-\nism\u201d as activities that, among other things, \u201cinvolve violent \nacts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of \nthe criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or \nthat would be a criminal violation if committed within the \njurisdiction of the United States or of any State.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(A).  The acts must also appear to be in-\ntended \u201c(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) \nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \n\n167a \n \n \ncoercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by \nmass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(B)(i)-(iii). \nThe plaintiffs asserted that the defendants were re-\nsponsible on a respondeat superior theory for a variety of \npredicate acts, including murder and attempted murder, \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111, 2332, use of a destructive device on a \nmass transportation vehicle, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1992, detonating \nan explosive device on a public transportation system, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2332f, and conspiracy to commit those acts, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 371.  See Sokolow, 60 F. Supp. 3d at 515.  They \nalso asserted that the defendants directly violated federal \nand state antiterrorism laws, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B, \nby providing material support to FTO-designated groups \n(the AAMB and Hamas) and by harboring persons whom \nthe defendants knew or had reasonable grounds to believe \ncommitted or were about to commit an offense relating to \nterrorism, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339 et seq.; see also Sokolow, 60 \nF. Supp. 3d at 520-21, 523. \nThe ATA further limits international terrorism to ac-\ntivities that \u201coccur primarily outside the territorial juris-\ndiction of the United States, or transcend national bound-\naries in terms of the means by which they are accom-\nplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or \ncoerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or \nseek asylum.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(C) (emphasis added). \nThe bombings and shootings here occurred entirely \noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  \nThus, the question becomes: What other constitutionally \nsufficient connection did the commission of these torts by \nthese defendants have to this jurisdiction? \nThe jury found in a special verdict that the PA and the \nPLO were liable for the attacks under several theories.  In \nall of the attacks, the jury found that the PA and the PLO \nwere liable for providing material support or resources \n\n168a \n \n \nthat were used in preparation for, or in carrying out, each \nattack. \nIn addition, the jury found that in five of the attacks--\n-the January 22, 2002 Jaffa Road Shooting, the January \n27, 2002 Jaffa Road Bombing, the March 21, 2002 King \nGeorge Street Bombing, the July 31, 2002 Hebrew Uni-\nversity Bombing, and the January 29, 2004 Bus No. 19 \nBombing---the PA was liable because an employee of the \nPA, acting within the scope of the employee\u2019s employment \nand in furtherance of the activities of the PA, either car-\nried out, or knowingly provided material support or re-\nsources that were used in preparation for, or in carrying \nout, the attack. \nThe jury also found that in one of the attacks---the \nJuly 31, 2002 Hebrew University Bombing---the PLO and \nthe PA harbored or concealed a person who the organiza-\ntions knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe, commit-\nted or was about to commit the attack. \nFinally, the jury found that in three attacks---the June \n19, 2002 French Hill Bombing, the July 31, 2002 Hebrew \nUniversity Bombing, and the January 29, 2004 Bus No. 19 \nBombing---the PA and PLO knowingly provided material \nsupport to an FTO-designated group (the AAMB or Ha-\nmas). \nBut these actions, as heinous as they were, were not \nsufficiently connected to the United States to provide spe-\ncific personal jurisdiction in the United States.  There is \nno basis to conclude that the defendants participated in \nthese acts in the United States or that their liability for \nthese acts resulted from their actions that did occur in the \nUnited States. \nIn short, the defendants were liable for tortious activ-\nities that occurred outside the United States and affected \nUnited States citizens only because they were victims of \nindiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.  The \n\n169a \n \n \nresidence or citizenship of the plaintiffs is an insufficient \nbasis for specific jurisdiction over the defendants.  A focus \non the relationship of the defendants, the forum, and the \ndefendants\u2019 suit-related conduct points to the conclusion \nthat there is no specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants for the torts in this case.  See Walden, 134 S. Ct. \nat 1121; see also Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923. \nIn the absence of such a relationship, the plaintiffs ar-\ngue on appeal that the Court has specific jurisdiction for \nthree reasons.  First, the plaintiffs argue that, under the \n\u201ceffects test,\u201d a defendant acting entirely outside the \nUnited States is subject to jurisdiction \u201cif the defendant \nexpressly aimed its conduct\u201d at the United States.  Licci \nex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d \n161, 173 (2d Cir. 2013).  The plaintiffs point to the jury ver-\ndict that found that the defendants provided material sup-\nport to designated FTOs---the AAMB and Hamas---and \nthat the defendants\u2019 employees, acting within the scope of \ntheir employment, killed and injured United States citi-\nzens.  They also argue that the defendants\u2019 terror attacks \nwere intended to influence United States policy to favor \nthe defendants\u2019 political goals.  Second, the plaintiffs ar-\ngue that the defendants purposefully availed themselves \nof the forum by establishing a continuous presence in the \nUnited States and pressuring United States government \npolicy by conducting terror attacks in Israel and threaten-\ning further terrorism unless Israel withdrew from Gaza \nand the West Bank.  See Banks Brussels Lambert, 305 \nF.3d at 128.  Third, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants \nconsented to personal jurisdiction under the ATA by ap-\npointing an agent to accept process. \nWalden forecloses the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.  First, \nwith regard to the effects test, the defendant must \u201cex-\npressly aim[]\u201d his conduct at the United States.  See Licci, \n732 F. 3d at 173.  Pursuant to Walden, it is \u201cinsufficient to \nrely on a defendant\u2019s \u2018random, fortuitous, or attenuated \n\n170a \n \n \ncontacts\u2019 or on the \u2018unilateral activity\u2019 of a plaintiff\u201d with \nthe forum to establish specific jurisdiction.  Walden, 134 S. \nCt. at 1123 (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475).  While \nthe killings and related acts of terrorism are the kind of \nactivities that the ATA proscribes, those acts were uncon-\nnected to the forum and were not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.  And \u201c[a] forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdic-\ntion over an out-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be \nbased on intentional conduct by the defendant that creates \nthe necessary contacts with the forum.\u201d  Id.  That is not \nthe case here. \nThe plaintiffs argue that United States citizens were \ntargets of these attacks, but their own evidence estab-\nlishes the random and fortuitous nature of the terror at-\ntacks.  For example, at trial, the plaintiffs emphasized how \nthe \u201ckilling was indeed random\u201d and targeted \u201cChristians \nand Jews, Israelis, Americans, people from all over the \nworld.\u201d  J.A. 3836.  Evidence at trial showed that the \nshooters fired \u201cindiscriminately,\u201d J.A. 3944, and chose \nsites for their suicide bomb attacks that were \u201cfull of peo-\nple,\u201d J.A. 4030-31, because they sought to kill \u201cas many \npeople as possible,\u201d J.A. 3944; see also J.A. 4031. \nThe plaintiffs argue that \u201c[i]t is a fair inference that \nDefendants intended to hit American citizens by continu-\ning a terror campaign that continuously hit Americans . . . \n.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. at 37 (emphasis in original).  But the Constitu-\ntion requires much more purposefully directed contact \nwith the forum.  For example, the Supreme Court has \u201cup-\nheld the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants who \nhave purposefully \u2018reach[ed] out beyond\u2019 their State and \ninto another by, for example, entering a contractual rela-\ntionship that \u2018envisioned continuing and wide-reaching \ncontacts\u2019 in the forum State,\u201d Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1122 \n(alteration in original) (quoting Burger King, 472 U.S. at \n479-80), or \u201cby circulating magazines to \u2018deliberately ex-\nploi[t]\u2019 a market in the forum State.\u201d  Id. (alteration in \n\n171a \n \n \noriginal) (quoting Keeton, 465 U.S. at 781).  But there was \nno such purposeful connection to the forum in this case, \nand it would be impermissible to speculate based on scant \nevidence what the terrorists intended to do. \nFurthermore, the facts of Walden also suggest that a \ndefendant\u2019s mere knowledge that a plaintiff resides in a \nspecific jurisdiction would be insufficient to subject a de-\nfendant to specific jurisdiction in that jurisdiction if the de-\nfendant does nothing in connection with the tort in that ju-\nrisdiction.  In Walden, the petitioner was a police officer \nin Georgia who was working as a deputized Drug Enforce-\nment Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) agent at the Atlanta air-\nport.  He was informed that the respondents, Gina Fiore \nand Keith Gipson, were flying from San Juan, Puerto Rico \nthrough Atlanta en route to their final destination in Las \nVegas, Nevada.  See Joint Appendix, Walden v. Fiore, \n2013 WL 2390248, *41-42 (U.S.) (Decl. of Anthony Wal-\nden).  Walden and his DEA team stopped the respondents \nand searched their bags in Atlanta and examined their \nCalifornia drivers\u2019 licenses.  Id.; Walden, 134 S. Ct. at \n1119.  Walden found almost $100,000 in cash in the re-\nspondents\u2019 carry-on bag and seized it, giving rise to a claim \nfor an unconstitutional search under Bivens v. Six Un-\nknown Named Agents  of the Federal Bureau of Narcot-\nics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  See Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1119-20.  \nThe Supreme Court found that the petitioner\u2019s contacts \nwith Nevada were insufficient to establish personal juris-\ndiction over the petitioner in a Nevada federal court, even \nthough Walden knew that the respondents were destined \nfor Nevada.  See id. at 1119. \nIn this case, the plaintiffs point us to no evidence that \nthese indiscriminate terrorist attacks were specifically \ntargeted against United States citizens, and the mere \nknowledge that United States citizens might be wronged \nin a foreign country goes beyond the jurisdictional limit \nset forth in Walden. \n\n172a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs cite to several cases to support their ar-\ngument that specific jurisdiction is warranted under an \n\u201ceffects test.\u201d  Those cases are easily distinguishable from \nthis case.  Indeed, they point to the kinds of circumstances \nthat would give rise to specific jurisdiction under the ATA, \nwhich are not present here. \nFor example, in Mwani v. Bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1 \n(D.C. Cir. 2005), the Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit found that specific personal jurisdiction \nover Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda was supported by al-\nlegations that they \u201corchestrated the bombing of the \nAmerican embassy in Nairobi, not only to kill both Amer-\nican and Kenyan employees inside the building, but to \ncause pain and sow terror in the embassy\u2019s home country, \nthe United States,\u201d as well as allegations of \u201can ongoing \nconspiracy to attack the United States, with overt acts oc-\ncurring within this country\u2019s borders.\u201d  Id. at 13 (empha-\nsis added).  The plaintiffs pointed to the 1993 World Trade \nCenter bombing, as well as the plot to bomb the United \nNations, Federal Plaza, and the Lincoln and Holland Tun-\nnels in New York.  Id.  Furthermore, the Court of Appeals \nfound that bin Laden and al Qaeda \u201c\u2018purposefully directed\u2019 \n[their] activities at residents\u201d of the United States, and \nthat the case \u201cresult[ed] from injuries to the plaintiffs \u2018that \narise out of or relate to those activities,\u2019\u201d id. (quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472). \n\u201c[E]xercising specific jurisdiction because the victim \nof a foreign attack happened to be an American would run \nafoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that \u2018[d]ue process \nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum \nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not based \non the \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\u201d contacts he \nmakes by interacting with other persons affiliated with the \nState.\u2019\u201d Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 248 (quoting Walden, \n134 S. Ct. at 1123); see Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 52 (distin-\nguishing Mwani); see also In re Terrorist  Attacks on Sept. \n\n173a \n \n \n11, 2001, 538 F.3d at 95-96 (holding that even if Saudi \nprinces could and did foresee that Muslim charities would \nuse their donations to finance the September 11 attacks, \nproviding indirect funding to an organization that was \nopenly hostile to the United States did not constitute the \ntype of intentional conduct necessary to constitute pur-\nposeful direction of activities at the forum); Livnat, 82 F. \nSupp. 3d at 33. \nThe plaintiffs also rely on O\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 659, \nwhich related to the September 11 attacks.  In that case, \nthis Court first clarified that \u201cspecific personal jurisdiction \nproperly exists where the defendant took \u2018intentional, and \nallegedly tortious, actions . . . expressly aimed\u2019 at the fo-\nrum.\u201d  Id. at 674 (quoting Calder, 465 U.S. at 789).  This \nCourt also noted that, \u201cthe fact that harm in the forum is \nforeseeable . . . is insufficient for the purpose of establish-\ning specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant.\u201d  Id.  \nThis Court then held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were \ninsufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over about \ntwo dozen defendants, but that jurisdictional discovery \nwas warranted for twelve other defendants whose \u201calleged \nsupport of al Qaeda [was] more direct.\u201d  Id. at 678; see also \nid. at 656-66.  Those defendants \u201callegedly controlled and \nmanaged some of [the front] \u2018charitable organizations\u2019 \nand, through their positions of control, they allegedly sent \nfinancial and other material support directly to al Qaeda \nwhen al Qaeda allegedly was known to be targeting the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. (second emphasis added). \nThe plaintiffs argue that this Court should likewise \nfind jurisdiction because the defendants\u2019 \u201cdirect, knowing \nprovision of material support to designated FTOs [in this \ncase, Hamas and the AAMB] is enough---standing alone--\n-to sustain specific jurisdiction because they knowingly \naimed their conduct at U.S. interests.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Br. at 36.  But \nthat argument misreads O\u2019Neill.  In O\u2019Neill, this Court \nemphasized that the mere \u201cfact that harm in the forum is \n\n174a \n \n \nforeseeable\u201d was \u201cinsufficient for the purpose of establish-\ning specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant,\u201d 714 \nF.3d at 674, and the Court did not end its inquiry when it \nconcluded that the defendants may have provided support \nto terror organizations.  Indeed, the Court held that \u201cfac-\ntual issues persist with respect to whether this support \nwas \u2018expressly aimed\u2019 at the United States,\u201d warranting \njurisdictional discovery.  Id. at 678-79.  The Court looked \nat the specific aim of the group receiving support---partic-\nularly that al Qaeda was \u201cknown to be targeting the \nUnited States\u201d---and not simply that it and other defend-\nants were \u201cterrorist organizations.\u201d  Id. at 678.13 \nThe plaintiffs also cite Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 783.  \nIn that case, a California actress brought a libel suit in Cal-\nifornia state court against a reporter and an editor, both \nof whom worked for a tabloid at the tabloid\u2019s Florida head-\nquarters.  Id. at 784.  The plaintiff\u2019s claims were based on \nan article written and edited by the defendants in Florida \nfor the tabloid, which had a California circulation of about \n600,000.  Id. at 784-86.  The Supreme Court held that Cal-\nifornia\u2019s assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defend-\nants for a libel action was proper based on the effects of \nthe defendants\u2019 conduct in California.  Id. at 788.  \u201cThe ar-\nticle was drawn from California sources, and the brunt of \nthe harm, in terms both of respondent\u2019s emotional distress \nand the injury to her professional reputation, was suffered \nin California,\u201d the Supreme Court held.  Id. at 788-89.  \u201cIn \n \n13  Furthermore, the mere designation of a group as an FTO does not \nreflect that the organization has aimed its conduct at the United \nStates. The Secretary of State may \u201cdesignate an organization as a \nforeign terrorist organization\u201d if the Secretary finds \u201cthe organization \nis a foreign organization,\u201d \u201cthe organization engages in terrorist ac-\ntivity,\u201d \u201cor retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist ac-\ntivity or terrorism,\u201d and \u201cthe terrorist activity or terrorism of the or-\nganization threatens the security of United States nationals or the na-\ntional security of the United States.\u201d  8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a)(1)(A)-(C). \n\n175a \n \n \nsum, California is the focal point both of the story and of \nthe harm suffered.\u201d  Id. at 789 (emphasis added); see also \nWalden, 134 S. Ct. at 1123 (describing the contacts identi-\nfied in Calder as \u201cample\u201d to support specific jurisdiction).  \nAs the Supreme Court explained in Walden, the jurisdic-\ntional inquiry in Calder focused on the relationship among \nthe defendant, the forum, and the litigation.  Walden, 134 \nS. Ct. at 1123. \nUnlike in Calder, it cannot be said that the United \nStates is the focal point of the torts alleged in this litiga-\ntion.  In this case, the United States is not the nucleus of \nthe harm---Israel is.  See Safra, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 51. \nFinally, the plaintiffs rely on two criminal cases, \nUnited  States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2003) (per \ncuriam), and United States v. Al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108 (2d \nCir. 2011), for their argument that the \u201ceffects test\u201d sup-\nports jurisdiction.  In both cases, this Court applied the \ndue process test for asserting jurisdiction over extraterri-\ntorial criminal conduct, which differs from the test appli-\ncable in this civil case, see Al Kassar, 660 F.3d at 118; \nYousef, 327 F.3d at 111-12, and does not require a nexus \nbetween the specific criminal conduct and harm within the \nUnited States.  See also United States v. Murillo, No. 15-\n4235, 2016 WL 3257016, at *3 (4th Cir. June 14, 2016)(\u201c[I]t \nis not arbitrary to prosecute a defendant in the United \nStates if his actions affected significant American inter-\nests---even if the defendant did not mean to affect those \ninterests.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omit-\nted)).  In order to apply a federal criminal statute to a de-\nfendant extraterritorially consistent with due process, \n\u201c\u2018there must be a sufficient nexus between the defendant \nand the United States, so that such application would not \nbe arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.\u2019  For non-citizens \nacting entirely abroad, a jurisdictional nexus exists when \nthe aim of that activity is to cause harm inside the United \nStates or to U.S. citizens or interests.\u201d  Al Kassar, 660 \n\n176a \n \n \nF.3d 108, 118 (emphasis added) (quoting Yousef, 327 F.3d \nat 111). \nIn a civil action, as Walden makes clear, \u201cthe defend-\nant\u2019s suit-related conduct must create a substantial con-\nnection with the forum State.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 1121. \nEven setting aside the fact that both Yousef and Al \nKassar applied the more expansive due process test in \ncriminal cases, the defendants in both cases had more sub-\nstantial connections with the United States than the de-\nfendants have in the current litigation.  Yousef involved a \ncriminal prosecution for the bombing of an airplane trav-\neling from the Philippines to Japan.  See 327 F.3d at 79.  \nThe Yousef defendants \u201cconspired to attack a dozen \nUnited States-flag aircraft in an effort to inflict injury on \nthis country and its people and influence American foreign \npolicy, and their attack on the Philippine Airlines flight \nwas a \u2018test-run\u2019 in furtherance of this conspiracy.\u201d  Id. at \n112. \nIn Al Kassar, several defendants were convicted of \nconspiring to kill United States officers, to acquire and ex-\nport anti-aircraft missiles, and knowingly to provide mate-\nrial support to a terrorist organization; two were also con-\nvicted of conspiring to kill United States citizens and of \nmoney laundering.  660 F.3d at 115.  On appeal, the de-\nfendants challenged their convictions on a number of \ngrounds, including that the defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment \ndue process rights were violated by prosecuting them for \nactivities that occurred abroad.  Id. at 117-18.  This Court \nrejected that argument because the defendants conspired \nto sell arms to a group \u201cwith the understanding that they \nwould be used to kill Americans and destroy U.S. prop-\nerty; the aim therefore was to harm U.S. citizens and in-\nterests and to threaten the security of the United States.\u201d  \nId. at 118. \n\n177a \n \n \nIn this case, the defendants undertook terror attacks \nwithin Israel, and there is no evidence the attacks specifi-\ncally targeted United States citizens.  See Safra, 82 F. \nSupp. 3d at 53-54; see also Livnat, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 34. \nAccordingly, in the present case, specific jurisdiction \nis not appropriate under the \u201ceffects test.\u201d \nSecond, Walden undermines the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments \nthat the defendants met the \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d test \nby establishing a continuous presence in the United States \nand pressuring United States government policy.  The em-\nphasis on the defendants\u2019 Washington, D.C. mission con-\nfuses the issue: Walden requires that the \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d---here, the terror attacks in Israel---have a \u201csub-\nstantial connection with the forum.\u201d  134 S. Ct. at 1121.  \nThe defendants\u2019 Washington mission and its associated \nlobbying efforts do not support specific personal jurisdic-\ntion on the ATA claims.  The defendants cannot be made \nto answer in this forum \u201cwith respect to matters unrelated \nto the forum connections.\u201d  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 923; see \nalso Klieman, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 247 (\u201cCourts typically re-\nquire that the plaintiff show some sort of causal relation-\nship between a defendant\u2019s U.S. contacts and the episode \nin suit.\u201d). \nThe plaintiffs argue on appeal that the defendants in-\ntended their terror campaign to influence not just Israel, \nbut also the United States.  They point to trial evidence---\nspecifically pamphlets published by the PA---that, the \nplaintiffs argue, shows that the defendants were attempt-\ning to influence United States policy toward the Israel-\nPalestinian conflict.  The exhibits themselves speak in \nbroad terms of how United States interests in the region \nare in danger and how the United States and Europe \nshould exert pressure on Israel to change its practices to-\nward the Palestinians.  It is insufficient for purposes of due \nprocess to rely on evidence that a political organization \n\n178a \n \n \nsought to influence United States policy, without some \nother connection among the activities underlying the liti-\ngation, the defendants, and the forum.  Such attenuated \nactivity is insufficient under Walden. \nThe plaintiffs cite Licci, 732 F.3d 161, to support their \nargument that the defendants meet the purposeful avail-\nment test.  But the circumstances of that case are distin-\nguishable and illustrate why the defendants here do not \nmeet that test.  In Licci, American, Canadian, and Israeli \ncitizens who were injured or whose family members were \nkilled in a series of terrorist rocket attacks by Hizbollah in \nIsrael brought an action under the ATA and other laws \nagainst the Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL (\u201cLCB\u201d), \nwhich allegedly facilitated Hizbollah\u2019s acts by using corre-\nspondent banking accounts at a defendant New York bank \n(American Express Bank Ltd.) to effectuate wire trans-\nfers totaling several million dollars on Hizbollah\u2019s behalf.  \nId. at 164-66.  This Court concluded that the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants was constitu-\ntional because of the defendants\u2019 \u201crepeated use of New \nYork\u2019s banking system, as an instrument for accomplish-\ning the alleged wrongs for which the plaintiffs seek re-\ndress.\u201d  Id. at 171.  These contacts constituted \u201c\u2018purpose-\nful[] avail[ment] . . . of the privilege of doing business in \n[New York],\u2019 so as to permit the subjecting of LCB to spe-\ncific jurisdiction within the Southern District of New York \n. . . .\u201d  Id. (quoting Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d at \n127). \n\u201cIt should hardly be unforeseeable to a bank that se-\nlects and makes use of a particular forum\u2019s banking sys-\ntem that it might be subject to the burden of a lawsuit in \nthat forum for wrongs related to, and arising from, that \nuse.\u201d  Id. at 171-72 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). \nIn Licci, this Court also distinguished the \u201ceffects \ntest\u201d theory of personal jurisdiction which is \u201ctypically \n\n179a \n \n \ninvoked where (unlike here) the conduct that forms the \nbasis for the controversy occurs entirely out-of-forum, and \nthe only relevant jurisdictional contacts with the forum are \ntherefore in-forum effects harmful to the plaintiff.\u201d  Id. at \n173 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).  The Court held \nthat the effects test was inappropriate because \u201cthe con-\nstitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign \ndefendant\u201d turned on conduct that \u201coccur[ed] within the \nforum,\u201d id. (emphasis in original), namely the repeated use \nof bank accounts in New York to support the alleged \nwrongs for which the plaintiffs sued. \nIn this case, there is no such connection between the \nconduct on which the alleged personal jurisdiction is based \nand the forum.  And the connections the defendants do \nhave with the United States---the Washington, D.C. and \nNew York missions---revolve around lobbying activities \nthat are not proscribed by the ATA and are not connected \nto the wrongs for which the plaintiffs here seek redress. \nAt a hearing before the district court, the plaintiffs \nalso cited Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d 120, as their \n\u201cbest case\u201d for their purposeful availment argument.  See \nJ.A. 1128.  But that case, too, is distinguishable.  There, a \nclient bank sued its lawyers for legal malpractice that oc-\ncurred in Puerto Rico.  Bank Brussels Lambert, 305 F.3d \nat 123.  This Court held that the Puerto Rican law firm \ndefendant had sufficient minimum contacts with the New \nYork forum and purposely availed itself of the privilege of \ndoing business in New York, because, although the law \nfirm did not solicit the bank as a client in New York, the \nfirm maintained an apartment in New York partially for \nthe purpose of better servicing its New York clients, the \nfirm faxed newsletters regarding Puerto Rican legal de-\nvelopments to persons in New York, the firm had numer-\nous New York clients, and its marketing materials touted \nthe firm\u2019s close relationship with the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York. Id. at 127-29.  \u201cThe engagement which \n\n180a \n \n \ngave rise to the dispute here is not simply one of a string \nof fortunate coincidences for the firm.  Rather, the picture \nwhich emerges from the above facts is that of a law firm \nwhich seeks to be known in the New York legal market, \nmakes efforts to promote and maintain a client base there, \nand profits substantially therefrom.\u201d  Id. at 128.  This \nCourt held that there was \u201cnothing fundamentally unfair \nabout requiring the firm to defend itself in the New York \ncourts when a dispute arises from its representation of a \nNew York client---a representation which developed in a \nmarket it had deliberately cultivated and which, after all, \nthe firm voluntarily undertook.\u201d  Id. at 129.  In short, the \ndefendants\u2019 contacts with the forum were sufficiently re-\nlated to the malpractice claims that were at issue in the \nsuit. \nThat is not the case here.  The plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not \narise from the defendants\u2019 purposeful contacts with the fo-\nrum.  And where the defendant in Bank Brussels Lambert \npurposefully and repeatedly reached into New York to ob-\ntain New York clients---and as a result of those activities, \nit obtained a representation for which it was sued---in this \ncase, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not arise from any activity \nby the defendants in this forum. \nThus, in this case, unlike in Licci and Bank Brussels \nLambert, the defendants are not subject to specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction based on a \u201cpurposeful availment\u201d the-\nory because the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not arise from the de-\nfendants\u2019 activity in the forum. \nThird, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction under the ATA by appoint-\ning an agent to accept process.  It is clear that the ATA \npermitted service of process on the representative of the \nPLO and PA in Washington.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a).  \nHowever, the statute does not answer the constitutional \nquestion of whether due process is satisfied. \n\n181a \n \n \nThe plaintiffs contend that under United States v. \nScophony Corp. of America, 333 U.S. 795 (1948), meeting \nthe statutory requirement for service of process suffices \nto establish personal jurisdiction.  But Scophony does not \nstand for that proposition.  The defendant in Scophony \n\u201cwas \u2018transacting business\u2019 of a substantial character in \nthe New York district at the times of service, so as to es-\ntablish venue there,\u201d and so that \u201csuch a ruling presents \nno conceivable element of offense to \u2018traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at 818 (quoting Int\u2019l \nShoe, 326 U.S. at 316).  Thus, Scophony affirms the under-\nstanding, echoed by this Court in Licci, 673 F.3d at 60, and \nO\u2019Neill, 714 F.3d at 673-74, that due process analysis---\nconsiderations of minimum contacts and reasonableness--\n-applies even when federal service-of-process statutes are \nsatisfied.  Simply put, \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion must comport with constitutional due process princi-\nples.\u201d  Licci, 673 F.3d at 60; see also Brown, 814 F.3d at \n641.  As explained above, due process is not satisfied in this \ncase, and the courts have neither general nor specific per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the defendants, regardless of the \nservice-of-process statute. \nIn sum, because the terror attacks in Israel at issue \nhere were not expressly aimed at the United States and \nbecause the deaths and injuries suffered by the American \nplaintiffs in these attacks were \u201crandom [and] fortuitous\u201d \nand because lobbying activities regarding American policy \ntoward Israel are insufficiently \u201csuit-related conduct\u201d to \nsupport specific jurisdiction, the Court lacks specific juris-\ndiction over these defendants.  Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121, \n1123. \n*** \nThe terror machine gun attacks and suicide bombings \nthat triggered this suit and victimized these plaintiffs were \nunquestionably horrific.  But the federal courts cannot \n\n182a \n \n \nexercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits pre-\nscribed by the due process clause of the Constitution, no \nmatter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally \ncompelling the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. \nThe district court could not constitutionally exercise \neither general or specific personal jurisdiction over the de-\nfendants in this case.  Accordingly, this case must be dis-\nmissed. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the arguments of the par-\nties.  To the extent not specifically addressed above, they \nare either moot or without merit.  For the reasons ex-\nplained above, we VACATE the judgment of the district \ncourt and REMAND the case to the district court with in-\nstructions to DISMISS the case for want of jurisdiction. \n\n \n \n(183a) \nAPPENDIX H \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n---------------------------------------- \nX  \nMARK I.

DANIELS, District Judge: \nIn the above-captioned action brought under the An-\ntiterrorism Act of 1991, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 et. seq. (\u201cATA\u201d), \nUnited States citizens and guardians, family members, \n\n187a \n \n \nand personal representatives of the estates of United \nStates citizens, are suing the Palestine Liberation Organ-\nization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the Palestinian Authority1 (\u201cPA\u201d) for \ninjuries and death allegedly suffered as a result of a series \nof seven terrorist attacks occurring over a three year pe-\nriod in or near Jerusalem from January 8, 2001, to January \n29, 2004. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 54-125. Plaintiffs assert causes \nof action for international terrorism, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333,2 and various state law claims including wrongful \ndeath, pain and suffering, battery, assault, loss of consor-\ntium, negligence, and infliction of emotional distress. De-\nfendants move to dismiss the Amended Complaint for lack \nof personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(2). Defendants\u2019 motion is DENIED. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nIn response to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a default judg-\nment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, Defendants moved to \ndismiss the Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter \nand personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1) and (2), and to dismiss the pendant state law \ncauses of action for failure to state a claim, pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). See Docket ## 22, 45. Plaintiffs \nopposed Defendants\u2019 prior motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, and, in the alternative, sought juris-\ndictional discovery. See Docket # 50. This Court denied \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction with prejudice, and denied their motion to \n \n1 The Palestinian Authority is also known as \u201cThe Palestinian In-\nterim Self-Government Authority,\u201d \u201cThe Palestinian Council\u201d and \n\u201cThe Palestinian National Authority.\u201d \n2 Section 2333 is the civil provision of the ATA, which provides that \n\u201c[a]ny national of the United States injured in his or her person, prop-\nerty, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism, or his \nor her estate, survivors or heirs may sue therefore . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 \n2333(a). \n\n188a \n \n \ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state \na claim without prejudice to renew after limited jurisdic-\ntional discovery. See Sololow v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n583 F. Supp. 2d 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), available at Docket \n# 58. \nThe parties engaged in jurisdictional discovery under \nthe supervision of Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis. See \nDocket # 61. Defendants prematurely renewed their mo-\ntion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) during jurisdictional discovery, \nand this Court denied the motion without prejudice to re-\nnew after the completion of jurisdictional discovery. See \nDocket ## 66, 79. After the Magistrate Judge declared \ndiscovery complete, Defendants properly filed the instant \nmotion to dismiss. See Docket ## 80, 67. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nTo withstand a 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff \n\u201cbears the burden of showing [by a preponderance of the \nevidence] that the court has jurisdiction over the defend-\nant.\u201d In re Magnetic Audiotape Antitrust Lithog., 334 \nF.3d 204, 206 (2d Cir. 2003); Landoil Resources Corp. v. \nAlexander & Alexander Servs., Inc., 918 F.2d 1039, 1043 \n(2d Cir. 1990). The showing necessary to satisfy this bur-\nden is more demanding when, as is the case here, the par-\nties have completed jurisdictional discovery.3 Whereas le-\ngally sufficient allegations are alone sufficient to make a \nprima facie showing where no evidentiary hearing has \nbeen held, or when the parties have not engaged in juris-\ndictional discovery, \u201c[a]fter discovery, the plaintiff\u2019s prima \nfacie showing . . . must include an averment of facts that, \nif credited by the trier, would suffice to establish \n \n3 It is appropriate to apply the higher burden in the present case \nregardless of how dissatisfied Plaintiffs may be with Defendants\u2019 pro-\nductions. The appropriate time to seek relief for such grievances has \nexpired now that jurisdictional discovery is complete. \n\n189a \n \n \njurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d4 Ball v. Metallurgic Ho-\nboken \u2014 Overpelt S.A., 902 F.2d 194, 197 (2d Cir. 1990); \nsee also Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 \nF.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir. 2010). The Court is to accept all aver-\nments of jurisdictional facts as true, and construe the \npleadings, affidavits, and any doubts in plaintiff\u2019s favor. \nSee In re Magnetic Audiotape, 334 F.3d at 206; PDK \nLabs. Inc. v. Friedlander, 103 F.3d 1105, 1108 (2d Cir. \n1997); see also Whitaker v. American Telecasting Inc., 261 \nF.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting A.I. Trade Fin., Inc. \nv. Petra Bank, 989 F.2d 76, 79-80 (2d Cir. 1993)). \nGENERAL JURISDICTION \nIn the context of ATA litigation, a plaintiff makes a \nprima facie showing of personal jurisdiction if: (1) service \nof process was properly effected as to the defendant, see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C) (\u201cServing a summons . . . estab-\nlishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant . . . when au-\nthorized by a federal statute\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(a) \n(providing for nationwide service of process and venue); \nand (2) the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts \nwith the United States as a whole to satisfy a traditional \ndue process analysis. See Estates of Ungar v. Palestinian \nAuth., 153 F. Supp. 2d 76, 87, 95 (D.R.I. 2001); see also In \nre Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F. Supp. \n2d 539, 556-58 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Burnett v. Al Baraka Inv. \n& Dev. Corp., 349 F. Supp. 2d 765, 806-07 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); \nBiton v. Palestinian Interim Self-Gov\u2019t Auth., 310 F. \nSupp. 2d 172, 179 (D.D.C. 2004).  \nHere, Defendants do not assert that service was de-\nfective. Defendants do not even dispute that, during the \n \n4 Plaintiffs have not provided an exhaustive list of the facts that they \nbelieve confer jurisdiction over the Defendants. However, Plaintiffs \nhave provided all of the materials submitted in Estates of Ungar v. \nPalestinian Auth., 325 F. Supp. 2d 15 (D.R.I. 2004), as well as addi-\ntional materials relevant to post-2002 activities. \n\n190a \n \n \nrelevant time period, they maintained sufficient contacts \nwith the United States to satisfy the traditional due pro-\ncess analysis for general jurisdiction. Rather, Defendants \ncontend that their contacts with the United States qualify \nas jurisdictional exceptions and may not be relied upon to \nsupport the exercise of general jurisdiction over them. \nThey contend that any remaining contacts are insubstan-\ntial. \nA.  SERVICE \nPlaintiffs\u2019 properly served the PLO and the PLA. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B) provides that a foreign associa-\ntion \u201cmust be served[] . . . in a judicial district of the United \nStates . . . by delivering a copy of the summons and of the \ncomplaint to an officer, a managing or general agent.\u201d \nHere, Plaintiffs personally served Hassan Abdel Rahman \nat his home in Virginia. See Pls.\u2019 Opposition Memo, Ex. B \n(\u201cAffidavit of Service\u201d). Rahman, based upon the over-\nwhelming competent evidence produced by Plaintiffs,5 was \nthe Chief Representative of the PLO and the PA in the \nUnited States at the time of service. Rahman was thus a \nvalid agent for service of process on the PLO and the PA.6 \n \n5 See Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., Exs. C (business card identifying him as \n\u201cChief Representative\u201d to the \u201cPalestine Liberation Organization\u201d \nand the \u201cPalestine National Authority\u201d), D (letter written by him to \nCongressman Abercrombie in which he identifies himself as \u201cChief \nRepresentative of the PLO and PNA\u201d), E (letter sent to him by Rich-\nard C.

Strachman, Ex. 1 (reproducing evidence of Rahman\u2019s dual \nagency from Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 55-59). \n6 This finding is consistent with other federal courts. See, e.g., \nKliman v. Palestine Authority, 547 F.Supp.2d 8, 13-14 (D.D.C. 2008) \n\n191a \n \n \nB.  SERVICE \nTo determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction \ncomports with due process, the Court must engage in a \ntwo part analysis: \u201cthe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 inquiry and the \n\u2018reasonableness\u2019 inquiry.\u201d Chloe v. Queen Bee of Beverly \nHills. LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 171 (2d Cir. 2010). The court \nmust first determine whether a defendant has minimum \ncontacts with the forum such that maintenance of the ac-\ntion does not offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice. See State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan Repub-\nlic v. Frontera, 582 F.3d 393, 396 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation \nomitted). The court must then determine whether it would \nbe reasonable, under the circumstances of the particular \ncase, to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. See \nMetro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, \n568 (2d Cir. 1996). \n1.  Minimum Contacts7 \nThe minimal contacts inquiry necessitates \u201ca distinc-\ntion . . . between \u2018specific\u2019 jurisdiction and \u2018general\u2019 juris-\ndiction.\u201d Chloe, 616 F.3d at 165. Whereas specific \n \n(considering Haman\u2019s successor); Ungar, 325 F. Supp. 2d at 55-59 \n(considering Haman); Biton, 310 F. Supp. 2d at 179-190 (same). \n7 This Court conducts a de novo review of the minimal contacts of the \nPLO and the PA. Upon first considering the issue of personal juris-\ndiction in the above-captioned action, this Court recognized that \u201c[a] \nnumber of federal courts [had already] concluded that both the PA \nand PLO have sufficient minimum contacts with the United States to \njustify the exercise of personal jurisdiction under the Due Process \nClause.\u201d Sololow, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 460 (citations omitted). This \nCourt, nevertheless, held that \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction must be deter-\nmined on a case-by-case basis because it is dependent upon the de-\nfendants\u2019 contacts with the [United States] at the time the lawsuit was \ncommenced.\u201d Id. at 460. This Court thus declined to entertain Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 arguments that the principles of collateral estoppel and/or the \npresumption of continuity preclude or otherwise limit Defendants\u2019 lit-\nigation of the personal jurisdiction issue. \n\n192a \n \n \njurisdiction applies where a defendant\u2019s contacts are re-\nlated to the litigation, general jurisdiction applies where \nthey are unrelated, and involves a more stringent minimal \ncontacts test. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia., \nS.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414, 415 n.9; see also Metro Life, \n84 F.3d at 568. General jurisdiction requires that each8 de-\nfendant\u2019s contacts with the forum are continuous and sys-\ntematic. Id. In determining the strength of those contacts, \nthe court is to examine the totality of the defendant\u2019s con-\ntacts with the forum over a period of time that is reasona-\nble under the circumstances, up to and including the date \nthe suit was filed.9 See Chloe, 616 F.3d at 164; Porina v. \nMarward Shipping Co., 521 F.3d 122, 128 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(citation omitted). Additionally, the defendant must be \nfound to have purposely availed himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities in the forum. See Hanson v. Denckla, \n357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). \na.  Traditional Jurisdictional Analysis \nAfter carefully reviewing the competent evidence pro-\nduced, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have gone beyond \nthe allegations in the Amended Complaint to demonstrate \nby a preponderance of the evidence that the PLO and the \nPA purposely engaged in numerous activities that re-\nsulted in both entities having a continuous and systematic \n \n8 \u201cEach defendant\u2019s contacts with the [United States] must be as-\nsessed individually,\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction cannot be implied or imputed \nfrom one defendant to another.\u201d Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., \n465 U.S. 770, 781 n.13 (1984); Langenberg v. Sofair, 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 65276, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2006); see also Rush v. \nSavchuk, 444 U.S. 320, 331-32 (1980). \n9 For the purpose of discovery, the parties agreed that the relevant \ntime period was the six-year period preceding the filing of the com-\nplaint, i.e. January 16, 1998, to January 16, 2004. See Pls. Opp. Mem., \nat 5; Defs. Opening Mem., at 7-8. Such periods have been found to be \nreasonable by the Second Circuit. See Metro Life, 84 F.3d at 569-70 \n(collecting cases). \n\n193a \n \n \npresence within the United States. Therefore, this Court \nagrees with every federal court to have considered the is-\nsue that the totality of activities in the United States by \nthe PLO and the PA justifies the exercise of general per-\nsonal jurisdiction.10 \nIt is undisputed that the PLO maintained an office in \nWashington, D.C., during the relevant period. See Defs.\u2019 \nOpening Mem., at 8-9; Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., at 10; see also \nStrachman Declaration, Ex. 1 Part 5 (\u201cRevised Notice\u201d), \nEx.

See id., Ex. 3, at 9. \nThe parties disagree over whether the PA maintained \nan office in Washington, D.C.; however the weight of the \nevidence indicates that the D.C. office simultaneously \nserved as an office for the PLO and the PA.12 The initial \nregistration statement states that \u201c[t]he PLO offices in \nWashington, D.C. shall represent the PLO and the Pales-\ntinian Authority in the United States\u201d and that \u201c[t]he PLO \nand the Palestinian Authority will pay for the expenses of \nthe office and salaries of its employees.\u201d Strachman Dec-\nlaration, Ex. 1 Part 5, Ex. KK. Rahman, the Chief Repre-\nsentative of the PLO and the PA, used and was contacted \nat a single address \u2013 that of the D.C. office. See Pls.\u2019 Opp. \nMem., Exs. C-E. The PA entered into a substantial com-\nmercial contract that repeatedly described the D.C. office \nas an office of the PA. See id., F (retainer agreement for \n1999-2002). Finally, the PA\u2019s Ministry of Finance \u2013 rather \nthan the PLO Headquarters in Gaza \u2013 provided the vast \n \n11 Defendants did not provide precise dates of employment. Constru-\ning all facts in a light favorable to Plaintiffs, the lack of duplication \namongst the titles and job descriptions of the PLO employees sug-\ngests that the majority of the twelve employees were present for the \nentirety of the relevant period. See Defs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, at 9. \n12 Defendants\u2019 argument that only the PLO had the authority to con-\nduct foreign affairs is unpersuasive. The fact that the PA should not \nhave been operating an office in the United States does not mean that \nit did not or could not have done so. Moreover, even if Defendants\u2019 are \nright, \u201cthere is nothing in the Oslo Accords . . . prohibit[ing] the PA \nfrom conducting other non-diplomatic activities (such as commercial, \npublic relations, lobbying, or educational activities) through its repre-\nsentatives, officers and agents abroad.\u201d Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 54. \nAlso the fact that only 2 of the 14 employees at the D.C. office were \nemployed by the PA does not demonstrate that D.C. office was not \nworking on behalf of the PA. See Defs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3 (Inter-\nrogatories), at 6, 10-11. \n\n195a \n \n \nmajority of the D.C. office\u2019s income. See Strachman Dec-\nlaration, Exs. 2-12. Accordingly, the activities of the D.C. \noffice are attributable to both the PLO and the PA.13 \nThe Defendants, through the D.C. office, had a sub-\nstantial commercial presence in the United States. The \nDefendants operated a fully and continuously functional \noffice in Washington, D.C., during the relevant period. De-\nfendants had thirty-five land line telephone and cell phone \nnumbers and two bank accounts from 2002-2004.14 See \nDefs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, at 20-22. The Defendants had \na CD account as late as January 2003. Id., Ex. 3, at 20. De-\nfendants also had ongoing commercial contracts and \ntransactions with numerous U.S.-based businesses, in-\ncluding for office supplies and equipment, postage/ship-\nping, new services/subscriptions, telecommunications/in-\nternet, IT support, accountant and legal services, and \ncredit cards. See id., Ex. 4 (\u201cDocument Requests\u201d), at 9-\n10. Defendants even paid for certain living expenses of \nRahman. See id., Ex. 4, at 10. \nFurthermore, the PA retained a consulting and lobby-\ning firm through a multi-year, multimillion dollar contract. \nSee Pls.\u2019 Opp. Mem., Ex. F. That contract resulted in the \nperformance of services from November 1999 to at least \nApril 2004. See id., Ex G.

Based upon required disclosures to \nfederal authorities, the D.C. office engaged in extensive \npublic relations activities throughout the United States, \nranging from interviews and speeches to attending and \nparticipating in various public events.

See id., Exs. \n2-12; see also Unger, 325 F.Supp.2d at 4950 (summarizing \nthe millions of dollars spend on media and public relations \nactivities from 1999-2001). Rahman, the Chief Repre-\nsentative of the PLO and the PA in the United States, par-\nticipated in at least 158 public interviews and media ap-\npearances between January 1998 and January 2004.18 See \nStachman Declaration \u00b6 18 (listing events); id., Ex. 13 \n(providing transcripts). Most were broadcasted on major \nnational news networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, \nABC, and MSNBC. \nc.  \nJurisdictional Exceptions \nCertain activities fall under jurisdictional exceptions \nand may not be properly considered as a basis of jurisdic-\ntion. See Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-\nGestione, 937 F.2d 44, 51 n.7 (2d Cir. 1991) (noting exam-\nples). However, there is not a presumption that a jurisdic-\ntional exception applies where a dispute exists over ex-\ncluding particular contacts. A plaintiff is not required to \ndisprove the applicability of a jurisdictional exception \nsimply because one is asserted by a defendant. A \n \n17 Approximate total are as follows: 14 events in the six month period \nending September 1998. See Strachman Declaration, Ex. 2. 13 events \nin the six month period ending March 1999. Id., Ex. 3. 20 events in the \nsix month period ending September 1999. Id., Ex. 4. 15 events in the \nsix month period ending March 2000.

Id., Ex. 12. \n18 Many of these events do not appear to have been disclosed in the \nrequired filings. \n\n198a \n \n \ndefendant bears the burden of demonstrating that it is en-\ntitled to the benefits of a jurisdictional exception, trigger-\ning a re-assessment of the sufficiency of a plaintiff\u2019s prima \nfacie case. Unsupported allegations and assertions are \nsimply insufficient after the parties have engaged in juris-\ndictional discovery. \nWith respect to foreign entities such as the PLO and \nthe PA engaging in activities in the United States, two ex-\nceptions may be applicable. First, jurisdiction in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia over a person or entity may not be \ngrounded on the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontacts with a federal in-\nstrumentality,\u201d including where contacts only consist of \n\u201clobbying activity before federal agencies to secure their \nown proprietary interests.\u201d Bechtel & Cole v. Graceland \nBroadcasting, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 4468, at *3 (D.C. \nCir. Mar. 9, 1994) (citing Environmental Research Intl, \nInc. v. Lockwood Greene Engineers, Inc., 355 A.2d 808, \n813 (D.C. 1976) (en banc)); id. (citing Naartex Consulting \nCorp. v. Watt, 232 U.S. App. D.C. 293, 722 F.2d 779, 787 \n(D.C.

See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51-52. With re-\nspect to the PLO\u2019s New York office, the parties have pro-\nduced little evidence, but no factual dispute appears to ex-\nist. The PLO operated and owned an office in New York \n \n19 See also Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51 (noting that the government \ncontacts exception covers non-resident\u2019s \u201cgetting information from or \ngiving information to the government, or getting the government\u2019s \npermission to do something.\u201d) (quoting Investment Co.

See Dfs.\u2019 Opening Mem., Ex. 3, \nat 19-20. The PLO employed twenty employees at the New \nYork office for all or a portion of the relevant period, and \nthe PA employed one. Id., Ex. 3, at 6. The New York office \nhad a checking account and at least two telephone lines. \nId., Ex. 3, at 20, 22. Finally, Nasser Al-Kidwa, the ambas-\nsador during the relevant period, participated on behalf of \nthe PLO in at least 73 media appearances and interviews \nbetween 2000 and 2003 on a mix of major national news \nnetworks and local stations. See Strachman Declaration \u00b6 \n20 (listing events); id., Ex. 14 (transcripts). \nDefendants assert that none of the contacts associ-\nated with the D.C. and New York offices can be considered \nfor purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction pursuant \nto the aforementioned exceptions. Defendants do not, \nhowever, provide any evidence demonstrating that either \noffice exclusively and solely dealt with the federal govern-\nment or the UN. Nor have Defendants made an effort to \ndemonstrate that their activities in Washington, D.C., and \nNew York were commensurate with their special diplo-\nmatic need for being present in those cities. See, e.g., Fan-\ndel v. Arabian American Oil Co., 345 F.2d 87, 89 (D.C. Cir. \n1965). With respect to the activities involving the New \nYork office, Defendants are entitled to the Klinghoffer ju-\nrisdictional exception. Plaintiffs have failed to identify any \ncontacts that raise a dispute over the exclusivity of the ac-\ntivities conducted from the New York office, and, in any \nevent, the evidence indicates that the activities were pri-\nmarily related to the PLO\u2019s UN affairs. \nWith respect to the activities involving the D.C. office, \nDefendants have failed to demonstrate by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that any of the contacts should be ex-\ncluded by either jurisdictional exception. The Klinghoffer \njurisdictional exception is inapplicable because there is no \n\n200a \n \n \nevidence that the D.C.-based activities involved UN af-\nfairs,20 and because the exception does not provide for a \nblanket immunization of all contacts in the United States. \nDefendants have failed to demonstrate by a preponder-\nance of the evidence that their activities from the Wash-\nington, D.C. office exclusively involved contacting some \nbranch of the federal government. Outside of New York, \nDefendants are no different than any other political organ-\nization based in Washington, D.C.,21 and yet the record \ncontains overwhelming evidence that Defendants were \nprimarily in Washington, D.C. pursuing their political in-\nterest, but were not solely conducting diplomatic activities \nwith our government. \nNevertheless, even after excluding activities con-\nducted in furtherance of the PLO\u2019s observer status and \ncontacts with the federal government, the remaining \n \n20 Defendants never assert that they were conducting UN affairs \nfrom the D.C. office. In fact, the evidence \u2013 namely, the deposition tes-\ntimony of Said M. Hamad, Deputy Chief in the D.C. office \u2013 indicates \nthat they had no involvement with UN activities.  \nQ: And the office in New York, are you involved with that office at \nall? Do you communicate with them?  \nA No.; \nQ Why is that?  \nA Because they have their own business at U.N. Q And you don\u2019t \ncoordinate any activities?  \nA Well, there\u2019s no activities to coordinate. They have their own \nbusiness. Their mission is the United States. We have nothing to do \nwith them, they have nothing to do with us, except hello and all.  \nSee Strachman Declaration, Ex. N, at 31. \n21 Palestine, as discussed in this Court\u2019s 9/30/2008 Memorandum De-\ncision and Order, is not recognized, under United States law, as a \u2018for-\neign state.\u2019\u201d Sokolow, 583 F. Supp. 2d at 458. \u201c[D]efendants cannot \nderivatively secure sovereign immunity as agencies and/or instrumen-\ntalities of Palestine,\u201d and \u201cthe PA is [not] . . . entitled to immunity as \na political subdivision of Israel.\u201d Id. \n\n201a \n \n \ncontacts would still provide a sufficient basis to exercise \ngeneral jurisdiction over the Defendants. See, e.g., Unger, \n325 F. Supp. 2d at 53; see also Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro Ed Altri-Gestione etc., 795 F. Supp. 112, 114 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1992). The PLO and the PA were continuously \nand systematically present in the United States by virtue \nof their extensive public relations activities. Whether char-\nacterized as diplomatic public-speaking or proselytizing, \nthe forums and audiences clearly indicate that the vast \nmajority of these appearances were not directly communi-\ncating to or sponsored by the federal government or the \nUnited Nations General Assembly. These appearances \nwere separate from Defendants\u2019 diplomatic foreign affairs \nfunctions in the United States, such as the PLO\u2019s right to \nspeak at the United Nations General Assembly meetings, \nor the PLO or the PA\u2019s efforts to petition the United \nStates government. This alone is a sufficient basis to de-\ncline to ignore the entire physical presence, commercial \ntransactions, and other activities of the D.C. office. Thus, \nas found in Unger, \u201ceven if the court excludes from its con-\nsideration contacts by the Washington Office of the PLO \nwith the federal government [or by the New York office \nwith the UN], the other activities of that office are suffi-\ncient to allow this court to find minimum contacts.\u201d 325 F. \nSupp. 2d at 53; see also Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro Ed Altri-Gestione, 795 F. Supp. 112, 114 (S.D.N.Y. \n1992). \n3. \nReasonableness \nThe second part of the jurisdictional analysis asks \n\u201cwhether the assertion of personal jurisdiction comports \nwith \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice\u2019 \u2013 that is, whether it is reasonable under the circum-\nstances of the particular case.\u201d Metro. Life, 84 F.3d at 568 \n(quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, \n90 L. Ed. 95, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945)). Where a plaintiff makes \nthe threshold showing of the minimum contacts required \n\n202a \n \n \nto meet the first test, a defendant must present \u201ca compel-\nling case that the presence of some other considerations \nwould render jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d Id. (quoting \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 477). Courts are to consider five \nfactors in evaluating reasonableness: \u201c(1) the burden that \nthe exercise of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant; \n(2) the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the \ncase; (3) the plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining convenient and \neffective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system\u2019s interest \nin obtaining the most efficient resolution of the contro-\nversy; and (5) the shared interest of the states in further-\ning substantive social policies.\u201d Id. at 568 (citing Asahi \nMetal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113-14 \n(1987); Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476-47)).  \nHere, neither the PLO nor the PA has presented a \ncompelling case that exercising jurisdiction over them in \nthe present action will offend the Constitution or federal \nlaw. The reality is that ATA litigation often involves for-\neign individuals and entities, and thereby, a statutory \ncause of action for international terrorism exists. There is \na strong inherent interest of the United States and Plain-\ntiffs in litigating ATA claims in the United States. The De-\nfendants have not demonstrated that this case would im-\npose a more significant burden than can typically be ex-\npected, particularly in light of the fact that they have vig-\norously engaged in such litigation several times before. \nThe Defendants have also failed to identify an alternative \nforum where Plaintiffs\u2019 claims could be brought, and \nwhere the foreign court could grant a substantially similar \nremedy. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of personal ju-\nrisdiction is DENIED.  \n\n203a \n \n \n \nDated:  New York, New York  \n \nMarch 30, 2011 \nSO ORDERED. \n George B.

Following disposition of the appeals in these \ncases on September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs- Appellants and In-\ntervenor-Appellant filed petitions for rehearing en banc \nand an active judge of the Court thereafter requested a \npoll on whether to rehear the case en banc. A poll having \nbeen conducted and there being no majority favoring en \nbanc review, the petition for rehearing en banc is hereby \nDENIED. \nJoseph F. Bianco, Circuit Judge, concurs by opinion in \nthe denial of rehearing en banc. \nSteven J. Menashi, Circuit Judge, joined by Debra \nAnn Livingston, Chief Judge, Michael H. Park, Circuit \nJudge, and joined in Part I by Richard J. Sullivan, Circuit \nJudge, dissents by opinion from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc. \nPierre N. Leval, Circuit Judge, filed a statement with \nrespect to the denial of rehearing en banc. \nAlison J. Nathan, Circuit Judge, took no part in the \nconsideration or decision of the petition. \nFOR THE COURT: \nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk \n \n \n\n209a \n \n \nJOSEPH F. BIANCO, Circuit Judge, concurring in the or-\nder denying rehearing en banc: \nI concur in the denial of the petition for rehearing en \nbanc and, as a member of the unanimous panel issuing the \nopinions that are the subject of the petition, write to ex-\nplain my disagreement with the views expressed by the \ndissent. \nAs discussed in the panel opinions in these cases, and \ndiscussed in greater detail below, although these appeals \ninvolved the question of personal jurisdiction in the context \nof a novel statutory structure, the analysis in both opinions \nfollowed clear precedent from the Supreme Court and did \nnot articulate any new legal rule. In contrast, the dissent \nproposes a new rule of \u201cdeemed consent\u201d or \u201cconstructive \nconsent\u201d for purposes of personal jurisdiction, which has \nnever been recognized by the Supreme Court nor by any \nother court and is fundamentally incompatible with exist-\ning precedent for determining consent to waive a constitu-\ntional right. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s proposed holding that \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not \nlimit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts \nin the same way as the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment is not only contrary to our well-settled \nprecedent, but also has been rejected by each of the other \nsix sister circuits who has addressed that issue. There is \nno persuasive reason to depart from the principles of stare \ndecisis and create a new rule that could have far-reaching \nramifications for the entire body of personal jurisdiction \njurisprudence beyond these two particular cases. \nThe principle that a court must have personal jurisdic-\ntion over a defendant \u201crecognizes and protects an individ-\nual liberty interest\u201d flowing from the Constitution\u2019s guar-\nantees of due process. Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des \nBauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982). The \n\n210a \n \n \nSupreme Court has recognized three bases for exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over an out-of-forum defendant in ac-\ncordance with the dictates of due process: general juris-\ndiction, specific jurisdiction, and consent. See, e.g., Burger \nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472\u201373 (1985). \nConsent to personal jurisdiction is a voluntary agreement \non the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular forum. \nSee Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, \n316 (1964); J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 880\u201381 (2011) (plurality opinion). \nThe plaintiffs in these cases relied on a theory of \ndeemed consent or constructive consent to justify personal \njurisdiction in federal court. More particularly, the plain-\ntiffs in these cases are the victims or relatives of victims of \nterrorist attacks in the West Bank or Israel. They sued \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) and the \nPalestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d), seeking damages for alleged \nviolations of the Anti-Terrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333, related to those attacks. In both cases, it was un-\ndisputed that the district court did not have general juris-\ndiction over the PLO and the PA because those organiza-\ntions were not \u201cat home\u201d in the United States. It was also \nundisputed that there was no specific jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA because the activities at issue occurred \nabroad and were random acts of terror, rather than acts \ndirected against United States citizens. \nThe only asserted basis for personal jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA was the Promoting Security and Jus-\ntice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), in \nwhich Congress provided that the PLO and the PA \u201cshall \nbe deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in \nany civil ATA action upon engaging in certain forms of \npost-enactment conduct, namely (1) making payments, di-\nrectly or indirectly, to the designees or families of \n\n211a \n \n \nincarcerated or deceased terrorists, respectively, whose \nacts of terror injured or killed a United States national, or \n(2) undertaking any activities within the United States, \nsubject to a handful of exceptions. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1). These activities within the United States re-\nmained unlawful, but Congress made them a basis for per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA. \nIn both Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization, \n578 F. Supp. 3d 577, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2022), and Sokolow v. \nPalestine Liberation Organization, 590 F. Supp. 3d 589, \n595\u201397 (S.D.N.Y. 2022), the district courts held that the \nPSJVTA was unconstitutional because it was not a valid \nbasis for finding that the PLO and the PA had consented \nto personal jurisdiction in a federal court. In both cases, \nthis Court agreed. See Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n82 F.4th 74, 97\u201398 (2d Cir. 2023) (\u201cFuld\u201d); Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 82 F.4th 64, 73\u201374 (2d Cir. \n2023) (\u201cWaldman III\u201d), aff\u2019g Sokolow, 590 F. Supp. 3d 589. \nThereafter, a majority of the active judges of this Court \nvoted to deny the petition for rehearing en banc. \nThe purpose of this concurrence is not to reprise all of \nthe arguments and analyses in Fuld and Waldman III. \nThose unanimous decisions explain at length the history of \nthese cases and why the PSJVTA is unconstitutional. In-\nstead, the purpose of this concurrence is to respond to the \ncriticisms raised in the dissent from the denial of rehear-\ning en banc. The dissent contends that the panel\u2019s deci-\nsions in Fuld and Waldman III erred in three ways: (1) \nby imposing a new requirement that consent to personal \njurisdiction must be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d; (2) by \nfailing to find that the alleged unlawful activities of the \nPLO and the PA are a basis to find they had consented to \ncivil jurisdiction in United States courts; and (3) by holding \nthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \n\n212a \n \n \nimposes the same limits on personal jurisdiction as the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ex-\ncept that the minimum contacts under the Fourteenth \nAmendment must be with a state and the minimum con-\ntacts under the Fifth Amendment are with the nation. I re-\nspectfully disagree with these arguments and will address \nthem in turn. \nI. \nAs an initial matter, the dissent contends that the gov-\nernment could simply recognize the PA as a state and \nthereby eliminate its constitutional rights. See post, \nMenashi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, \nat 10. However, we addressed that issue in Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Organization, 835 F.3d 317, 329 (2d \nCir. 2016) (\u201cWaldman I\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. Sokolow \nv. Palestine Liberation Org., 584 U.S. 915 (2018), explain-\ning that if the government were to recognize the PA or the \nPLO as a state, they would receive the protection of sover-\neign immunity. These cases would then have to be consid-\nered under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \n(\u201cFSIA\u201d). See id. Moreover, as discussed in Waldman I \nand in Fuld, the Oslo Accords limit the PA\u2019s authority to \nparts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for that reason, \nthe PLO conducts foreign affairs. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at \n322\u201323; see also Fuld, 82 F.4th at 80. Neither the PA nor \nthe PLO is a sovereign government, and there is no dis-\npute that they are entitled to constitutional due process. \nSee Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 329. \nTurning to the merits, the dissent argues that \u201cthe \npanel incorrectly held that Congress may deem a foreign \nentity to have consented to personal jurisdiction based on \nits conduct only if the foreign entity receives a reciprocal \nbenefit.\u201d Post at 2. However, Fuld created no such re-\nquirement. Instead, Fuld described in detail numerous \n\n213a \n \n \ncircumstances that the Supreme Court found \u201cmani-\nfested\u201d consent\u2014 including \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d but also \n\u201clitigation-related activities\u201d and others\u2014 and found that \nthe PSJVTA did not satisfy any of these circumstances. \nSee 82 F.4th at 88\u201390 (citing, inter alia, Mallory v. Norfolk \nS. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023)). Fuld then distinguished \nMallory and other cases involving business registration \nstatutes on the ground that such statutes, unlike the \nPSJVTA, involved reciprocal bargains, but Fuld did not \nsay that consent to jurisdiction can only be found if there \nis a reciprocal bargain. See 82 F.4th at 94\u201396. \nMoreover, contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the \nfacts in Mallory offer no support for the deemed consent \nprovision of the PSJVTA. The PLO and the PA never reg-\nistered to do business in the United States and received \nno benefit for such an action. Congress simply declared \nthat continuing to make certain payments outside the \nUnited States and conducting certain activities in the \nUnited States that were otherwise illegal were sufficient \nto deem the PLO and the PA to have consented to juris-\ndiction in United States courts. Nothing in Mallory sup-\nports that contention. \nRelying primarily on language in plurality opinions in \nMallory, the dissent extrapolates a general principle that \n\u201cdeemed consent statutes are consistent with the Consti-\ntution\u201d and that the \u201cconsent of the foreign entity must only \nbe knowing and voluntary and involve some nexus to the \nforum such that requiring consent would not be \u2018unfair.\u2019\u201d \nPost at 15\u201316 (citing Mallory, 600 U.S. at 141 (plurality \nopinion); id. at 153\u201354 (Alito, J., concurring)). However, \nthat formulation overlooks that the railway company in \nMallory had registered to do business in Pennsylvania \nand, as a condition of doing business, had thereby \n\n214a \n \n \nconsented to jurisdiction to be sued in the state. Justice \nAlito\u2019s concurrence framed the question as follows: \nThe sole question before us is whether the Due Pro-\ncess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is vio-\nlated when a large out-of-state corporation with \nsubstantial operations in a State complies with a \nregistration requirement that conditions the right \nto do business in that State on the registrant\u2019s sub-\nmission to personal jurisdiction in any suits that are \nbrought there. \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 150. Justice Alito concluded that the \nDue Process Clause was not violated by requiring the rail-\nway to be subjected to suit in Pennsylvania, explaining: \nRequiring Norfolk Southern to defend against Mal-\nlory\u2019s suit in Pennsylvania . . . is not so deeply unfair \nthat it violates the railroad\u2019s constitutional right to \ndue process. The company has extensive operations \nin Pennsylvania; has availed itself of the Pennsyl-\nvania courts on countless occasions; and had clear \nnotice that Pennsylvania considered its registration \nas consent to general jurisdiction. Norfolk South-\nern\u2019s conduct and connection with Pennsylvania are \nsuch that it should reasonably anticipate being \nhaled into court there. \nId. at 153 (alterations adopted) (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted). Thus, the business registration \nstatute at issue in Mallory bears no reasonable resem-\nblance to the deemed consent provisions of the PSJVTA. \nThe dissent asserts that the panel opinions impose ad-\nditional requirements beyond that required by principles \nof fundamental fairness, highlighting language in the dis-\ntrict court opinion in Fuld that \u201c[d]efendants do not cite, \nand the Court has not found, any case holding that . . . re-\nceipt of a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Post at 17 \n\n215a \n \n \n(quoting Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 595 n.10). Like the dis-\ntrict court, the panel did not adopt the defendants\u2019 argu-\nment that the receipt of a benefit is a necessary condition \nfor consent. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 96 n.13; Fuld, 578 F. \nSupp. 3d at 595 n.10. Instead, this Court noted that an ex-\nchange of benefits was an important part of the justifica-\ntion for the consent to jurisdiction in business registration \nstatutes, such as the statute at issue in Mallory, but was \nnot required in all cases of consent. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at \n96 n.13 (\u201cThe receipt of a benefit from the forum is not a \nnecessary prerequisite to a finding that a defendant has \nconsented to personal jurisdiction there. . . . There are \nother means of demonstrating consent, such as certain lit-\nigation-related conduct.\u201d). The district court ultimately \nrejected the constitutionality of the PSJVTA for reasons \nsimilar to those discussed by the panel: \nIn the final analysis, the Court cannot acquiesce in \nCongress\u2019s legislative sleight of hand and exercise \njurisdiction over Defendants here pursuant to the \nPSJVTA. A defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary \nconsent is a valid basis to subject it to the jurisdic-\ntion of a court, but Congress cannot simply declare \nanything it wants to be consent. To hold otherwise \nwould let fiction get the better of fact and make a \nmockery of the Due Process Clause. . . . For today\u2019s \npurposes, it suffices to say that the provisions of the \nPSJVTA at issue push the concept of consent well \nbeyond its breaking point and that the predicate \nconduct alleged here is not \u201cof such a nature as to \njustify the fiction\u201d of consent. It follows that exer-\ncising jurisdiction under the facts of this case does \nnot comport with due process . . . . \nFuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d at 595 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945)). \n\n216a \n \n \nThe dissent replaces the carefully balanced legal land-\nscape of constitutional due process with a new standard, \nclaiming that \u201cthe Supreme Court has made clear[] [that] \nconsent based on conduct need only be knowing and vol-\nuntary and have a nexus to the forum.\u201d Post at 3. Mallory, \nhowever, did not establish such a test and does not even \nuse the term \u201cnexus.\u201d Nor does any other Supreme Court \ndecision impute consent to jurisdiction based simply on an \nundefined nexus to the forum. Cf., Ins. Corp. of Ir., 456 \nU.S. at 704; Pa. Fire Ins. Co. v. Gold Issue Mining & 22 \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 94\u201395 (1917). Instead, the dissent \nappears to use the word \u201cnexus\u201d as an umbrella term for \nany activity that Congress might declare subjects a de-\nfendant to the jurisdiction of United States courts. In so \nreasoning, the dissent substitutes the well-established re-\nquirement that consent be knowing and voluntary with the \nconcept that all that is necessary is that a person\u2019s conduct \nbe knowing and voluntary, and that the conduct have some \nrelation to the forum, irrespective of whether the conduct \nreflects consent to jurisdiction in the forum. Adopting the \ndissent\u2019s interpretation would allow the government to de-\nclare conduct to be consent, even if that conduct could not \nreasonably be considered to be consent. Indeed, the dis-\nsent\u2019s new test would allow Congress to subject any for-\neign entity to personal jurisdiction in the United States, \neven in the absence of any contacts with the United States, \nif that entity knowingly and voluntarily engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction in the United States courts. \nThe dissent\u2019s test is contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s \nadmonition against the \u201cdeemed waiver\u201d of constitutional \nrights in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Post-\nsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999). \n\n217a \n \n \nIn that case, the question presented was whether the \nTrademark Remedy Clarification Act (\u201cTRCA\u201d), 106 Stat. \n3567, subjects states to suits brought under Section 43(a) \nof the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). See Coll. Sav. \nBank, 527 U.S. at 668\u201369. Like the PSJVTA, the TRCA \npurported to identify conduct that the targeted actors\u2014\nthe states\u2014could \u201cchoose to abandon.\u201d See id. at 684. The \nstates were then deemed to have \u201cconstructively waived\u201d \ntheir sovereign immunity by engaging in those specified \nactivities. See id. at 683\u201384. The Supreme Court held that \nCongress could not extract \u201cconstructive waivers\u201d of state \nsovereign immunity in this manner, see id. at 683, and that \nsovereign immunity was not abrogated or waived by a \nstate\u2019s participation in interstate commerce, see id. at 691. \nIn College Savings Bank, the Supreme Court did not \nlimit its analysis to issues of sovereign immunity. See \nFuld, 82 F.4th at 99 (citing Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681\u201382). To the contrary, Justice Scalia, writing for the \nmajority, analogized the Eleventh Amendment privilege \nof state sovereign immunity to the Sixth Amendment right \nto trial by jury in criminal cases\u2014concluding that the prin-\nciple of \u201cconstructive waiver\u201d would not apply in either cir-\ncumstance, and that constructive waivers \u201care simply un-\nheard of\u201d in the context of other constitutionally protected \nprivileges. See Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681\u201382. In ad-\ndition, because \u201c\u2018courts indulge every reasonable pre-\nsumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional \nrights,\u201d id. at 682 (alteration omitted) (quoting Aetna Ins. \nCo. v. Kennedy ex rel. Bogash, 301 U.S. 389, 393 (1937)), \nthe Supreme Court concluded that the waiver of state sov-\nereign immunity could not be implied, see id. (citing \nUnited States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)). \nThe PSJVTA\u2019s approach to deemed consent is likewise \n\u201cunheard of\u201d in the context of a waiver of the constitutional \n\n218a \n \n \nright to due process. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 100 (quoting \nColl. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at 681). Indeed, neither the dis-\nsent nor the plaintiffs in these cases have cited any case \ninvolving constructive or deemed consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction under circumstances similar to those in these ac-\ntions. \nThe dissent cites Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Com-\npany of Philadelphia, 243 U.S. 93 (1917), but that case, \nwhich Mallory found to be controlling, involved a Missouri \nbusiness registration statute, like the Pennsylvania busi-\nness registration statute at issue in Mallory. Justice Gor-\nsuch described Pennsylvania Fire as holding that: \u201cPenn-\nsylvania Fire could be sued in Missouri by an out-of-state \nplaintiff on an out- of-state contract because it had agreed \nto accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a \ncondition of doing business there.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n133 (citing Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at 95). There is no similar \nexchange of benefits in the PSJVTA. \nThe dissent attempts to justify the deemed consent \nprovision in this case as \u201csimply the adaptation of tag ju-\nrisdiction to artificial persons and works the same way.\u201d \nPost at 20. Tag jurisdiction recognizes the lawfulness of \njurisdiction based on the service of process on an individ-\nual physically present in the jurisdiction. See Burnham v. \nSuper. Ct. of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S. 604, 610 \n(1990). The Supreme Court has accepted tag jurisdiction \nas a \u201ccontinuing tradition[] of our legal system,\u201d id. at 619, \nbut it is difficult to see that this analogy to tag jurisdiction \nis akin to or can form the basis for imputing the waiver of \na constitutional right. \nIn Burnham, the Supreme Court affirmed the consti-\ntutionality of tag jurisdiction as a \u201ctime-honored ap-\nproach,\u201d which \u201cdates back to the adoption of the Four-\nteenth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 622. However, the Court then \n\n219a \n \n \nmade clear: \u201cFor new procedures, hitherto unknown, the \nDue Process Clause requires analysis to determine \nwhether \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice\u2019 have been offended.\u201d Id. (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co., \n326 U.S. at 316). This Court in Waldman III and Fuld con-\nducted an analysis consistent with International Shoe, \nand for the reasons discussed at length in our opinions, \nconcluded that the PSJVTA\u2019s provision for deemed con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction was inconsistent with the re-\nquirements of constitutional due process. See Waldman \nIII, 82 F.4th at 69. \nAs we explained in Fuld, in a civil case, \u201c[c]onsent to \npersonal jurisdiction is a voluntary agreement on the part \nof a defendant to proceed in a particular forum.\u201d 82 F.4th \nat 87. But neither basis for deemed consent in the PSJVTA \nreflects such an agreement. The first prong\u2014making pay-\nments outside the United States to the designees or fami-\nlies of incarcerated or deceased terrorists\u2014has nothing to \ndo with any alleged agreement by the PLO or the PA to \nbe sued in United States courts. Similarly, the second \nprong of the deemed consent provision\u2014conducting cer-\ntain activities in the United States\u2014does not reflect an \nagreement to be sued in United States courts. Indeed, the \nactivities that Congress described in the PSJVTA are un-\nlawful in the United States. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 93 n.10. \nAccordingly, for the reasons explained in Fuld, the \u201cdec-\nlaration of purported consent, predicated on conduct lack-\ning any of the indicia of valid consent previously recognized \nin the case law, fails to satisfy constitutional due process.\u201d \nId. at 91. \nII. \nThe dissent insists that it is \u201cstrange\u201d that the alleged \nconduct of the PLO and the PA in violation of federal re-\nstrictions would be an insufficient basis to find that they \n\n220a \n \n \nhad not received a benefit in the forum so as to confer ju-\nrisdiction. See post at 22. There is, however, nothing \n\u201cstrange\u201d about that result. Any office other than that \nmaintained pursuant to the United Nations (\u201cUN\u201d) Head-\nquarters Agreement is unlawful, see Fuld, 82 F.4th at 82 \nn.2, and so the defendants have not received any benefit \nfrom the forum, much less one \u201ceven greater\u201d than a for-\neign actor whose domestic activities are not restricted.1 \nPost at 22; see, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5203(a) (authorizing the \nAttorney General to take \u201cthe necessary steps\u201d\u2014 includ-\ning \u201cthe necessary legal action\u201d\u2014to enforce restrictions \nagainst the PLO). The dissent maintains that, in any \nevent, the Executive Branch has essentially conferred a \nbenefit onto the defendants by historically allowing cer-\ntain activities \u201cas a matter of grace.\u201d Post at 22 (quoting \n \n1 Although the dissent correctly notes that the defendants do not ar-\ngue on appeal that their offices and activities in the United States do \nnot meet the second statutory prong of the PSJVTA, it is important to \nemphasize that the failure to make that argument on appeal should not \nbe viewed as a concession by the defendants that they are engaged in \nany illegal conduct in the United States. Instead, as they explained, \nthe district court did not reach that issue. See Appellees\u2019 Fuld Br. at \n48 n.20; Appellees\u2019 Waldman Br. at 50 n.24. Moreover, the defendants \ndid argue below that their alleged activities in the United States are ex-\nempt from consideration under the PSJVTA as part of their UN mis-\nsion and UN- related activities, and \u201cany personal or official activities \nconducted ancillary\u201d thereto. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3); see also Fuld, 82 \nF.4th at 85 n.4. In particular, as explained in their appellate briefs, \nthe defendants argued in the district court that, \u201c[a]s part of its UN \nactivities, the Palestinian Mission participates in the work of the UN \nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestin-\nian People (\u2018CEIRPP\u2019). In light of the CEIRPP\u2019s work, the \u2018political \npropaganda activities and proselytizing,\u2019 press conferences, and Inter-\nnet and social media posts alleged in the Amended Complaint are all \nplainly either official UN business or \u2018ancillary to\u2019 such activities un-\nder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3).\u201d Appellees\u2019 Fuld Br. at 48 n.20 (citations \nomitted); see also Appellees\u2019 Waldman Br. at 50 n.24. \n\n221a \n \n \nFuld, 82 F. 4th 93 at n.10). As an initial matter, the dissent \ncites no case law to support the proposition that executive \nnonenforcement, the result of political considerations, \nshould impact the Court\u2019s constitutional due process anal-\nysis. Moreover, \u201cfederal law has long prohibited the de-\nfendants from engaging in any activities or maintaining \nany offices in the United States, absent specific executive \nor statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. \u201cThe PSJVTA \ndoes not purport to relax or override these prohibitions,\u201d \nand the parties did not identify \u201cany other change in exist-\ning law (for example, a statutory or executive waiver) that \nwould otherwise authorize the restricted conduct.\u201d2 Id. \nSo long as the PLO and the PA are prohibited from \nconducting business in the United States other than as al-\nlowed by the UN Headquarters Agreement, to establish \ndeemed consent to jurisdiction based on those activities is \nto use the denial of a due process right as a penalty for \nunlawful conduct. The Supreme Court has specifically \ncautioned against that result. See Fuld, 82 F.4th at 94. In \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court held that a \ndiscovery sanction against the defendant establishing the \nfacts of jurisdiction did not violate due process because \nthere was a presumption that the evidence that was wrong-\nfully withheld established personal jurisdiction. 456 U.S. \nat 705\u201306. The Supreme Court made clear that \u201cthe per-\nsonal jurisdiction requirement recognizes and protects an \nindividual liberty interest.\u201d Id. at 702. The Supreme \nCourt found that it did not violate due process to invoke a \npresumption that the refusal to produce evidence material \n \n2 To the extent that the dissent suggests that specific jurisdiction \nmight lie where a nonresident defendant \u201charms\u201d the forum by engag-\ning in illicit activities in the forum, see post at 22, this suggestion has no \nbearing on the Court\u2019s analysis regarding the consent theory of juris-\ndiction, which is the only theory of jurisdiction being litigated in these \ncases. \n\n222a \n \n \nto the administration of due process was an admission of \nthe lack of merit of that defense. Id. at 705. However, the \nCourt distinguished that presumption from the situation \nin Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897), in which the Court \nheld that it \u201cviolate[d] due process for a court to take simi-\nlar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey an order to \npay into the registry of the court a certain sum of money.\u201d \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 706. \nIn this case, establishing deemed-consent jurisdiction \nbased on the alleged unlawful activities undertaken by the \nPLO and the PA in the United States would be nothing \nmore than \u201cpunishment\u201d for such conduct.3 And nothing \nabout that conduct suggests that the PLO and the PA have \nconsented to be sued in United States courts. Instead, as \nwe explained in Fuld, \u201cthe [PSJVTA] subjects the defend-\nants to the authority of the federal courts for engaging in \nconduct with no connection to the establishment of per-\nsonal jurisdiction, and indeed with no connection to litiga-\ntion in the United States at all.\u201d 82 F.4th at 94. \n \n3 The dissent suggests that the second prong of the PSJVTA is not a \npenalty for unlawful conduct, but rather \u201csimply subjects each defend-\nant to the jurisdiction of the federal courts by virtue of its conduct in \nthe forum.\u201d Post at 24. However, it is uncontroverted that the alleged \nillegal conduct that would create jurisdiction under the second prong \nis wholly unrelated to the alleged activities giving rise to liability in \nthe underlying lawsuits. The dissent\u2019s analysis blurs the require-\nments for exercising personal jurisdiction through specific jurisdic-\ntion and the requirements for exercising personal jurisdiction through \nconsent. In the proceedings before the district court in Fuld, the \nplaintiffs never contended that the court had specific jurisdiction over \nthe PLO and the PA. See 82 F.4th at 87. Moreover, this Court in \nWaldman I concluded that there was no specific jurisdiction over the \nPLO and the PA. See 835 F.3d at 335\u201337. The underlying acts of ter-\nrorism occurred outside the United States and were not targeted \nagainst United States nationals.  \n\n223a \n \n \nIn sum, under the consent theory of jurisdiction chosen \nby Congress, there is no principled way to deny the PLO \nand the PA the due process rights they have consistently \nasserted.4 \nIII. \nFinally, the dissent urges that the standard for deter-\nmining the constitutionality of exercising personal juris-\ndiction under the Fifth Amendment should not be the \nsame as under the Fourteenth Amendment. See post at \n26\u201334. Recognizing that the Supreme Court has \u201creserved \njudgment\u201d on this question, id. at 26 (citing Bristol-Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017)), \nthe dissent contends that \u201cthe facts of these cases\u201d require \nthis Court to overturn its previous decisions, see id. at 35. \nAs we noted in Waldman I, for over forty years, this Court \nhas repeatedly held that there is a \u201ccongruence of due pro-\ncess analysis under both the Fourteenth and Fifth Amend-\nments,\u201d and \u201chas applied Fourteenth Amendment princi-\nples to Fifth Amendment civil terrorism cases.\u201d 835 F.3d \nat 330 (collecting cases). \nThe dissent seeks to overturn our well-established law \nbased on some scholarship to the effect that \u201coutside of the \nlimits imposed by service of process, a federal court\u2019s writ \nmay run as far as Congress, within its enumerated powers, \nwould have it go.\u201d Post at 28 (alteration adopted) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). However, the \n \n4 Although the dissent states that the \u201cconcurrence believes it would \nbe improper for Congress to punish the unlawful conduct of the PLO \nand the PA,\u201d post at 24, I reach no such conclusion, nor did the panel \nopinions. Instead, the panel opinions narrowly held that Congress \ncould not use this particular jurisdictional mechanism under these cir-\ncumstances to bypass the due process rights that otherwise exist in \nthis civil context. As discussed infra, many tools are available under \nthe broad powers of Congress to address alleged unlawful conduct of \nthis nature. \n\n224a \n \n \nscholarship cited in the dissent is insufficient to explain \nwhy actions in federal courts implicate individual liberty in-\nterests any less than those in state courts. As the Supreme \nCourt has emphasized: \nThe requirement that a court have personal juris-\ndiction flows not from Art. III, but from the Due \nProcess Clause. The personal jurisdiction require-\nment recognizes and protects an individual liberty \ninterest. It represents a restriction on judicial \npower not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a mat-\nter of individual liberty. \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 702. In my view, especially in \nthe absence of any intervening applicable Supreme Court \ndecision, the recent scholarship cited by the dissent does \nnot provide a sufficient basis, under principles of stare \ndecisis, to depart from a constitutional rule that has ex-\nisted in our Circuit for over forty years and has been re-\naffirmed numerous times without intervention by our en \nbanc Court. See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 36 F.3d 106, \n110 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (en banc) (\u201c[B]ecause [our prece-\ndent] represents the established law of the circuit, a due \nregard for the value of stability in the law requires that we \nhave good and sufficient reason to reject it at this late \ndate.\u201d); Robert Bosch, LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp., 719 F.3d \n1305, 1316\u201317 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (en banc) (emphasizing the \nimportance of stare decisis when an en banc court consid-\ners adopting a position contrary to longstanding panel \nprecedent); United States v. Heredia, 483 F.3d 913, 918 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (\u201cOverturning a long-standing precedent is \nnever to be done lightly   \u201d); accord Al-Sharif v. U.S. \nCitizenship and Immig. Servs., 734 F.3d 207, 212 (3d Cir. \n2013) (en banc). \nIndeed, this Court\u2019s decisions, in both Waldman I and \nFuld, which followed clear and longstanding precedent \n\n225a \n \n \nfrom this Court, are consistent with the conclusion \nreached by each of the six other federal courts of appeals \nthat has addressed this specific question. Fuld, 82 F.4th \nat 103\u201304, 104 n.17 (collecting cases); Waldman I, 835 F.3d \nat 330; see also Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kai-\nsha, 46 F.4th 226, 235 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cBoth Due \nProcess Clauses use the same language and serve the \nsame purpose, protecting individual liberty by guarantee-\ning limits on personal jurisdiction.\u201d), cert. denied sub nom. \nDouglass v. Kaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023); Livnat v. Pal-\nestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 54\u201355 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (noting \nthat the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh, and Federal \nCircuits have expressly analyzed whether the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendment standards differ and \u201call agree \nthat there is no meaningful difference in the level of con-\ntacts required for personal jurisdiction\u201d). \nMoreover, it is unclear from the dissent whether the \nentire body of Fourteenth Amendment personal jurisdic-\ntion jurisprudence would be jettisoned in Fifth Amend-\nment cases, and if so, what would replace it. Would all de-\nfendants in federal courts, irrespective of the nature of the \nlawsuits against them, be denied the right to assert that \nhaling them into federal court is unreasonable? See \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472 (\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause \n\u2018gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that \nallows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that \nconduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. \n286, 297 (1980))). It is precisely this type of uncertainty \nthat the dissent\u2019s proposed approach would engender \nacross the personal jurisdiction landscape that strongly \ncounsels against en banc review to eliminate our \nlongstanding precedent in the absence of any intervening \nSupreme Court decision or guidance from the highest \n\n226a \n \n \ncourt in the land as to what the new constitutional param-\neters would be. \nFinally, the dissent suggests that our holding in these \ncases \u201cleaves Congress powerless to afford relief to Amer-\nican victims of international terrorism.\u201d Post at 38\u201339. I \nrespectfully disagree. In fact, the United States Depart-\nment of Justice, in opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to the \nSupreme Court for a writ of certiorari in Waldman I, also \ndisagreed with any such suggestion. More specifically, in \nthe certiorari petition, plaintiffs urged the Supreme Court \nto review our decision in Waldman I because, inter alia, \nthe application of Fourteenth Amendment personal- juris-\ndiction standards in cases governed by the Fifth Amend-\nment purportedly \u201cimperil[ed] Congress\u2019s ability to pro-\ntect Americans from international terrorism and other un-\nlawful acts abroad.\u201d Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 34, \nSokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 16-1071 (Mar. \n3, 2017), 2017 WL 913120, at *34. The Department of Jus-\ntice, however, disagreed with that assessment and plain-\ntiffs\u2019 corresponding effort to overturn our approach to per-\nsonal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment (and that of \nsix of our sister circuits), explaining: \nIt is far from clear that the court of appeals\u2019 ap-\nproach will foreclose many claims that would other-\nwise go forward in federal courts. As the court of \nappeals explained, its approach permits U.S. courts \nto exercise jurisdiction over defendants accused of \ntargeting U.S. citizens in an act of international ter-\nrorism. It permits U.S. courts to exercise jurisdic-\ntion if the United States was the focal point of the \nharm caused by the defendant\u2019s participation in or \nsupport for overseas terrorism.  And the court of \nappeals stated that it would permit U.S. courts to \nexercise jurisdiction over defendants alleged to \n\n227a \n \n \nhave purposefully availed themselves of the privi-\nlege of conducting activity in the United States, by, \nfor example, making use of U.S. financial institu-\ntions to support international terrorism. In addi-\ntion, nothing in the court\u2019s opinion calls into ques-\ntion the United States\u2019 ability to prosecute defend-\nants under the broader due process principles the \ncourts have recognized in cases involving the appli-\ncation of U.S. criminal laws to conduct affecting \nU.S. citizens or interests. Under these circum-\nstances, in the absence of any conflict or even a de-\nveloped body of law addressing petitioners\u2019 rela-\ntively novel theory, this Court\u2019s intervention is not \nwarranted. \nBrief for the United States as Amicus Curiae at 17\u201318, \nSokolow v.

Instead, the question \nis whether Congress can seek to accomplish those im-\nportant objectives through one particular jurisdictional \nmechanism\u2014namely, by attempting to twist the doctrine \nof deemed consent, for purposes of establishing personal \njurisdiction over foreign entities in civil cases, beyond \nrecognition under the current due process jurisprudence of \nthis Court and the Supreme Court.

Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) \n(Holmes, J.). In these cases, Congress adopted and the \nPresident signed the legislation \u201cin furtherance of their \nstance on a matter of foreign policy,\u201d and \u201c[a]ction in that \nrealm warrants respectful review by courts.\u201d Bank \nMarkazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016). Not only \nthat, but the legislation was enacted specifically to over-\ncome the panel\u2019s two prior dismissals of the plaintiffs\u2019 law-\nsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Waldman I, 835 \nF.3d 317; Waldman v. PLO (Waldman II), 925 F.3d 570 \n(2d Cir. 2019). Congress has now deliberately and une-\nquivo cally authorized the federal courts to entertain this \nlawsuit, but the panel dismissed it for a third time. \nAccording to the panel, Congress may \u201crequire sub-\nmission to federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d only \u201cin exchange \nfor, or as a condition of, receiving some in-forum benefit or \nprivilege.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 91. The PLO and the PA knew \nthat supporting terrorists who killed or injured Americans \nand maintaining an office and conducting activities in the \nUnited States would subject them to the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts; the organizations knowingly and voluntar-\nily engaged in that conduct anyway. But the panel never-\ntheless concluded that subjecting the PLO and the PA to \nfederal court jurisdiction \u201ccannot be reconciled with \u2018tradi-\ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n101 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Off. of Unem-\nployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). \nThe panel\u2019s decision lacks a basis in the Constitution \nand cannot be reconciled with Supreme Court precedent \non personal jurisdiction. The decision rests on three legal \n\n231a \n \n \nerrors. First, the panel incorrectly held that Congress \nmay deem a foreign entity to have consented to personal \njurisdiction based on its conduct only if the foreign entity \nreceives a reciprocal benefit. Id. at 91. No law requires \nCongress to extend a benefit to those over whom it author-\nizes personal jurisdiction. Instead, as the Supreme Court \nhas made clear, consent based on conduct need only be \nknowing and voluntary and have a nexus to the forum. In \nMallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., the Supreme \nCourt held that Pennsylvania may deem, via statute, an \nout-of-state corporation\u2019s registration to do business to be \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania. 600 U.S. \n122, 127 (2023). \u201cHaving made the choice to register and do \nbusiness in Pennsylvania, despite the jurisdictional conse-\nquences (and having thereby voluntarily relinquished the \ndue process rights our general- jurisdiction precedents af-\nford), Norfolk Southern cannot be heard to complain that \nits due process rights are violated by having to defend it-\nself in Pennsylvania\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at 149 (Jackson, J., con-\ncurring). The PLO and the PA similarly chose to take ac-\ntions with a nexus to the United States knowing the juris-\ndictional consequences. \nSecond, even if the panel were correct that the Due \nProcess Clause required a reciprocal benefit, the statute \nhere involves such a benefit because the defendants are \ndeemed to have consented based on the privilege of resid-\ning and conducting business in the United States\u2014not to \nmention furthering their political goals at the expense of \nAmerican lives. The panel claimed that the conduct of busi-\nness by the PLO and the PA in the United States does not \namount to a benefit because \u201cfederal law has long prohib-\nited the defendants from engaging in any activities or \nmaintaining any offices in the United States, absent spe-\ncific executive or statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. \nBut it is perverse to suggest that a foreign entity may \n\n232a \n \n \nunlawfully extract a benefit from the forum and receive \nconstitutional protection from personal jurisdiction while \na foreign entity conducting lawful activities in the forum \ndoes not receive such protection. \nThird, the panel held that the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment imposes the same limits on the juris-\ndiction of the federal courts that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the jurisdiction \nof the state courts. Id. at 102-05. The Supreme Court has \nexpressly left \u201copen the question whether the Fifth \nAmendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction by a federal court\u201d as the Four-\nteenth Amendment imposes on a state court. Bristol-My-\ners Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 \n(2017).2 I would hold that the federal government is not \nsimilarly situated to the state governments in the extrater-\nritorial reach of its courts. For that reason, the due pro-\ncess standards limiting the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nare not the same. \nThese cases involve a \u201cquestion of exceptional im-\nportance,\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2), because Congress has \nadopted legislation making clear the policy of the federal \ngovernment that the PLO and the PA should be subject to \n \n2 The Supreme Court has not reached the issue of the Fifth Amend-\nment Due Process Clause\u2014even though it has considered the reach \nof personal jurisdiction in the federal courts\u2014because the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure generally limit personal jurisdiction in the \nfederal courts \u201cto the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in \nthe state where the district is located.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). For \nthat reason, the case law regarding personal jurisdiction in the federal \ncourts applies the Fourteenth Amendment standards applicable to the \nstates. See, e.g., Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014) \n(\u201cFederal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds \nof their jurisdiction over persons.\u201d). It is important to note, however, \nthat the federal rules also allow personal jurisdiction to be established \n\u201cwhen authorized by a federal statute.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C). \n\n233a \n \n \npersonal jurisdiction in the federal courts. The panel, how-\never, held that the Constitution prohibits Congress from \npursuing that policy. Invaliding an act of Congress would \nentail a question of exceptional importance on its own.3 But \nthese cases also involve (1) significant questions about con-\nstitutional limits on the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \n(2) judicial deference to the political branches in the realm \nof foreign affairs, and (3) the invalidation of a jury verdict \nand award under the ATA. We should have reheard these \ncases en banc. \nBACKGROUND \nThe panel decision in these cases resulted from an ex-\ntended back-and-forth between the panel and Congress. \nThe plaintiffs brought suit under the ATA\u2014which pro-\nvides a remedy against \u201cany person who aids and abets\u201d a \nterrorist attack \u201cby knowingly providing substantial as-\nsistance\u201d  to  the perpetrator, 18  U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(d)(2)\u2014\nand sought damages from the PLO and the PA for \nterrorist attacks that killed or wounded themselves or \ntheir family members. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 322. The \n \n3 The invalidation of a federal statute is a primary reason for the Su-\npreme Court to grant a petition for certiorari. See, e.g., Allen v. Cooper, \n589 U.S. 248, 254 (2020) (\u201cBecause the Court of Appeals held a federal \nstatute invalid, this Court granted certiorari.\u201d); Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 \nU.S. 388, 392 (2019) (\u201cAs usual when a lower court has invalidated a \nfederal statute, we granted certiorari.\u201d); United States v. Kebodeaux, \n570 U.S. 387, 391 (2013) (\u201c[I]n light of the fact that a Federal Court of \nAppeals has held a federal statute unconstitutional, we granted the \npetition.\u201d); United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 605 (2000) (\u201cBe-\ncause the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal statute on constitu-\ntional grounds, we granted certiorari.\u201d); United States v. Edge Broad. \nCo., 509 U.S. 418, 425 (1993) (\u201cBecause the court below declared a fed-\neral statute unconstitutional and applied reasoning that was question-\nable under our cases \u2026 we granted certiorari.\u201d); see also Tejas N. \nNarechania, Certiorari in Important Cases, 122 Colum. L. Rev. 923, \n927-28 (2022). \n\n234a \n \n \ndistrict court held that it had personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendants, and after a trial \u201ca jury found that the defend-\nants, acting through their employees, perpetrated the at-\ntacks and that the defendants knowingly provided mate-\nrial support to organizations designated by the United \nStates State Department as foreign terrorist organiza-\ntions.\u201d Id. The jury awarded damages of $218.5 million, \ntrebled pursuant to the ATA to $655.5 million. Id.4 \nThe panel overturned the jury verdict and dismissed \nthe case in 2016, holding that the district court lacked per-\nsonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA. Waldman I, \n835 F.3d at 337. The panel concluded that the test for per-\nsonal jurisdiction \u201cis the same under the Fifth Amend-\nment and the Fourteenth Amendment in civil cases\u201d and \napplied the traditional Fourteenth Amendment personal \njurisdiction test to the reach of the federal courts. Id. at \n331. The panel held that the district court lacked general \npersonal jurisdiction because the PLO and the PA were \n\u201cfairly regarded as at home\u201d in the Palestinian territories \nand not in New York, id. at 332 (quoting Daimler, 571 U.S. \nat 137), and that there was no specific personal jurisdiction \n \n4 The jury made findings regarding the defendants\u2019 involvement in \nseveral different terrorist attacks. For example, with respect to Ha-\nmas\u2019s bombing of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem on July 31, \n2002, the jury found that the defendants \u201cknowingly provided material \nsupport or resources that were used in preparation for or in carrying \nout this attack\u201d; that \u201can employee of the PA, acting within the scope \nof his employment and in furtherance of the activities of the PA, either \ncarried out, or knowingly provided material support,\u201d for the attack; \nthat both the PLO and the PA knowingly provided material support \nto Hamas following its designation as a foreign terrorist organization; \nand that both defendants \u201charbored or concealed a person who the [de-\nfendants] knew, or had reasonable grounds to believe, committed or \nwas about to commit this attack.\u201d Jury Verdict Form at 5-6, Sokolow \nv. PLO, No. 04-CV-00397 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2015), ECF No. 825. \n\n235a \n \n \nbecause the terrorist attacks \u201cwere not sufficiently con-\nnected to the United States,\u201d id. at 337.5 \nIn response to Waldman I, Congress enacted the Anti-\nTerrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), which pro-\nvided that a defendant will be \u201cdeemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction\u201d if, after 120 days, it receives cer-\ntain forms of American assistance or has its headquarters \nor office under United States jurisdiction. Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, \u00a7 4(a). The plaintiffs requested that the panel recall \nthe Waldman I mandate given the new statute, but the \npanel rejected that request because the plaintiffs had \u201cnot \nshown that either factual predicate of Section 4 of the \nATCA has been satisfied\u201d with respect to the PLO or the \nPA. Waldman II, 925 F.3d at 574. \nIn response to Waldman II, Congress acted again. \nCongress enacted, and the President signed, the Promot-\ning Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of \n2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d). The PSJVTA, codified in relevant part \nat 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e), left no ambiguity that Congress in-\ntended to subject the PLO and the PA to the jurisdiction \nof the federal courts based on voluntary contacts with the \nUnited States. The statute expressly defines \u201cdefendant\u201d \n \n5 The district court\u2019s decision on personal jurisdiction occurred prior \nto Daimler, 571 U.S. 117, and Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277 (2014), \nwhich limited general personal jurisdiction over foreign corporations \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior \nto these cases, federal courts exercised personal jurisdiction in terror-\nism cases such as these. See, e.g., Est. of Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., \n82 F. Supp. 3d 237, 239 (D.D.C. 2015) (\u201cIn 2006, the Court determined \nthat it could exercise general personal jurisdiction over the PA and \nPLO based on their \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the \nUnited States.\u201d); Mwani v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2005). \nThe Waldman I panel relied on Daimler to reject this earlier consen-\nsus. Neither Daimler nor Walden, however, involved the Fifth \nAmendment or a congressional enactment expressly authorizing per-\nsonal jurisdiction. \n\n236a \n \n \nto include the PLO, the PA, or any successor or affiliate \nof these entities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5). It also provides \nnew factual predicates that are considered consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in American courts for ATA suits. Any \n\u201cdefendant\u201d\u2014that is, the PLO or the PA\u2014\u201cshall be \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction \u2026 if \u2026 \nthe defendant\u201d: \n(A) [after 120 days following enactment] makes any \npayment, directly or indirectly\u2014 \n(i) to any payee designated by any individual who, \nafter being fairly tried or pleading guilty, has been \nimprisoned for committing any act of terrorism \nthat injured or killed a national of the United \nStates, if such payment is made by reason of such \nimprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, follow-\ning such individual\u2019s death while committing an act \nof terrorism that injured or killed a national of the \nUnited States, if such payment is made by reason \nof the death of such individual; or \n(B) after 15 days [following enactment]\u2014 \n(i) continues to maintain any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in \nthe United States; \n(ii) establishes or procures any office, headquar-\nters, premises, or other facilities or establish-\nments in the United States; or \n(iii) conducts any activity while physically present \nin the United States on behalf of the Palestine Lib-\neration Organization or the Palestinian Authority. \n\n237a \n \n \nId. \u00a7 2334(e)(1).6 The statute provides that engaging in ei-\nther of these two conduct predicates\u2014payments for ter-\nrorism or premises or activities in the United States\u2014\nqualifies as consent to personal jurisdiction. \nThe plaintiffs allege that both prongs of \u00a7 2334(e)(1) \nare met. The PLO and the PA continued past the 120-day \nnotice period to make payments to both the designees and \nfamily members of terrorists who committed acts of ter-\nrorism that killed or injured American nationals.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-95; Fuld, 82 F.4th at 84. In these \nappeals, neither the defendants nor the panel disputed \nthat the PLO and the PA engaged in the relevant conduct \nto be covered by the PSJVTA. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 85-86.7  \nThe panel nevertheless affirmed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand held that both prongs of \u00a7 2334(e) are unconstitutional \nbecause the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 101. \nDISCUSSION \nThe panel opinion invokes the purportedly fundamen-\ntal \u201cliberty interest\u201d of the PLO and the PA that \u201cflow[s] \nfrom the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of due process\u201d and \n\u201censures that a court will exercise personal jurisdiction \n \n6 The statute exempts activities such as the conduct of business at \nthe United Nations. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). \n7 In any event, on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwe must \u201cconstrue the pleadings \u2026 in the light most favorable to [the \nplaintiffs], resolving all doubts in [their] favor.\u201d DiStefano v. Carozzi \nN.

Azerbaijan Corp. \nv. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 400 \n(2d Cir. 2009). So if tomorrow the Department of State rec-\nognized the PA as the sovereign government of \u201cPales-\ntine\u201d\u2014as the defendants believe it is\u2014then there would \nbe no question at all that the PSJVTA is constitutional and \nthat the Due Process Clause is not implicated.9 Funda-\nmental constitutional rights are not typically so contin-\ngent.10 \n \n8 See Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the \nUnited Nations, Diplomatic Relations, https://perma.cc/E5JB-\nSLZK. \n9 Cf.

I do not see how it \ndoes. \nTo correct the errors of the panel opinion, I would \nhold that \n(1) under the Fourteenth Amendment standards for \npersonal jurisdiction, a legislature does not need to provide \na reciprocal benefit to a foreign entity to subject that entity \nto personal jurisdiction based on knowing and voluntary \nconduct with a nexus to the forum, \n(2) even if there were a reciprocal benefit requirement, \nthe PLO and the PA benefited from conducting business \nin the United States, and \n(3) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not impose the same limits on the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts that the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment imposes on the state courts. Given any \none of these conclusions, the district court may exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in these \ncases. \nI \nThere is no requirement that a statutory provision that \ndeems certain conduct to signify consent to personal juris-\ndiction must be based on \u201creciprocal bargains.\u201d Fuld, 82 \nF.4th at 90.11 Even assuming that constitutional due \n \n11 The concurrence denies that the panel opinion created a recipro-\ncal- bargain requirement\u2014even though it simultaneously distin-\nguishes Mallory on the ground that it \u201cinvolved reciprocal bargains\u201d \nand explains that the PSJVTA is unconstitutional because the PLO \nand the PA \u201creceived no benefit,\u201d \u201chave not received any benefit in \nthe forum,\u201d and participated in \u201cno similar exchange of benefits.\u201d Ante \nat 6, 13, 15. The purported denial is simply the observation that con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction may be achieved through other means not \nrelevant here, such as \u201clitigation-related activities.\u201d Id. at 6. No one dis-\nputes that point. But the panel opinion clearly invented a new re-\nquirement that applies when Congress or a state legislature \n\n241a \n \n \nprocess limits the ability of federal courts to exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction, the PSJVTA does not conflict with due \nprocess because it establishes personal jurisdiction if a de-\nfendant knowingly and voluntarily undertakes actions \nwith a nexus to the forum. The panel erred in concluding \notherwise. \nA \nThe Supreme Court recently decided Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk Southern Railway Co., in which the Court considered \n\u201cwhether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment prohibits a State from requiring an out-of-\nstate corporation to consent to personal jurisdiction to do \nbusiness there,\u201d as Pennsylvania had done. 600 U.S. at \n127. The Supreme Court said that the Pennsylvania stat-\nute was constitutional. Five justices noted that the case \nwas controlled by earlier precedent in which the Court had \nsaid that \u201cthere was \u2018no doubt\u2019\u201d a company \u201ccould be sued \nin Missouri by an out-of-state plaintiff on an out-of- state \ncontract because it had agreed to accept service of process \nin Missouri on any suit as a condition of doing business \nthere.\u201d Id. at 133 (plurality opinion) (quoting Pa. Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 95 \n(1917)). Those five justices agreed that consent was an in-\ndependent basis for jurisdiction; because the require-\nments of International Shoe apply only to \u201can out-of-state \ncorporation that has not consented to in-state suits,\u201d those \nrequirements were inapplicable.

Com-\npagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 704-05 \n(1982)), and indeed \u201ca variety of legal arrangements have \n \n12 Justice Alito, in a separate concurrence, recognized that Pennsyl-\nvania Fire remained good law and that there was no due process prob-\nlem because \u201cthe defendant had consented to jurisdiction in the forum \nState.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 156 (Alito, J.). He wrote separately to \nraise the concern that a \u201cState\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over lawsuits \nwith no real connection to the State\u201d may undermine \u201cthe federal sys-\ntem that the Constitution created.\u201d Id. at 150. Justice Alito observed \nthat \u201cthe most appropriate home for these principles is the so-called \ndormant Commerce Clause\u201d rather than the Due Process Clause. Id. \nThese concerns about federalism and the dormant Commerce Clause \ndo not apply to a federal statute extending the reach of the federal \ncourts. \n\n243a \n \n \nbeen taken to represent express or implied consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction consistent with due process,\u201d id. at 136 \nn.5 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks and alter-\nation omitted). The defendant need not specifically intend \nto consent to jurisdiction but need only take a \u201cvoluntary \nact\u201d that the law treats as consent. Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at \n96.13 The \u201cprecedents approving other forms of consent to \npersonal jurisdiction have [n]ever imposed some sort of \n\u2018magic words\u2019 requirement\u201d or required a particular for-\nmula. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5 (majority opinion). \nThe Supreme Court has thus explained that deemed-\nconsent statutes are consistent with the Constitution and \nlimited only by the sovereign reach of the forum state, as \nillustrated by the analogy to tag jurisdiction. The panel, \nhowever, artificially constrained the power of a legislature \nto adopt such a statute to two narrow circumstances: (1) \n\u201clitigation-related conduct\u201d or (2) \u201cwhere a defendant ac-\ncepts a benefit from the forum in exchange for its amena-\nbility to suit in the forum\u2019s courts.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 88. \nLimiting the power of Congress or a state legislature to \nthese stylized circumstances conflicts with Mallory. \nThe consent of the foreign entity must only be knowing \nand voluntary and involve some nexus to the forum such \n \n13 See Smolik v. Phila. & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 222 F. 148, 151 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1915) (L. Hand, J.) (\u201cWhen it is said that a foreign corpora-\ntion will be taken to have consented to the appointment of an agent to \naccept service, the court does not mean that as a fact it has consented \nat all, because the corporation does not in fact consent; but the court, \nfor purposes of justice, treats it as if it had. It is true that the conse-\nquences so imputed to it lie within its own control, since it need not do \nbusiness within the state, but that is not equivalent to a consent; actu-\nally it might have refused to appoint, and yet its refusal would make \nno difference. The court, in the interests of justice, imputes results to \nthe voluntary act of doing business within the foreign state, quite in-\ndependently of any intent.\u201d). \n\n244a \n \n \nthat requiring consent would not be \u201cunfair.\u201d Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion); id. at 153-54 (Alito, J.). The \nPennsylvania law at issue in Mallory did not involve an ac-\ntual bargain or a \u201cvoluntary agreement,\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at \n87, between the state and each company. Rather, Norfolk \nSouthern was deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction from the fact of it having registered under 15 \nPa. Stat. \u00a7 411(a). That is because a separate statute treats \n\u201c\u2018qualification as a foreign corporation\u2019 to be a \u2018sufficient \nbasis\u2019 for Pennsylvania courts \u2018to exercise general per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u2019 over an out-of-state company.\u201d Mal-\nlory, 600 U.S. at 151 (Alito, J.) (quoting 42 Pa. Stat. \n\u00a7 5301(a)(2)(i) (2019)). Neither statute indicated that per-\nsonal jurisdiction was being exchanged for the benefit of \noperating in Pennsylvania; the statutes did not even refer-\nence each other.14 Instead, like the PSJVTA, the statute \n\u201csimply declared that specific activities\u201d such as register-\ning to do business in the state sufficed to establish per-\nsonal jurisdiction. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 97. In this way, con-\ntrary to the suggestion of the concurrence, the statute \nbears a \u201creasonable resemblance to the deemed consent \nprovisions of the PSJVTA.\u201d Ante at 8. \n \n14 It is true that the Mallory opinions mention an \u201cexchange.\u201d 600 \nU.S. at 130 (plurality opinion); id. at 151 (Alito, J.). But the Court did \nnot hold that such an exchange was required, and the description of \ndeemed-consent statutes as analogous to tag jurisdiction demon-\nstrates that it was not. The Court referenced the notion of exchange \nonly to respond to the argument of Norfolk Southern that enforcing \nPennsylvania\u2019s statute would be \u201cunfair.\u201d Id. at 141-43 (plurality opin-\nion); id. at 153 (Alito, J.). The plurality said: \u201c[I]f fairness is what Nor-\nfolk Southern seeks, pause for a moment to measure this suit against \nthat standard.\u201d Id. at 141 (plurality opinion). The circumstances of this \ncase similarly evince no unfairness to the PLO and the PA in requiring \ntravel from the offices those entities maintain in the United States to \nanswer for violations of the Anti-Terrorism Act. \n\n245a \n \n \n\u201cNorfolk Southern is a sophisticated entity, and we \nmay \u2018presume\u2019 that it \u2018acted with knowledge\u2019 of state law \nwhen it registered\u201d and, consequently, \u201cby registering, it \nconsented to all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 151 (Alito, J.) (alteration omitted) \n(quoting Com. Mut. Accident Co. v. Davis, 213 U.S. 245, \n254 (1909)). Norfolk Southern consented to general per-\nsonal jurisdiction by taking a voluntary action in connection \nwith the forum with knowledge that state law deemed the \naction to be consent. The PLO and the PA each also acted \nvoluntarily with knowledge that its actions would subject \nit to the jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nIn neither case was there an actual \u201cvoluntary agree-\nment on the part of a defendant to proceed in a particular \nforum.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 87. But that is not required. The \ndistrict court was correct that \u201cDefendants do not cite, and \nthe Court has not found, any case holding that \u2026 receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Fuld, 578 F. Supp. 3d \nat 595 n.10. Rather, the cases emphasize the knowing and \nvoluntary nature of the conduct. See Pa.

Knowing that it would be deemed consent to \nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts, the PLO and the PA \ncontinued making covered payments after the 120- day pe-\nriod specified in the PSJVTA. There is a nexus to the fo-\nrum because the payments compensated terrorists for at-\ntacks that killed or injured American nationals. Fuld Am. \nCompl. \u00b6 44.16 It is not \u201cunfair\u201d for Congress to require a \nforeign entity to consent to the jurisdiction of the federal \ncourts when the entity compensated terrorists who killed \nAmericans with the knowledge that such compensation \nwould be considered consent to jurisdiction. Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion). \nThe second prong of the PSJVTA is even more clearly \npermissible because it parallels the statute upheld \nin Mallory. Congress may require consent to jurisdiction \nas a condition of maintaining offices and conducting \n \n15 See also Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68 (1938) (\u201cThe plaintiff \nhaving, by his voluntary act in demanding justice from the defendant, \nsubmitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court, there is nothing ar-\nbitrary or unreasonable in treating him as being there for all purposes \nfor which justice to the defendant requires his presence.\u201d); Leman v. \nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U.S. 448, 451 (1932) (noting that \nby bringing suit, the plaintiff \u201csubmitted itself to the jurisdiction of \nthe court with respect to \u2026 the counterclaim of the defendants\u201d). \n16 The PLO and the PA are aware that the United States opposes \nthese payments. Prior to 2018, the United States gave the PLO and \nthe PA hundreds of millions of dollars, but starting in 2018, pursuant \nto the Taylor Force Act, the United States ended such assistance un-\nless the PLO and the PA terminated the payments.

The PLO and the PA, as \u201cso-\nphisticated entit[ies],\u201d understood that such conduct \nwould be treated as consent to jurisdiction. Id. at 151 \n(Alito, J.). The Constitution does not excuse such sophisti-\ncated entities from the consequences of their informed \nchoices. \nB \nTo avoid this conclusion, the panel analogized personal \njurisdiction to other constitutional rights, such as the Sixth \nAmendment right to a jury trial and the states\u2019 sovereign \nimmunity from suit. Fuld, 82 F.4th at 98-100. The concur-\nrence relies on the same comparisons. See ante at 11-12. \nBut the analogies do not work. Imagine the statute the Su-\npreme Court upheld in Mallory applied to the Sixth \nAmendment right to a jury trial. The statute would read: \n\u201c[A]ny foreign corporation that registers to do business in \nPennsylvania automatically consents to waive its Sixth \nAmendment right to trial by jury.\u201d Or apply it to state sov-\nereign immunity: \u201c[A]ny state whose agent operates in \nPennsylvania automatically waives its state sovereign im-\nmunity.\u201d These statutes would not be upheld as easily as \nthe Mallory statute.17 \nA \u201ctribunal\u2019s competence\u201d to exercise personal juris-\ndiction has been \u201cgenerally constrained only by the \u2018terri-\ntorial limits\u2019 of the sovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 128 (plurality opinion) (quoting Story, supra, \u00a7 539, \nat 450-51). Personal jurisdiction therefore depends on the \npowers assigned to the state and federal governments. \nNeither an enumerated right nor sovereign immunity \nworks the same way. This becomes obvious when we \n \n17 Nor would a state be able to deprive a defendant of the right to \ntrial by jury if the defendant takes \u201csome act by which [it] purposefully \navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum \nState.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958). \n\n248a \n \n \nconsider tag jurisdiction. There is no question that if an \nindividual official of the PLO and the PA visited the \nUnited States, he could be served personally with process \nand thereby subjected to the jurisdiction of American \ncourts. A deemed-consent statute such as the PSJVTA is \nsimply the adaptation of tag jurisdiction to artificial per-\nsons and works the same way.18 By contrast, no statute \ncould deem mere presence in the United States to be a \nwaiver of the right to trial by jury. \nII \nEven if the panel were correct that the Constitution \nrequires a deemed-consent statute to be based on a benefit \nto a defendant in exchange for jurisdiction, there still \nwould be jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in these \ncases. \nA \nThe complaint alleges that the PLO and the PA main-\ntained premises and engaged in official activities in \nthe United States knowing that such conduct in the \nUnited States would result in the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction.

That is because the \nconcurrence fails to appreciate the explanation in Mallory that \ndeemed-consent statutes \u201cadapt the traditional rule about transitory \nactions for individuals to artificial persons created by law.\u201d Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 129 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 139-40 & n.7 (explain-\ning that \u201cwe have already turned aside arguments very much like Nor-\nfolk Southern\u2019s\u201d in Burnham v.

The PLO and \nthe PA faced a choice between (1) refraining from main-\ntaining an office and engaging in covered activity within \nthe United States and thereby avoiding personal jurisdic-\ntion and (2) maintaining an office and engaging in covered \nactivity and thereby consenting to personal jurisdiction. \nThe defendants knowingly and voluntarily opted for the \nbenefits of residing and acting in the United States. \nThe panel, however, reasoned that \u201cthe statute does \nnot provide the PLO or the PA with any such benefit or \npermission\u201d because \u201cfederal law has long prohibited the \ndefendants from engaging in any activities or maintaining \nany offices in the United States, absent specific executive \nor statutory waivers.\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 92. The fact that \nthe PLO and the PA extracted a benefit from the United \nStates in violation of the law\u2014and additionally benefited \nfrom the federal government\u2019s nonenforcement of the \nlaw\u2014does not alter the fact that those organizations re-\nceived the benefit from the forum that the statute envi-\nsions. See Pa. Fire, 243 U.S. at 96 (noting that a corpora-\ntion \u201cwould be presumed to have assented\u201d to jurisdiction \nbased on \u201ca mere fiction, justified by holding the corpora-\ntion estopped to set up its own wrong as a defense\u201d). \nThe panel insisted that \u201c[t]urning a blind eye to pro-\nhibited conduct that remains subject to sanction or curtail-\nment is not the same as authorizing such conduct,\u201d sug-\ngesting that a party can obtain a benefit from a forum only \nif the forum state affirmatively blesses its conduct. Fuld, \n82 F.4th at 93 n.10. This argument is strange. It means \nthat the Constitution protects a foreign entity from the \n\n250a \n \n \njurisdiction of the federal courts if the entity conducts il-\nlegal activities in the United States but does not extend \nsuch protection to foreign entities that act legally in the \nUnited States. Yet a foreign actor that conducts unau-\nthorized business in the United States has obtained an \neven greater benefit from the forum than the foreign actor \nthat complies with American law. The unauthorized actor \nhas extracted a benefit at the expense of the policy under-\nlying the forum state\u2019s laws while the authorized actor has \nnot benefited from such harm to the forum. Cf. Goodyear \nDunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 926 \n(2011) (noting that personal jurisdiction over \u201ca nonresi-\ndent defendant\u201d may be based on it causing \u201charm inside \nthe forum\u201d). \nIn any event, the conduct of business by the PLO and \nthe PA in the United States was not unauthorized because \nthe federal government followed a nonenforcement policy \nwith respect to its activities, \u201cpermit[ing] certain activities \nas \u2018a matter of grace.\u2019\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 93 n.10 (quoting \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Reply Br. 25). There is no reason for the federal \ncourts to be policing the distinction between a benefit con-\nferred by the executive branch\u2019s enforcement discretion \nand a benefit conferred by the legislative branch\u2019s enact-\nment of legislation. The federal government deals with for-\neign entities through a variety of means, and no law privi-\nleges legislatively conferred benefits over those conferred \nby the executive branch, especially in the field of foreign \nrelations.19 \n \n19 Cf. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 \n(1936) (noting that the \u201cexclusive power of the President as the sole \norgan of the federal government in the field of international relations\u201d \nis \u201ca power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of \nCongress\u201d). \n\n251a \n \n \nAdditionally, the PSJVTA bases personal jurisdiction \non \u201cconduct[ing] any activity while physically present in \nthe United States on behalf of \u2026 the  Palestinian Au-\nthority.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). At least with respect to \nthe PA, most such activities do not appear to be prohibited. \nWhile it is \u201cunlawful to establish or maintain an office, \nheadquarters, premises, or other facilities or establish-\nments within the jurisdiction of the United States at the \nbehest or direction of, or with funds provided by, the Pal-\nestinian Authority\u201d absent certain certifications,20 the \nplaintiffs allege other activities in the United States on be-\nhalf of the PA besides maintaining a facility.21 The re-\nstrictions on activity in the United States on behalf of the \nPLO are broader.22 \nB \nThe concurrence admits that the panel opinion holds \nthat \u201cthe alleged conduct of the PLO and the PA in viola-\ntion of federal restrictions would be an insufficient basis \n\u2026 to confer jurisdiction.\u201d Ante at 15. The concurrence in-\nsists that this result is required because \u201cestablishing \ndeemed-consent jurisdiction based on the alleged un-\nlawful activities undertaken by the PLO and the PA in the \nUnited States would be nothing more than \u2018punishment\u2019 \n \n20 Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, Pub.

The concurrence believes it \nwould be improper for Congress to punish the unlawful \nconduct of the PLO and the PA. But Congress often cre-\nates civil liability to penalize unlawful conduct. The whole \npremise of specific personal jurisdiction is that wrongful \nconduct in the forum gives the forum an interest in subject-\ning the bad actor to the jurisdiction of its courts. See, e.g., \nFord Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. \n351, 355 (2021). And tag jurisdiction, the analogue of \ndeemed-consent statutes, has never been limited only to \nthose lawfully present in the forum. See Burnham, 495 \nU.S. at 610-11. \nIn any event, the PSJVTA simply subjects each defend-\nant to the jurisdiction of the federal courts by virtue of its \nconduct in the forum. That is not a penalty for unlawful \nconduct; it merely extends jurisdiction over parties en-\ngaged in conduct in the forum. The connection to the fo-\nrum, rather than the unlawfulness of the conduct, is what \nestablishes jurisdiction. \nThe concurrence purports to find its novel principle \nabout punishment in the Supreme Court\u2019s gloss on the \nnineteenth-century decision Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 \n(1897). See ante at 17; see also Fuld, 82 F.4th at 94 (discuss-\ning Hovey). According to the concurrence, in Insurance \nCorp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court distinguished the \ncase before it from Hovey, \u201cin which the Court held that it \n\u2018violated due process for a court to take similar action as \npunishment for failure to obey an order to pay into the reg-\nistry of the court a certain sum of money.\u2019\u201d Ante at 17 (in-\nternal quotation marks and alteration omitted) (quoting \nIns. Corp. of Ir., 456 U.S. at 706). In Hovey, as punishment \nfor contempt for failure to comply with the court-ordered \npayment, the supreme court of the District of Columbia \nstruck the defendant\u2019s entire answer from the record \n\n253a \n \n \nand ordered \u201cthat this cause do proceed as if no answer \nherein had been interposed.\u201d 167 U.S. at 411. The U.S. Su-\npreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ccourts have inherent \npower to deny all right to defend an action, and to render \ndecrees without any hearing whatever.\u201d Id. at 414. It dis-\napproved of the D.C. court\u2019s action as inconsistent with due \nprocess because \u201c[a]t common law no man was condemned \nwithout being afforded opportunity to be heard,\u201d id. at \n415, and because it cannot be \u201cdoubted that due process of \nlaw signifies a right to be heard in one\u2019s defense,\u201d id. at 417. \nIn Insurance Corp. of Ireland, the Supreme Court \ncited Hovey for the proposition that it would violate due \nprocess \u201cto create a presumption of fact\u201d regarding per-\nsonal jurisdiction as a punishment without affording the \ndefendant the opportunity to be heard, unless that pre-\nsumption was based on the principle that \u201crefusal to pro-\nduce evidence material to the administration of due pro-\ncess was but an admission of the want of merit in the as-\nserted defense.\u201d 456 U.S. at 705-06 (quoting Hammond \nPacking Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, 350-51 (1909)). \nThe idea expressed in Hovey and Insurance Corp. of \nIreland\u2014that it would violate the Due Process Clause to \ndeny a defendant the opportunity to be heard in its own \ndefense\u2014is well established. But it has nothing to do with \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA. The PLO and the PA \nhave not been denied the opportunity to dispute either the \nfacts on which personal jurisdiction is based or the facts on \nwhich liability is based. There has been no denial of the \ndefendants\u2019 rights to notice and an opportunity to be \nheard, nor did the district court assert personal jurisdic-\ntion over the defendants as a penalty for non- compliance \nwith court orders. Neither Hovey nor Insurance Corp. of \nIreland establishes a general principle that a defendant \ncannot be made subject to suit\u2014about which the \n\n254a \n \n \ndefendant receives notice and an opportunity to be \nheard\u2014when that defendant engages in unlawful conduct. \nBased on that dubious principle, however, the panel has \nadded two requirements on top of the Supreme Court\u2019s \nstraightforward rule for establishing consent-based juris-\ndiction: First, the consent must be granted in exchange for \nthe extension of a benefit to the foreign actor. Second, the \nbenefit must be affirmatively authorized by a statute. \nThese requirements are not rooted in the Constitution, \nand the additional complexity creates needless confusion \nand absurd results. \nIII \nFor the foregoing reasons, even accepting the panel\u2019s \npremise that the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the jurisdiction of the federal courts as the \nFourteenth Amendment imposes on the state courts, the \nPSJVTA still would be constitutional. But the premise is \nincorrect. The Supreme Court has reserved judgment on \n\u201cwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same re-\nstrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a fed-\neral court\u201d as the Fourteenth Amendment does on a state \ncourt. Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 269. Recent \nscholarship has shown that the Fifth Amendment does not \nimpose such limits. See Brief for Constitutional Law Schol-\nars Philip C.

AO Moldovagaz, 2 F.4th \n42, 66 n.23 (2d Cir. 2021). And other judges have argued \nthat the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does \nnot limit the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal \ncourts. See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, 598 (D.C. Cir. \n2023) (Rao, J., concurring) (\u201cThere is little (or no) evidence \nthat courts and commentators in the Founding Era under-\nstood the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause to im-\npose a minimum contacts requirement.

See Sachs, supra, at 1704. The Clause required \nonly that \u201cdeprivations of life, liberty, or property must be \npreceded by process of law in th[e] narrow and technical \nlegal sense\u201d of legitimate service of process that could en-\nsure notice and an opportunity to be heard. Crema & So-\nlum, supra, at 451-52. After the Fifth Amendment was rat-\nified, federal courts continued to follow general law princi-\nples according to which tag jurisdiction allowed anyone \nserved with process in the forum to be subject to personal \njurisdiction there. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128; Massie v. \nWatts, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 162-63 (1810). \u201c[N]ot until \nthe Civil War did a single court, state or federal, hold a \npersonal-jurisdiction statute invalid on due process \ngrounds.\u201d Sachs, supra, at 1712. \nThe history demonstrates that, outside of the limits im-\nposed by service of process, \u201c[a] federal court\u2019s writ may \nrun as far as Congress, within its enumerated powers, \nwould have it go.\u201d Id. at 1704. In the early republic, the \nlimitations on the federal courts\u2019 exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction derived from general and international law\u2014 \nnot from the Fifth Amendment\u2014and Congress could al-\nways override those limitations. Just as states had limited \npower to reach outside their \u201cterritorial limits,\u201d Story, su-\npra, \u00a7 539, at 450, the general law of nations limited the \npower of the national government to exercise jurisdiction \nover persons located abroad, Sachs, supra, at 1708-17. \nHowever, Congress could depart from the default rules \n\n257a \n \n \nof international law by a clearly worded statute, and the Su-\npreme Court said it would honor such laws.23 \nIn 1828, while riding circuit, Justice Story considered \na case in which an alien sued a non-resident American citi-\nzen in federal court. Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 \n(C.C.D. Mass. 1828). Story acknowledged that under \u201cthe \nprinciples of common law,\u201d \u201cin the contemplation of the \nframers of the judiciary act of 1789, \u2026 independent of \nsome positive provision to the contrary, no judgment could \nbe rendered in the circuit court against any person, upon \nwhom process could not be personally served within the \ndistrict.\u201d Id. at 613 (emphasis added). Story recognized \nthat because \u201ca general jurisdiction is given [under Article \nIII] in cases, where an alien is party,\u201d even if the alien \u201cis \nnot an inhabitant of the United States, and has not any \nproperty within it \u2026 still he is amenable to the jurisdiction \nof any circuit court.\u201d Id. If Congress authorized it, \u201ca sub-\nject of England, or France, or Russia, having a contro-\nversy with one of our own citizens, may be summoned from \nthe other end of the globe to obey our process, and submit \nto the judgment of our courts.\u201d Id. While such an extension \nof jurisdiction might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights \nand sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \u201c[i]f congress had \n \n23 See, e.g., The Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815) (\u201cIf it be \nthe will of the government to apply to Spain any rule respecting cap-\ntures which Spain is supposed to apply to us, the government will man-\nifest that will by passing an act for the purpose. Till such an act be \npassed, the Court is bound by the law of nations which is a part of the \nlaw of the land.\u201d); see also Murray v. The Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 \nU.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804) (\u201c[A]n act of Congress ought never to be \nconstrued to violate the law of nations if any other possible construc-\ntion remains.\u201d) (emphasis added); Talbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 \nCranch) 1, 43 (1801) (\u201c[T]he laws of the United States ought not, if it \nbe avoidable, so to be construed as to infract the common principles \nand usages of nations.\u201d) (emphasis added). \n\n258a \n \n \nprescribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound \nto follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613-15. \nThe Supreme Court later embraced that reasoning. \nSee Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 328 (1838). \nIn Toland, an American plaintiff attached the American \nproperty of a defendant domiciled abroad. Id. at 302. The \nSupreme Court decided that the exercise of jurisdiction in \nsuch a case would be \u201cunjust\u201d and that Congress had not \nauthorized such jurisdiction by statute. Id. at 328-29. How-\never, the Court recognized that Story\u2019s analysis in Picquet \nhad \u201cgreat force.\u201d Id. at 328. The Court explained that \n\u201cCongress might have authorized civil process from any \ncircuit court, to have run into any state of the Union,\u201d in-\ncluding as to \u201cpersons in a foreign jurisdiction,\u201d but the \nCourt would not exercise such jurisdiction \u201cindependently \nof positive legislation.\u201d Id. at 330. In this way, the early \ncases show both that the Fifth Amendment did not limit \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction and that Congress \nwas understood to be able to extend such jurisdiction by \nstatute. \nB \nPersonal jurisdiction \u201cperform[s] two related, but dis-\ntinguishable, functions.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 \nU.S. at 291-92. First, it guards against infringements on \nfederalism\u2014that is, \u201cit acts to ensure that the States \nthrough their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits \nimposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in \na federal system.\u201d Id. at 292. Second, it protects an indi-\nvidual liberty interest of \u201cthe defendant against the bur-\ndens of litigating in a distant or inconvenient forum.\u201d Id. \nThese interests are not implicated to the same extent by \nthe federal government as by state governments, so there \nis no reason to expect the Constitution to impose the same \nrestrictions on the federal and state courts in the \n\n259a \n \n \nexercise of personal jurisdiction. Indeed, \u201cpersonal juris-\ndiction requires a forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sov-\nereign, analysis.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). \nThe clearest difference is that federalism does not im-\npose the same restrictions on the federal government as it \ndoes on state governments. \u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction cases \nhave discussed the federalism implications of one State\u2019s \nassertion of jurisdiction over the corporate residents of an-\nother,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality opinion), and \nthe Supreme Court has said that \u201cthis federalism interest \nmay be decisive\u201d in the due process analysis when consid-\nering personal jurisdiction. Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. \nat 263. That is because the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment is \u201can instrument of interstate feder-\nalism.\u201d Id. (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at \n294). Because \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State \u2026 implie[s] \na limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d the \nConstitution must ensure that states do not exceed \u201cthe \nlimits imposed on them by their status as coequal sover-\neigns in a federal system.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 \nU.S. at 292. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not an instrument of interstate federalism. \nWhile states may not intrude on each other\u2019s or the federal \ngovernment\u2019s prerogatives, Congress may decide to in-\ntrude on foreign governments\u2019 prerogatives. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 86 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cIf \nit chooses to do so, [Congress] may legislate with respect \nto conduct outside the United States, in excess of the limits \nposed by international law.\u201d) (quoting United States v. \nPinto-Mejia, 720 F.2d 248, 259 (2d Cir. 1983)). \u201c[W]hether \na judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sov-\nereign has authority to render it,\u201d and the federal and \n\n260a \n \n \nstate governments have different authorities. Nicastro, \n564 U.S. at 884. \nThe panel nonetheless concluded that the Fifth \nAmendment must impose the same limits as the Four-\nteenth Amendment because \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s personal \njurisdiction requirements represent a \u2018restriction on judi-\ncial power\u2019 \u2026 \u2018not as a matter of sovereignty, but as a mat-\nter of individual liberty.\u2019\u201d Fuld, 82 F.4th at 103 (alterations \nomitted) (quoting Nicastro, 564 U.S. at 884). However, the \nliberty interest in avoiding inconvenient litigation is also \ndramatically different in the context of the federal courts. \nBecause \u201cdue process protects the individual\u2019s right to be \nsubject only to lawful power,\u201d Nicastro, 564 U.S. at 884, \nthe Supreme Court has emphasized the liberty interest in \navoiding compulsory process that exceeds \u201c\u2018territorial lim-\nitations\u2019 on state power,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 156 (Alito, \nJ.) (quoting Hanson, 357 U.S. at 251). The burden on a de-\nfendant\u2019s liberty interest encompasses \u201cthe practical \nproblems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also \nencompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to \nthe coercive power of a State that may have little legiti-\nmate interest in the claims in question.\u201d Bristol-Myers \nSquibb, 582 U.S. at 263. A defendant in one state generally \ndoes not have \u201cfair warning that a particular activity may \nsubject [it] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d \nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 472 (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, \n433 U.S. 186, 218 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in the \njudgment)), because a state does not normally regulate ac-\ntivity beyond its borders. So \u201cthe Due Process Clause \n\u2018gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that \nallows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that \nconduct will and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297). \n\n261a \n \n \nThe same limitations do not apply to the federal \ncourts.24 In contrast to state legislatures, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991). In the context of taxing \nextraterritorial property, the Supreme Court has ob-\nserved that while the \u201climits of jurisdiction\u201d of states must \n\u201cbe ascertained in each case with appropriate regard to \u2026 \nthe view of the relation of the states to each other in the \nFederal Union,\u201d there is no basis in the Due Process \nClause to \u201cconstruct[] an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurpose of shutting that government off from the exertion \nof powers which inherently belong to it by virtue of its sov-\nereignty.\u201d Burnet v. Brooks, 288 U.S. 378, 401, 404-05 \n(1933). The authority of Congress to assert legislative \npower extraterritorially means that the federal courts \nmust have a corresponding power to adjudicate disputes \nconcerning its laws. \u201cIf there are such things as political \naxioms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \n \n24 Cf.

Ante at \n19-20. But, tellingly, the concurrence does not even mention \u201cfederal-\nism\u201d in its analysis. The Supreme Court, however, has told us that the \ndue process limitations on personal jurisdiction in the state courts re-\nflect the states\u2019 \u201cstatus as coequal sovereigns in a federal system,\u201d \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 292, and that \u201cthis federalism \ninterest may be decisive\u201d in determining the reach of the state courts, \nBristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263. \n\n263a \n \n \nMiller, 389 U.S. 429, 432 (1968). When Congress legislates \non foreign affairs matters that \u201cimplicate[] sensitive and \nweighty interests of national security,\u201d as in these cases, \nits judgments are \u201centitled to deference.\u201d Holder v.

The federal \ngovernment has broad authority to respond to terrorist at-\ntacks against Americans that foreign entities support. The \nstates do not have the same authority to respond to such \nattacks abroad. Generally, state criminal law is territori-\nally limited. See, e.g., Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.03. The United \nStates, by contrast, may criminalize extraterritorial con-\nduct pursuant to its power to \u201cdefine and punish Piracies \nand Felonies committed on the high seas, and Offences \nagainst the Law of Nations,\u201d as well as its power to make \nlaws necessary and proper for regulating foreign com-\nmerce. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 3, 10, 18. The extraterri-\ntorial application of American criminal law requires only \u201ca \nsufficient nexus between the defendant and the United \nStates, so that such application would not be arbitrary or \nunfair.\u201d United States v.

It \ndoes not make sense to conclude that the PLO and the PA \nhave no constitutional right to be free from prosecution, \nsanctions, or war in response to supporting terrorism but \nhave an inviolable liberty interest in avoiding a civil suit in \nfederal court on the same basis. \nThe concurrence quotes a six-year-old amicus brief \nfrom the Justice Department in an earlier case for the \nproposition that the panel\u2019s earlier holding on personal ju-\nrisdiction might have allowed some Americans injured by \ninternational terrorism to seek relief in other hypothetical \ncases\u2014even though the panel opinion forecloses such re-\nlief in these cases. See ante at 23-24. The Justice Depart-\nment intervened here, however, to defend the constitu-\ntionality of the PSJVTA, which Congress adopted \u201c[t]o en-\nsure American victims of international terrorism are able \nto seek redress in U.S. courts.\u201d Intervenor-Appellant\u2019s \nPetition for Rehearing En Banc at 1, Fuld v.

Although due pro-\ncess might protect persons from being subject to extrater-\nritorial adjudication in states whose power the Constitu-\ntion generally limits territorially, the same limitations do \nnot apply to courts established by a sovereign authority \nwith sweeping extraterritorial power. Accordingly, the \nFifth Amendment does not preclude the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction in these cases. \n* \n* \n* \nI would rehear these cases en banc to establish three \npropositions. First, deemed-consent statutes do not re-\nquire an exchange of benefits as long as consent is knowing \nand voluntary and the conduct has a nexus to the forum. \nSecond, even if reciprocity were required, the PSJVTA in-\nvolves such reciprocity because the PLO and the PA re-\nceived benefits by operating in the United States, regard-\nless of whether such operations were lawful. Third, the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not limit \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal courts \nin the same way as the Fourteenth Amendment restricts \nthe state courts. In these cases, the Fifth Amendment \ndoes not leave Congress powerless to afford relief to \n \n31 Members of Congress who adopted the PSJVTA similarly do not \nshare the concurrence\u2019s confidence that the panel opinion does not un-\ndermine the ability of Congress to allow American victims of interna-\ntional terrorism to seek redress.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's cert-stage dynamics remains stable, as the latest observation was a reflection of my internal reasoning rather than new external evidence. My belief state is therefore preserved, but the observation reinforces the critical nature of a known information gap.\n\nMy beliefs are structured as follows:\n\n*   **Respondents' Strategy (Stable and Confirmed):** My high-confidence analysis of the Brief in Opposition (BIO) remains the bedrock of my understanding. The PLO and PA are attempting to dissuade the Court from granting certiorari by arguing:\n    *   **Misapplication of Precedent:** The Second Circuit correctly applied *Insurance Corp. of Ireland* and *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.*, and the PSJVTA's \"deemed consent\" is a legal fiction that cannot create personal jurisdiction where none exists.\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture:** The petitioners and the U.S. Government failed to raise their current Fifth Amendment arguments in the lower courts, providing the Supreme Court with a procedural reason to deny the petition under the \"pass-below\" rule.\n    *   **Governmental Inconsistency:** The U.S. government's current support for the petitioners' position is undermined by its previous skepticism expressed in a 2018 brief, signaling a weak or conflicted stance.\n\n*   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments (Stable and Confirmed):** The respondents continue to frame this specific case as unsuitable for Supreme Court review due to:\n    *   **Lack of Circuit Split:** The absence of conflicting rulings from different circuit courts on the PSJVTA's constitutionality suggests the issue is not yet \"ripe\" for review and should be allowed to \"percolate\" further in the lower courts.\n    *   **Case-Specific Flaws:** The existence of other pending cases and unique procedural issues in this one make it a less-than-ideal vehicle for setting a broad constitutional precedent.\n    *   **Separation of Powers Concerns:** A subtle argument that Congress, by \"deeming\" consent, is impermissibly dictating factual findings to the judiciary, which could violate the principles laid out in *United States v. Klein*.\n\n*   **Petitioners' Position (Gap Reaffirmed):** My previous belief state identified a critical gap: the substance of the petitioners' arguments for certiorari. The latest observation, being an internal thought process, did not fill this gap. I have confirmed the procedural fact that the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has been filed**, but its contents remain unknown to me. My understanding of the case is therefore fundamentally one-sided.\n\n*   **Prediction Focus and Uncertainty:** My predictive focus remains on the immediate question of whether the Court will grant certiorari. The current observation reinforces my assessment that I cannot make a high-confidence prediction without understanding the petitioners' counterarguments. The strength of the respondents' procedural and \"poor vehicle\" arguments appears significant, but their true weight can only be measured against the petitioners' case for why this issue is of national importance and why the Second Circuit's ruling was egregiously wrong. My next critical step remains unchanged: I must locate and analyze the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to understand how the petitioners frame the constitutional question and rebut the respondents' arguments for denial.",

          "task_beliefs": "The latest observation, the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, has filled the critical information gap I previously identified. My understanding of the case has shifted from a one-sided view based on the respondents' opposition to a more complete, two-sided perspective of the cert-stage battle. My confidence in predicting the outcome has increased significantly.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n*   **Petitioners' Certiorari Strategy (New and Foundational):** I now have a comprehensive understanding of the petitioners' arguments for why the Supreme Court must hear this case. Their strategy is multi-pronged and directly targets classic criteria for granting certiorari.\n    *   **Exceptional Importance:** The central pillar of their argument is that the Second Circuit's facial invalidation of a major federal anti-terrorism statute (the PSJVTA) is an act of \"exceptional importance\" that, on its own, warrants immediate review. They frame the PSJVTA as a critical tool for U.S. foreign policy and national security, enacted by Congress to provide a remedy for American victims of terrorism.\n    *   **Fundamental Constitutional Error (5th vs. 14th Amendment):** The petitioners' core legal argument is that the Second Circuit committed a fundamental error by applying personal jurisdiction standards developed for states under the Fourteenth Amendment to a federal statute governed by the Fifth Amendment. They argue that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not impose the same territorial limitations on Congress's power, especially in matters of foreign affairs. This presents the Court with a clean, significant constitutional question.\n    *   **Conflict with Supreme Court Precedent (*Mallory*):** The petitioners argue the Second Circuit's decision is in direct conflict with the Court's recent ruling in *Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co.* They contend that *Mallory* affirmed the validity of \"deemed consent\" jurisdiction based on a defendant's conduct within a statutory framework. The Second Circuit's invention of a \"reciprocity\" or \"governmental benefit\" test, they argue, is an impermissible gloss on\u2014and a direct contradiction of\u2014the principles established in *Mallory*.\n    *   **Error Even Under the Wrong Standard:** As a fallback, petitioners argue that even under the Fourteenth Amendment framework, the PSJVTA is constitutional. They assert it satisfies the \"fair warning\" standard from *Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct.* because the statute explicitly told the PLO and PA what conduct would trigger jurisdiction.\n    *   **Ideal Vehicle Rebuttal:** The petitioners directly counter the respondents' \"poor vehicle\" argument by framing the case as an \"ideal vehicle.\" They present a clear legal question, a facial invalidation of a statute, and a robust factual record, making it a perfect case to resolve the constitutional issue.\n\n*   **Respondents' Strategy (Stable but Contextualized):** My understanding of the respondents' arguments from their Brief in Opposition remains stable, but they are now contextualized by the petitioners' direct rebuttals.\n    *   **Misapplication of Precedent:** The respondents' claim that the Second Circuit correctly applied *Mallory* is now directly challenged by the petitioners' argument that the lower court invented a \"governmental benefit\" test that *Mallory* does not support.\n    *   **\"Poor Vehicle\" Arguments:** The respondents' arguments about the lack of a circuit split and case-specific flaws are significantly weakened by the petitioners' powerful \"exceptional importance\" and \"ideal vehicle\" framing. The facial invalidation of a federal national security statute is often a compelling reason for review, even without a circuit split.\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture:** The \"pass-below\" argument remains a potential procedural hurdle, but its force may be diminished if the Court views the constitutional question as sufficiently important and cleanly presented.\n\n*   **Prediction Focus and Uncertainty:** My focus remains on the cert-grant question. However, my uncertainty has substantially decreased. The petitioners have presented multiple, powerful reasons for the Court to grant review: (1) the facial invalidation of a federal statute, (2) a direct conflict with recent Supreme Court precedent (*Mallory*), and (3) a fundamental constitutional question regarding congressional power under the Fifth Amendment. These are compelling hooks for certiorari. While the respondents' procedural arguments have some weight, the substantive importance of the issues raised by the petitioners makes a grant of certiorari appear much more likely than it did with only the respondents' brief in view. The next key evidence will be the U.S. government's brief as amicus curiae, which will signal the Executive Branch's position on these arguments.",
